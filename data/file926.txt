9260021 these incidents have saddened me because whereas the whole of cyprus should be celebrating the victory of these teams these people chose to blacken their teams victory in this particular way

9260029 almost 90 per cent of people aged 25 to 34 say they have dabbled with some other form of media while watching tv or using the internet almost half say they have listened to the radio or watched tv while online
9260030 three quarters of 20 to 34 year olds regularly use their mobile when in front of the tv while more than a third of 25 to 44 year olds often check the internet at the same time as watching a programme

9260036 it would appear that bryans may be taking part in unofficial discussions
9260037 bryans idea is that the world ought to be divided into two parts that germany should be given a free hand in europe and that the british empire should run the rest of the world
9260038 i am not sure that this is a very desirable point of view to publish at the present time
9260039 bryans is a talkative and indiscreet fellow who is in possession of a story which he delights in telling and which if told publicly would be likely to cause embarrassment to the foreign office
9260040 although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views to all and sundry i understand that if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office and the facilities afforded him to go to italy
9260041 it occurs to me that this is a possible means of putting deception over to the enemy by the careful framing of the questionnaires as presumably the germans must if they capture some of these birds take notice of the type of question which is being asked

9260049 i am writing on behalf of my aged mother 84 years old
9260050 she is a frequent customer of shop and save at pasir ris drive 4
9260051 many a times she told us that she was overcharged for things that she did not buy
9260052 on two occasions it was just 2 and another occasion 3 over dollars
9260053 those times when she told us it was late evening when we family members were home from work
9260054 the lapse between her claims was more than 8 hours so we did not bother to approach shop and save for the difference
9260055 however on national day she was again charged for 5 kg of rice that she did not buy
9260056 this time we were at home i was very angry because 5kg and all the items she bought in the pictures are too heavy for an old lady to carry and walk more than 1 km home
9260057 we went back to shop and save and asked for the store manager a lady came but did not identify herself
9260058 we showed her the bag of items we bought asked her three times why my mother was overcharged but she remained silent and walked away and murmuring
9260059 i lost my cool and shouted and her asking her what she meant by that
9260060 just then a man came out and identified himself as the store manager he had witnessed his staff attitude and apologised
9260061 then he said he will investigate the matter of overcharging
9260062 we were refunded the difference but i did not hear any more from the management except receiving just a call from store manager that it was just a mistake
9260063 i have a concern here how can the staff just say
9260064 shoppers check your receipt when you make purchases or you will be the losers

9260074 likewise teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine but to teach what is good then they can train the younger women to love their husbands and children to be self controlled and pure to be busy at home to be kind and to be subject to their husbands so that no one will malign the word of god

9260080 now as the three month trial of eight defendants draws to a close prosecutors indeed have presented evidence of meticulous planning with experiments on a new kind of bomb research into plane schedules videos threatening martyrdom an apartment purchased for more than 270 000 in cash and a mysterious outsider with strong ties to pakistan but the testimony has shown little evidence that the suspects were prepared to strike immediately or of any link to al qaeda potential vulnerabilities in the case that several defendants have tried to capitalize on in court
9260081 america is a beautiful country and it is full of kind loving and caring people
9260082 as for that vp talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that that vp slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up here for the rest of the u s before i can even start addressing that question
9260083 we may not think theyre actual girlfriends but they do and i think its hilarious
9260084 she was a tough old lady aunts often were in those days
9260085 guess what i got my depressed client to do today
9260086 and my client with spending issues keeps coming back she hasent realized yet i am one of the problems and not the solution at 500 a session
9260087 yes dad yes mom this is really what i want
9260088 the real triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other
9260089 not to say it hasnt crossed my mind or andys or stewarts
9260090 it is a celebration i think it is important that things have an ending i think americans call it closure things dont last forever we all have our interests and our needs and we will carry on making music this was never meant to be forever nothing is
9260091 she has remained in the detention center for the past two years denied bail and denied any hearing on the merits of the mexican charges
9260092 she was let go by the mexican police after her arrest and heard nothing about the matter for the next eight years
9260093 but she will never be able to prove it now nearly 10 years after the fact
9260094 while he notes that religious people often look to the church to help with these efforts
9260095 were trying to prepare a national action week to mobilize the community before congress comes back this is really it we have three legislative weeks left before they members of the house of representatives campaign
9260096 were hoping that our champions will live up to their pledge we are within reach
9260097 realistically we are done for this congressional session and would have to start over again next year
9260098 what he really wanted to do was to jump start talks again
9260099 it worked speaker nancy pelosi d ca spoke on the filipinos wwii veterans behalf of course steve buyer r in ranking member of the house committee on veterans affairs opposed it chet edwards d tx head of the veterans affairs appropriations subcommittee gave his support so in that sense it was positive
9260100 in reality the money set aside for the filipino wwii veterans would not really take away from the disabled veterans the disability pension was not being distributed correctly so really its restoring the original intent
9260101 the problem is that our champions and democratic supporters have allowed the republicans to set the debate terms and standards
9260102 during this recess time community members should make an appointment to see their congressperson just to remind them about the filipino wwii veterans equity bill
9260103 i think we have enough members of the house to support this bill
9260104 we are a community that has never engaged in a campaign like this before
9260105 i know its hard to deal with this veterans fatigue but the veterans have been marching 60 years
9260106 our manongs marched for more than 62 years were asking the community to march with them for the next 62 days
9260107 the girl was much more effective at 120 than she was at 135
9260108 she was very durable and quick not to say that ana didnt fight a good fight ana fought well i think a few adjustments here and there and we could have outpointed olivo
9260109 i wanted to pressure her and throw the stronger punches
9260110 i wanted to work the body to the head and use my hooks and you saw what happened
9260111 im not sure if she over prepared i feel like ana was a little flat in the fight not so much her hands but her legs
9260112 i think going into this fight i was too excited
9260113 i knew she was a forward fighter but my ego got the best of me in terms of me just wanting to go in there and slug it out with her
9260114 shes a strong fighter i just didnt get off the way i wanted to
9260115 the best thing is to leave it all behind and continue on to be better no excuses on anything i just need to try to get better next time ill do whatever it takes to get to the next level
9260116 look i went on record on saying that we had five top five women in the world who turned down this fight
9260117 why is ana the one challenging people when it should be the other way around
9260118 by spending time with god you can be filled with the holy spirit and controlled by his power to live a calm life with a well balanced mind of discipline and self control
9260119 you will not enjoy your day if anything is out of control you can keep your temper moods emotions appetite mouth and thoughts in line with gods word if you give him control over the areas you want to subdue with faith god created us with a free will and we can choose the thing that is best for us be free from old destructive habits by simply forming new ones dont let your emotions get out of control use the self control that he freely makes available to you
9260120 her mouth seemed punched in and her genitalia were swollen
9260121 im really excited to go to the philippines partly to learn more about where my parents came from i think that it will be an enriching experience
9260122 right now there are 1700 gk villages in almost all the provinces
9260123 we provide for youth development pre school care we provide for a health component livelihood and productivity for the villages and value formation for the beneficiaries its really a partnership with the local government
9260124 we invite volunteers high school and college students who are willing to give one week a month to help with gks different programs
9260125 i think so many people in this world do not realize the joy that they will receive from giving that they cannot receive in any other way the joy that is beyond wealth
9260126 i was extremely involved in social justice and giving service to others
9260127 i knew that there was nothing i would want to do except to work with gks projects that are so special and serve so many people
9260128 ive been leaning towards doing an international service for quite sometime
9260129 you know you have people going home on sunday evening usually on monday evening most people have to be at work by tuesday it usually picks up in the evening when people come in
9260130 i think in the ivory tower theres a problem with researching a group without ever talking to them in academia its all about measuring in quantitative stats culture matters cops live and work there so they can see it it cannot all be explained by money academics think its all about racism and economics
9260131 they told me i was going to a contending team and that made it a little easier to accept than if i was going to a team that was out of the race that would have been different
9260132 the last we heard is that your civil service card is handled by an officer in the dept but she he left the service a year ago

9260138 stronger families equal safer communities so its a community based response
9260139 any time law enforcement can get involved and bring awareness to this type of activity its got to be a positive

9260141 asean has already announced deals with china to be phased in by 2010 and japan by 2012 there is a potential to have a regional a free trade area stretching from hokkaido in the north of japan to invercargill on the very southern tip of the south island of new zealand
9260142 the asean experts group on trademark has finalized the asean filing form for trademarks and the notes for the completion of the application these achievements together with the completed asean common form and the consolidated asean list of ethnic goods and services represent important steps forward in the regional cooperation in ip despite its inherent complexities member countries have continued their efforts in the harmonization of the trademark filing requirements this is a process of significant importance towards the establishment of a regional filing system

9260145 without the ability for these teams to travel with their boat on a trailer the sport would be hurt and obviously the revenue would be shrinking in the communities these events are held in
9260146 only one in ten people with developmental disabilities who wants to work currently has a job thats down twenty percent in the last ten years because the funding for job development has been cut dramatically
9260147 i urge colorado voters to pass 51 colorado citizens are proud and i think when they realize colorado is 46th in taking care of its most vulnerable citizens i think theyll be willing to pay a little more two tenths of one percent is such a small price to help
9260148 most citizens want to help people with developmental disabilities but most people dont know how bad it is these are real people in real need of the 12 000 on the list nearly 3 000 come from jefferson county alone

9260160 the question is how this will be received by a lot of rank and file evangelicals who are just americans struggling along going to their megachurches and care about values
9260161 we played the game we love the game we know how to play and could have scored more
9260162 in the second half we were far the better side but we didnt take our chances
9260163 were disappointed because there were a lot of situations where we felt we could have scored goals
9260164 we came out in the second half and really took the game to them and we had a chance of an equaliser from the penalty spot but it wasnt to be
9260165 it was a hard fought victory and we made hard work of it we should have had it wrapped up long before we actually did
9260166 we need to be more ruthless in both boxes the penalty was a bit of a turning point at 2 0 they would have been dead and buried
9260167 the pleasing thing is that we kept our nerve and tuncay came up with a great finish to give us the win
9260168 all rob green can do is keep playing as he is
9260169 week in week out he puts his performances in and often they go unnoticed
9260170 ive said it to him before that sometimes he will stand out a little more and that happened today
9260171 apart from the penalty save he was putting crosses under pressure and we know his performances should give him an england call up
9260172 lets hope we can take a big boost from the result today
9260173 i thought we started ever so well today very similar to the wigan game and got ourselves into a 2 0 lead
9260174 but credit to blackburn they came back and got back into the game straight away after our second goal
9260175 and really it was them that were forcing the issue in the second half but we held out and sometimes thats the way it is
9260176 i think when you sit down and watch the game again youll realise that there could have been more goals because there were lots of chances
9260177 the players and i need a rest and well be going away for four or five days
9260178 its good that its come at this time before newcastle next week
9260179 they had five shots on target and won 5 0
9260180 everyone says what its going to be like in the premier league but in the first half it was hull city not wigan who beat hull city
9260181 we slipped up but with five shots on target 5 0 is a tough one to swallow
9260182 we were without george boateng anthony gardner and marlon king for various reasons and what we had out there was a championship team
9260183 we have got four or five irons in the fire at the moment two of which are pretty well down the line and three which are could bees maybes and he zayatte is one of those could be maybes
9260184 we have had him training this morning he looks like a player who could certainly improve us
9260185 he plays three or four positions and i like those sort of players
9260186 we were well in the game until the sending off
9260187 i havent seen it on tv yet so i wont say anything about the sending off
9260188 but it was a great free kick that followed and you cant do anything about that
9260189 the players had to work so hard out there to get something out of the game
9260190 and i thought we would come away with something after we scored and took the steam out of them
9260191 to play a long time with 10 men and get an equaliser then get punished like that after a mis hit shot drops to somebody in the box is tough on our lads
9260192 good players will move the ball around against 10 men and they did that to us but our lads kept on working
9260193 he atouba originally wanted to travel to england on friday to undergo a medical with premier league club newcastle united but then surprisingly turned up at team training
9260194 because the cameroonians future is unclear coach martin jol has removed him from the squad for arminia bielefeld
9260195 i do not know what response i will get on sunday from villa fans but i will be only concentrating on what goes on out on the pitch
9260196 i do not want to say too much i do not want to analyse too much what has gone on before because we cannot change things now
9260197 i am now only concerned with how to beat villa and how to control barry on the pitch
9260198 do i have a good relationship with martin oneill i dont think so but of course i will shake his hand i am a calm man and i do not have any problems with him about that
9260199 i had a good relationship with martin oneill before this summer and i was surprised at what has been said but i insist that i have not spoken to him since april
9260200 but i do not believe there will be any problem shaking hands we can do it
9260201 we know that barry is a good player very good for them
9260202 terrorists have kidnapped hillary clinton rosie odonnell jesse jackson and al sharpton they are asking for a 10 million ransom otherwise they are going to douse them with gasoline and set them on fire we are going from car to car taking up a collection
9260203 we need to be as close as possible to whatever areas theyre going to have us cover
9260204 were specialized in concrete collapse heavy collapse like concrete buildings but we will do any type of rescue that is required combined space water rescue
9260205 they go out on missions they got out and they go through the rubble piles check all the homes and and things like that i have like all kind of rescue tools and saws on my truck
9260206 thats why were all here thats the reason we spend all the time off the clock away from our families doing all the training getting ready for this because we wanted to do this
9260207 ofcom has outlined a range of options from the evolution of the status quo to alternative funding models one option would be a fund available to commercial public service broadcasters to ensure future competitiveness in psb without calling on the treasury or taking from the bbc one single penny of the licence fee needed for its core purposes
9260208 the bbcs main activities should be the promotion of its public purposes through the provision of output which consists of information education and entertainment
9260209 it was really good to see all of our middles contributing when they had their chances
9260210 we were able to sustain a level of focus and intensity throughout the entire match
9260211 wisconsin has a lot of talent and is a very good team
9260212 i didnt think we showed the toughness and passion down the stretch that we had against pittsburgh we had some opportunities at the end of all three sets but we just didnt capitalize on our chances
9260213 uk is right there with them now we just need to start going out and proving that
9260214 i thought our team showed some toughness to finish the match with a win after struggling during the fourth set
9260215 they are going to win a lot of matches this year for us to be able and win a close match like this where both teams were giving everything they had in the fifth set will go a long way for our season
9260216 they tottenham had several weeks of time to buy him and they did not offer 22 million like everybody has been writing but just 16 million
9260217 hes due to arrive in england on saturday but as a free agent he is not under pressure to sign before the transfer window closes so we will evaluate all the options open to him
9260218 louis is a good centre forward who has a bit of everything
9260219 he can run head the ball and score goals and he has not cost us any money
9260220 there will be some money after hes played some games but there is no initial outlay and he has to play before we pay
9260221 i enjoyed every minute at newcastle it was a fantastic club i enjoyed working with the manager and they are a great bunch of lads
9260222 but i knew offers had come in over the summer and the club had turned them down and the valuation of me wasnt reflected in the deal i was on
9260223 speaking to them i felt it was the right thing to put in a transfer request to show how i felt seeing as they didnt think they were on the same wavelength as me and they then made the decision to sell me
9260224 it was newcastles decision and now i am at aston villa a new contract was never discussed that was a source of frustration
9260225 i nearly signed two years ago that was a tough time for me and villa as well it obviously threw their plans into turmoil that was a tough time
9260226 you learn from that and you move on and two years later i am sure i am a stronger character and a better player for those experiences
9260227 the fee had been agreed i came down here to the training ground and got into the managers office and he said he had a phone call to say newcastle had changed their mind
9260228 at first i didnt know if it was the managers humour and whether he was joking with me but it wasnt a joke
9260229 i know what has been said about me about being anti english but i dont know why
9260230 when i spoke about the debts of certain clubs everybody said it was directed at the english clubs but we have many problems in clubs across europe many clubs that have run up massive debts
9260231 clubs like steaua bucharest and cska moscow have already been punished because they dont have respect because they dont have the money but they buy players
9260232 players will come in and go out and wed like to be on the back end of one deal where we get another defender because i think were a bit short on experience
9260233 its anyones guess but it seems the people he owed money to are big companies and i cant see them behind something like this
9260234 just flipped the pressure of it was too much for him
9260235 he was an ordinary business salesman running a company and a family man
9260236 he was just an ordinary everyday chap well dressed a good businessman
9260237 that is why people burn out stolen cars and why people set fire to crime scenes
9260238 it is not the case the scene is completely helpless but the police have an extremely difficult case on their hands
9260239 kirstie joined our school about half way through year 8 and i have known her since then this has all come as a shock to everyone
9260240 she is a really nice person and gets on with everyone she never argues with people
9260241 as you can see kirstie and family not only are your close friends and fellow ellesmerians worried for you but the whole nation also the caring people of the world are rooting for investigators to find you safe and away from the blaze that swept through your house
9260242 to kirstie and family i hope with all my heart you and your family are safe nothing bad deserves to happen to any of you you are such a great girl and a close friend thinking of you and again hoping you are all okay
9260243 kirstie i hope you are okay you are one of my closest friends we have had our ups and downs as friends but you mean so much to me as a friend i hope you are okay you dont deserve it and nor do your mum and dad
9260244 kirstie and family i hope that you are all okay you are such nice people and make this world a better place thinking of you and the family
9260245 i hope the fosters are not in the house and are safe and that kirstie will be okay as i go to school with her and hope to see her there in two weeks
9260246 kirstie i hope i pray you are out there somewhere in safety we were good friends and we were close kirstie is a great person and she does not deserve this to happen to her nor her family
9260247 parents should be celebrating that by paying into a child trust fund they are going to be making a real difference to their childs future and also their own by making the decision to prepare for future financial burdens early parents can help to limit any potential impact on their own pocket at a time when they might be contemplating retirement or becoming mortgage free
9260248 todays six year olds and their younger counterparts are benefiting from a national savings and investment scheme that we hope will continue to revolutionise the savings culture in the uk
9260249 when a man or woman young or old takes a place on the picket line for even a day or two he will never be the same again he has confirmed his own humanity through non violence he has confirmed the humanity of others
9260250 i do think i need to win but it is feasible and it would be a wonderful way to make the team
9260251 ollys the favorite but ill see if i can make him sweat a little
9260252 i think youve got plenty out of me this week thank you very much
9260253 i drove the ball well and i was never in a position to cause any angst or anxiety
9260254 but it was so cool the ball just wasnt going anywhere
9260255 i used the long putter for the first time this week and i made some putts yesterday and today
9260256 dan moreland had this vision he found her and got her going she crept down the coast of norway and across to denmark and then she came down and the weather wasnt very bright and she decided it was more sensible to pop in for some shelter
9260257 she came in to ipswich and she lay there the entire winter about until she was due to be charged taxes
9260258 i think they came to me for some materials and we befriended the crew
9260259 the owner was off trying to raise funds and the crew were living on the breadline all over the christmas period
9260260 i particularly befriended the sail maker because he got appendicitis and ended up recovering in our house
9260261 the minesweeper service lost more ships than any other branch of the royal navy as sweeping mines was very dangerous work
9260262 in fact one day while on patrol a mine exploded under the ship and lifted her clean out of the water all 300 tons of her fortunately no real damage occurred
9260263 i was in peru on a school trip when i found out id got the scholarship i was quite surprised but really happy
9260264 it will be some time before i know if ive made the 2012 team i have to make the under 18s team and then hopefully ill get into the under 21s then ill know if ive made it
9260265 we had too many service errors 11 today and only one service ace we gave our opponent too many points our serving and blocking has to get better
9260266 i am pleased with the way niki and kelly played they both hit around 230 which is good for them
9260267 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9260268 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9260269 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9260270 with an occupancy of three or four apartments it is always a concern
9260271 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9260272 this is a little more than what we had in mind in such a short time
9260273 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9260274 it was the place where she learned how much she loved special education where she decided to become a special ed teacher
9260275 we know how proud ellen would be to help raise funds and how much it meant to her and we hope to see a lot of people there
9260276 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9260277 government is needed to distribute to people less fortunate than us
9260278 god whispers to us in our pleasures speaks in our conscience but shouts in our pains it is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world
9260279 see to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on christ
9260280 indy has done some training with us and is feeling good
9260281 there was a chance he may have been included in todays game but we have decided to give him another couple of days before he comes into consideration
9260282 we are anticipating he will be available for selection on tuesday night whether he is in the 16 remains to be seen
9260283 i think we are looking at another eight or 10 weeks before jimmy because he has got a lot of work to do
9260284 matty is due to have his plaster off on monday but if we see him in action again before the end of the year we will be very fortunate
9260285 i think we are looking at the turn of the year before we can think about matty
9260286 its always disappointing not to be playing when youre a professional footballer but you just have to bide your time and wait for a chance
9260287 we will see how things go but football is a strange old game and things can change quickly
9260288 i have been used to playing first team football but luke has done well and we have defended very well as a team
9260289 im happy at the club its a club going forward and i want to be a part of a successful club
9260290 we havent spoken about the start at length as players the main target is just to get the points on the board
9260291 but its going well and the big thing for me is how much fitter we look
9260292 its not like last season when we started a lot of games well but were really hanging on at the end
9260293 we are planning games better and managing what we are doing in games better
9260294 the gaffer has brought in some experienced players and i think that has made a really big difference as well
9260295 coming back from injury this is really just my third race back
9260296 cycling is full of ups and downs ive had numerous injuries so i have to say thanks to all the people who stand behind me
9260297 i didnt care what the conditions were going to be like what the course was
9260298 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving and out of new orleans right now
9260299 that would be one of the biggest mistakes that you could make in your life
9260300 byron will either be one of the best point guards in this league and one of the best in the country or it will be the toughest year of his life
9260301 people are angry because the rules for how things must be advertised are very unclear weve been pushing to get them tightened up to avoid exactly this kind of confusion
9260302 i really dont think men are supposed to be in here it scares the women away and besides i really wouldnt appreciate you staring at my bosoms bouncing up and down which they tend to do when i really get in the zone on this thing
9260303 in the first half we were not really up to speed and overall it was not a great game
9260304 the first two goals right at the start were both sloppy and it was only when we finally started playing our own game after the break that we did better
9260305 we know it is going to be tough in the next round although hillingdon are towards the bottom of our league whereas we are so far unbeaten
9260306 i would like to think we can win that one and maybe even go through from the next round as well as long as we play near our level because there will be teams from our division still in the competition at that stage
9260307 i know if we win you are the best and if you lose you are the stupid man i know this is the situation and it is my job if you cant take the pressure you cant be in this job
9260308 for me the pressure is normal and this is my job
9260309 no one is untouchable not the captain the vice captain no one
9260310 we had seven changes to the team from wednesday against israel so everybody has now played and its given me a chance to look at everyone very carefully on what they can do and what we need to be better at
9260311 its now down to me to pick a side for sunday based on what ive seen over the last two games
9260312 italy will be a different challenge for us they beat the israelis by 1 0 on wednesday just as we did on friday
9260313 england against italy at whatever level is always an interesting game and it will be very competitive so i dont suspect it will be any different on sunday afternoon
9260314 learning about plastics and the oceans and the damage it does to marine life ive taken it as my personal responsibility to get the word out
9260315 birds and sea mammals get entangled in the trash they eat the trash it goes out into the ocean and causes havoc there
9260316 that is going to have an impact on the entire community
9260317 seems like theres a lot more people out here than usual last time i dont think there was this many people
9260318 just like watching the kids in the parade and the different floats and everything
9260319 have batons twirl them thats the best part and candy
9260320 vorig jaar lagen we echt met twintig man te ronken in die bus je kon geen kant op het stonk en nu heb je met zijn twee n een eigen kajuit ik slaap met simon op een kamer dat is prima we hebben een eigen douche en een eigen badmeubel dat is wel stukken beter dan die vieze bus
9260321 we zien dit toch wel als een soort vakantie de dingen die we hier doen zijn leuke dingen ook de optredens dus daar word je niet moe van
9260322 het is wel een soort vakantie maar we zijn wel de hele dag bezig
9260323 je moet natuurlijk ook een programma maken maar we hebben voornamelijk lol we hebben gisteren gekart we gaan paintballen en heel veel varen natuurlijk ook
9260324 je wordt s ochtends gewekt door een camera en vervolgens word je gevolgd als je zit te ontbijten kijk de opnamen zijn wel spontaan maar er worden wel dingen ondernomen want als je op een strand blijft liggen tien dagen lang kun je geen tien afleveringen maken uiteindelijk ben je wel gewoon vijftien uur per dag aan het draaien
9260325 vooral nu we iets meer privacy hebben dan in de bus gaat het hartstikke goed
9260326 daarbij komt dat wij als harde kern de 3js jan smit en wij n grote vriendengroep zijn
9260327 we zitten elke avond tot in de late uurtjes met zijn allen op het dek gezellig aan het bier en dan hebben we verhalen te over dus wat dat betreft groeien we denk ik alleen maar dichter naar elkaar toe
9260328 het is zelfs een beetje zo dat onze vriendinnen het niet leuk vinden dat wij het zo leuk hebben met zn allen
9260329 maar ze kunnen niets zeggen want we gaan niet vreemd en er zijn geen andere meiden op de boot dus ze kunnen er niets van zeggen en dat knaagt natuurlijk helemaal
9260330 katrina was a learning experience for us so what were doing is trying to get as much resources as we can and pre position before anything hits landfall
9260331 ive seen the destruction ive seen the peoples needs and i know theres going to be a great need
9260332 the feeling when youre back and the feeling and the look on peoples faces that really need the help it makes it worth it its a really great feeling
9260333 right now in hattiesburg theyre not all that concerned but all of us are watching the weather channel and its any time now
9260334 differences over religion cannot be blamed for these crimes we are distressed at the defiance of law and order by hindu fundamentalist leaders and their public comments which are spreading lies and hate their unpardonable excuse is that followers are uncontrollably angry about christian conversions in the region
9260335 we are also deeply troubled by the state and central governments inadequate response the fact that identical attacks happened in the same area exactly nine months ago is unbelievable what will convince authorities to protect human rights and enforce constitutional guarantees
9260336 we apprised him of the situation and requested emergency deployment of the army compensation for the victims rebuilding of houses and churches construction of relief camps and restoration of the rule of law
9260337 le cose sono cominciate ad andare bene solo quando ha cominciato a
9260338 wabbit went home to be with her family they miss her
9260339 wabbit misses her too and thats why she comes to visit
9260340 this violence against the christian community these extremists are doing grave harm wrong to our christian brothers and sisters
9260341 and never the issue of religion comes up we are friends thats it the christians are normal ordinary people all human beings have a right to their own religion and beliefs
9260342 if the state government which is in alliance with the bjp cannot maintain law and order and save the lives and property of its citizens the central government should impose presidents rule and send the armed forces to stop the pogroms
9260343 killing is a heinous crime irrespective of who the victim or perpetrator is
9260344 why not lieberman ridge ect mccain is a sell out to the far right conservatives
9260345 she was just trying to protect her daughter from social embarrassment and here obama comes going out of his way to shame a 16 year old girl and her mother
9260346 then after palin successfully covers the pregnancy up she puts herself on the national stage under the scrutiny of a 1 000 reporters does this make any sense to you
9260347 it is a good thing that the kid did not come along
9260348 the edger the next big thing in online secular activism
9260349 kulturkritik und gesellschaft 1 p 303 the first time i saw iron and wine live was in st jacobs church in dachau in january 2008 in the extermination camp dachau the nazis detained 200 000 people and killed more than 40 000
9260350 enough is enough somebody who wants to live here must speak our language no immigration without taking german courses no rights without duties
9260351 families need help against the rise in prices a double amount of family allowance each sepember promised kept
9260352 sincerity openness fairness this would be a three way coalition for the next government
9260353 general elections in austria income distribution and corporate domination are neglected issues
9260354 its the end of the world as we know it
9260355 always hate first of all the place where you come from
9260356 this project was originally being prepared as part of our 2009 capital planning process but accelerating the work will assist our track maintenance staff in their efforts going into the fall and winter racing seasons
9260357 the base incorporating the inner racing paths is in solid condition but with removing the entire cushion we are provided the opportunity to firm up the outside portions of the base as well
9260358 we are building some time into the project to account for possible weather factors but feel confident the work can be done in a timely basis so the downtime affecting our horsemen and track related staff is held to a minimum
9260359 back in june we asked penn national to consider a major resurfacing project because the breakdowns were beyond what we thought was acceptable
9260360 they indicated that they would do major resurfacing in 2009 but it would have to be declared an emergency to do something in 2008 due to budget reasons
9260361 then in august the breakdowns became more frequent and we felt the level was completely unacceptable we just cant have horses continue to break down like this it is disrespectful to the horses and it puts the riders in danger
9260362 more recently penn national engaged the services of a racetrack expert to analyze the surface and a report was to be submitted with the findings of that study i have yet to see the findings
9260363 the racetrack is terrible right now to have that many breakdowns is shocking
9260364 we have fully reviewed the many successes and disappointments associated with the first generation of alternative racing surfaces and will continue to evaluate their long term potential for our multiple racing facilities
9260365 as that process evolves we will continue to employ the highest possible track maintenance procedures at our facilities
9260366 i dont like it going someplace you dont know people you dont know
9260367 and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9260368 the problem is there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9260369 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9260370 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9260371 this is a little more than what we had in mind in such a short time
9260372 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9260373 i dont think the hurricane will break them but i dont want someone breaking in
9260374 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9260375 if we dont get the wind and rain we stand ready to help them
9260376 if its like katrina they might not let us back
9260377 they might put a fence around the whole parish and say go away
9260378 i mean my house is not even finished and then what its going to float away again
9260379 i was hoping to get all the way right at least before another hurricane came and ate up my world
9260380 if i would have been in my house for a day it would have been ok then i could have dealt with it
9260381 i dont have a car i had to come with my neighbors
9260382 but i wasnt going to wait not after katrina these things can be killers we know it now youd have to be a fool not to get out while the gettings good
9260383 i was here three days in this house after katrina the water was over my head i floated out on an ice chest to get away
9260384 im not goin they arent gonna scare me or run me out im tired im too tired to go through it all again
9260385 we watched katrina from the cockpit of a 19 foot sailboat
9260386 thats what we do we rebuild thats the nature of mankind
9260387 katrina was hell there is a reason to have anxiety
9260388 from the veterinary perspective the equestrian olympics were a huge success and a great tribute to the many people who assisted in its complex organization
9260389 our entire animal rescue team has been put on standby to deploy at a moments notice if our assistance is needed
9260390 the humane society of the united states has deployed a core team of responders today to begin transporting our specially equipped disaster response vehicles and rescue boat to the gulf coast
9260391 many of our colleagues have reached out to assist us with our advance evacuation process and were very grateful to the hsus for providing additional transport vehicles and personnel who are in route to new orleans
9260392 these resources are critically needed given the number of animals that we anticipate evacuating in the next three days
9260393 it is crucial as this storm approached that residents in the path of gustav plan ahead for their safety and the safety of their animal companions
9260394 outbreaks of viral encephalitis in horses are a seasonal occurrence due to the prevalence of mosquitoes in late summer and early fall
9260395 horse owners should be aware of symptoms of viral encephalitis and consult their local veterinarian if a horse develops any of the signs associated with this group of diseases
9260396 definitive diagnosis is important in tracking the spread of eee and wnv infections
9260397 horse owners should work with their local veterinarian to verify test results through laboratory analysis
9260398 because there is no eee or wnv vaccine available for humans people should avoid mosquito bites by using epa registered insect repellents containing deet picaridin oil of lemon eucalyptus or ir3535 and by wearing clothes that cover the arms and legs
9260399 these preventative measures are especially important during the period from evening until morning when mosquitoes are most active or any other time mosquitoes become active
9260400 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9260401 it can take several days for the subsea wells typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly
9260402 but were also working with local authorities to provide fuel along evacuation routes
9260403 appropriate planning is under way to allow for the safe shut down of refinery operations and the evacuation of refinery personnel as circumstances warrant
9260404 but you know its always a possibility when youre a third string quarterback
9260405 it was a situation that i didnt really know what to expect
9260406 i did all that i could do i got a lot of reps i just know that i did all that i could
9260407 i think how the process works is that i will literally know in the next 24 hours when or not i will be with another team
9260408 i do have some good film from preseason so that helps
9260409 i had a little wheelie coming onto the front straight that probably cost me some time but ive still got to be happy well fine tune things a little bit more for the race tomorrow if i can get the holeshot at the start of the race i think i have a good shot at the win
9260410 im a little disappointed because i had such an awesome lap going
9260411 going into the esses i tried to let it roll a little more and got way off line and that messed things up all the way down to allans corner
9260412 but ive had such great feel with the front end all weekend and i didnt feel anything i braked earlier off the end of the backstraight and i wasnt trying to go at a break neck pace i think it would have been a pretty good lap
9260413 ive still got to do the same thing tomorrow and get a good start and get to the front
9260414 even though hanwell are a level below us in the pyramid they have started the season very well and this was a banana skin for us
9260415 they gave as good as they got but as soon as we scored the first goal i felt we were always going to win
9260416 however well be the underdogs in the next round when we play harlow who are now in the league above us
9260417 we used to play against them regularly so it will be nice to renew rivalries and we can go there without too much expectation
9260418 is eric bischoff going to start a new wrestling promotion using cmt as his network i dont know the answer but bischoff is an aggressive entrepreneur who understands the art of the deal being successful in this genre is all about talent and television and there unfortunately is no abundance of available talent out there that could headline a weekly tv show producing a slick looking show is less challenging than creating a viable talent roster in todays marketplace however i will add that if anyone could pull this off it would be bischoff
9260419 the brian kendrick has been really impressive as of late and i hope that his charisma and overall talent dont get checkmated by his lack of size
9260420 im not the forgiving type i guess murdering your own parents will do that to ya
9260421 not people like you r truth now thats the truth
9260422 hey thats one of my uncles five moves of doom
9260423 fine line between genius and insanity but if you know how to walk that line no one can stand in your way
9260424 watch your backs the spider could reappear anywhere and pris you have that gun for a reason protect gene
9260425 you peter parker poking piece of gutterspeak deleted for the kids
9260426 i love it this is awesome this is what we came here for
9260427 we just love riding over here and to get together with all the other bikes from around the world is just fantastic
9260428 i actually found this on ebay and i actually picked it up two nights ago at midnight
9260429 so you didnt have to hose anything down or anything
9260430 its everybody coming together like brothers and sisters riding for the same cause
9260431 and mickey gets cuter because walt disney makes more money that way
9260432 former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9260433 in picking an unknown untested half a term governor from alaska john mccain is following in a long line of reckless men who have rolled the dice for a beauty queen
9260434 just wait until she is debating joe biden and he starts attacking or condescending to her
9260435 it wont help with most hillary voters but it could help with some
9260436 if you are so concerned about the amount of experience of the vice president what about the top of your ticket
9260437 the ship will pay a working visit to sevastopol on september 1 the dallas will arrive in sevastopol from the georgian port of batumi
9260438 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan
9260439 we gotta get this shoveling done cant get the car out of the yard so im hoping we dont get anymore do you know anything i dont know
9260440 feel around for lumps bumps tenderness anything along these lines
9260441 there is a lot of responsibility a lot of demands its fast paced and thats what i liked
9260442 so the best bet is to get the baby out of you now
9260443 i noticed i wasnt happy at work i lost my will to do a lot of things that interest me like art and schoolwork i worked very hard during college i was very involved in clubs i noticed that my will to do things just diminished tremendously
9260444 patients with parkinsons disease lack a sufficient amount of dopamine this brain chemical allows us to produce smooth coordinated movements like moving your arm up and down
9260445 there is rigidity which makes it very difficult for the patient to move like theyre moving in a vat of tar there is a resting tremor that is characteristic in one arm or leg
9260446 patient and outreach services from rochester general hospital the women youre about to meet offer a very personal approach to the serious problem of being uninsured
9260447 maybe but when you make a detailed scrutiny of the present miseries of our bangsamoro brothers and sisters many are self inflicted by their backward and even archaic socio cultural system and their very feudal socio economic system systems that breed class exploitation and treats the concept of rule of law as something coming from mars
9260448 im 28 years old im working as hard as ive ever worked its either now or never im not going to pass up this great opportunity that comes once in a lifetime i want to take advantage of it
9260449 i was landing a lot of good body shots early in the fight and throughout the fight so i knew once i hurt him in the ninth it was just a matter of time
9260450 to go back to where i came from get that hunger back
9260451 he had some pressure coming into this fight because he changed trainers and when you change trainers you want to show people you made the right decision
9260452 i know i had to pass garcia before i could think about molitor but ive been waiting for this fight for a long time
9260453 wally was sort of an individual he certainly didnt go along with a lot of the stuff that the guys did
9260454 he was i dont want to say a loner because he could be quite charming and he got along good with everybody but if you done something that he really didnt like he would let you know about it especially if it would hurt the business he was very conscientious about wrestling
9260455 kowalski the meanest kindest human being youd ever want to meet he was as gaunt and lean as a southern preacher and a strict vegetarian it was a wonder how he maintained his weight of two hundred and eighty pounds on lettuce and carrots
9260456 he had a great body back then he was not a sophisticated wrestler but every promoter wanted him because he made a lot of money
9260457 killer kowalski when i first saw him i thought he was the most magnificent specimen of a human being id ever seen in my life
9260458 he was working out at the gym and was six feet six and about 280 pounds and he was ripped and just looked phenomenal you know back then they called him tarzan kowalski and he looked like tarzan should look like big and powerful
9260459 kowalski who has made quite a sweep of rivals and has become popular with the fans
9260460 he was such a good looking guy he 6 foot 8 weighed over 300 pounds and had long hair and looked like tarzan he looked real good at whatever he did
9260461 the women just loved him and the men hated him i heard about women fainting when killer kowalski came into the ring
9260462 just because i get over enthused about my work people hate me
9260463 everywhere i go they throw chairs newspapers cigar butts fruit and anything else they can grab i have been burned knifed blinded by pea shooters and hit over the head with boards
9260464 kowalski had a great school he spent a lot of time with us
9260465 anyone who knows me knows that i have always attributed walter with all of my success in pro wrestling
9260466 he took in a 20 year old kid who had traveled 3 000 miles from southern california and embraced him like a son he was kind enough to pass on his extensive and unique knowledge of this business to me from day one walter became my trainer and my friend he guided me through every step of pro wrestling but more importantly taught me how to be a genuine good person and to treat others with respect dignity and class i owe so much to walter that i could never put it all in words the time we spent together is and always will be some of the most precious memories i have and i will keep it in a special place in my heart
9260467 parlate della mafia parlatene alla radio in televisione sui giornali per parlatene
9260468 im very excited that daniel kerr will be a long servant of the west coast eagles
9260469 you can write that but odds are you wont because youll listen to some deep throat or something like that
9260470 ive had a very good discussion with daniel and really enjoyed talking to him about where were heading as a footy club its exciting its good
9260471 i didnt ask him for any guarantees and we probably wouldnt tell you if he did he might have actually it depends what you call a guarantee
9260472 it was all very positive very positive it would be fair to say that what you read in the papers is very inaccurate from what daniel says
9260473 the mri showed he has a pectoral tear and he will be operated on on monday afternoon and he will be out for between 18 and 22 weeks
9260474 from our point of view he will be back for the start of next season which is important for us but its sad for him and the new zealand test side
9260475 we just wanted to make some adjustments there we are using these games to work on our combinations of john sutton and craig wing and halfback chris sandow and isaac luke
9260476 i started the game with wingy at hooker which we havent done since hes been at the club and i thought it worked really well
9260477 we brought isaac off the bench a bit fresher it was just a bit of my having a look at the best combination going forward
9260478 we are using these games to learn a lot over the last few weeks we knew we werent going to be in the semi finals
9260479 but were playing the best teams in the competition and were not turning up and just going through the motions because were going out there and really ripping into them
9260480 i certainly thought our group responded bigtime from our performance against st kilda inside 50m entries were 57 so weve gone from 37 to 57 so hopefully that will continue
9260481 western bulldogs were a bit better than us early and until we adjusted to the wet conditions it looked like wed be in a bit of trouble but once we did that the fight of our playing group was just fantastic
9260482 both teams made a lot of mistakes which was expected in the wet and maybe just at crucial times they had a little more poise than we did at certain stages
9260483 it was the sort of game that was great for us going into the finals against a very competitive side and we certainly thought we held our own
9260484 for a while there there certainly was a chance of 59
9260485 we all get on streaks where you feel like things are going well and you try to ride it as long as possible
9260486 and i feel like ive been playing some good golf
9260487 its not the kind of buzz you want to play golf on trust me the kind of nonsense thats been in my head for a whole week is not the right kind of pressure
9260488 youve read it youve wrote it some of you might be guilty or not i dont know but boy what one hell of a week
9260489 although i had 59 in my mind once i made that putt it certainly didnt affect my golf
9260490 i hit a couple of bad tee shots coming in but i certainly felt i could hit a few good shots
9260491 its been a very long week and i think a lot of misspent energy has been taken up by obvious press media players everybody its just so mentally draining to be in this position to listen to read to hear all the b s this week im spent im exhausted i didnt want to finish the last two tournaments like this
9260492 do you know what im sick and tired of all this nonsense
9260493 im absolutely spent i cant waste any more energy on this if i get the call im ready to play and trust me ill do my job
9260494 id say right now im annoyed at not figuring out this golf course very well
9260495 its not the kind of buzz you want to play golf on trust me the kind of nonsense thats been in my head for a whole week is not the right kind of pressure its nonsense
9260496 youve read it youve wrote it some of you might be guilty or not i dont know but boy what one hell of a week
9260497 thats pressure thats what you thrive on to have to read all that nonsense listen to all that its totally different pressure ive performed in the big tournaments weve all seen what happens when you get batted for a week it happened earlier on in the year im tired of it
9260498 there is no way i will be truly ill be on the side by then
9260499 today we are proud to host patriot golf day events at more than 4 000 golf courses nationwide
9260500 and we are delighted to raise proceeds for the folds of honor foundation in support of the families of our nations bravest heroes
9260501 it is a true honor to pay tribute today to the people who not have only served us and made tremendous sacrifices but for those who as we speak are out on the front line in iraq and abroad
9260502 these events are very emotional to me after everything ive been through i am so grateful for what everyone is doing for the folds of honor foundation and my fellow veterans on patriot golf day nationwide when i was going through rehabilitation from losing a leg one of the things that kept me going were you my fellow americans who have supported me and the american military through it all it does make a difference
9260503 ed you didnt lose a leg you sacrificed a limb for freedom and the united states of america
9260504 thanks to heroes and i mean that only in the golf sense we are privileged to host patriot golf day at pga golf club for such a wonderful cause in the folds of honor foundation
9260505 two of my sons have served in the air force and from a mothers perspective it warms my heart that the pga of america and the folds of honor foundation are helping the families of those who have sacrificed for their country
9260506 we are excited to be hitting the road with motorhead and cracking skulls together american audiences have never witnessed destruction on this magnitude
9260507 when fans come to a misfits show they get a band who gets up there and gives them all theyve got
9260508 we give them the real thing thats how weve always done it at a show everyones just part of the band theres no them and us were all us
9260509 id packed everything humanly possible into the one day starting with breakfast
9260510 warhammer online ended up being the best game i saw at the show
9260511 it was an incredible day and one i wont forget soon
9260512 texas raised their energy level and changed their whole personality after we scored and we sat back on the lead
9260513 you just cant do that against this level of competition i didnt think our back four organized as well as they should have and we got punished
9260514 teach both you know dont be afraid of information healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both and you know i say this too as the daughter of a science teacher growing up with being so privileged and blessed to be given a lot of information on on both sides of the subject creationism and evolution its been a healthy foundation for me but dont be afraid of information and let kids debate both sides
9260515 did he think he could replace one vagina with another and get the same respect
9260516 did he think he could replace one vagina with another and get the same respect
9260517 brownie fema director michael brown youre doing a heck of a job
9260518 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
9260519 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured
9260520 the only thing i can say is our thoughts and prayers are with those who loved them
9260521 i was hoping they would not be found in the house we are having a service at the chapel tomorrow we are going to say some prayers for them and for the police and firefighters who are working there
9260522 we knew it was always an option but that has shocked me it has made me feel quite sick and sad its awful dreadful
9260523 its quite unbelievable this is maesbrook this sort of thing doesnt happen here
9260524 i dont think anyone will be shocked i think a lot of people thought they were in there but probably all three of them
9260525 i think we all think these sorts of things happen somewhere else but never to you but they do its a shame its a tragedy
9260526 whether it was mccain who used the song or if obama had chosen to use the song with the current political climate the lyrics still have the same meaning and we all need to do something to make a difference every action counts
9260527 oh ill just have little cake with my children and well probably watch cartoon
9260528 i am still looking forward to doing a lot of great things so thats hard i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
9260529 the recording of thriller and the off the wall album that meant very much to me and seemed to be received so beautifully by the public and the world you know i enjoyed it very much
9260530 some of the younger newer artists i think chris brown is doing wonderful and timberlake i really admire what they are doing
9260531 i am letting them enjoy their childhood as much as possible i really do i let them go to the arcade and go to the movies i think that comes naturally i want them to get to do things i didnt get to do
9260532 yes i get pretty emotional when i see them having a wonderful time when they are on a ride and they are screaming and they are happy and they are running it makes me emotional
9260533 were trying to get our assignments down and know what were doing
9260534 we had the crowd noise today during practice as we know its going to be a noisy place sunday at louisville there were a few mistakes but theres mistakes without noise too and we have to clear all of those up well have it again tomorrow and make sure were ready to play
9260535 we come in every day for breakfast at yankee kitchen but this morning we got a surprise fay kolis of canfield told tribune news partner 33 news after being surprised to find obama dining there
9260536 it was a really difficult day the build up to it was bad enough as we knew the anniversary was coming up but the actual day was very hard
9260537 everyone was thinking about what happened a year ago a lot of aarons friends had walked all the way from whitehouse to the cemetery carrying bunches of flowers and a lot of them dont have a lot of money
9260538 i was really pleased with the turn out we really appreciated everyone coming they all made the effort it is nice to know people are still thinking about aaron and the family
9260539 i cannot believe a year has passed we are all still hurting really badly we are no further forward with the inquest i know they have to get all the right information together but the process has got to be sped up it is not just our families that are waiting it is all the other families of the boys and girls who have been killed that are in limbo
9260540 this year were going out there to see how the first games prepare us for the sec because anyone who knows the southeastern conference in any sport knows its a grind day in and day out
9260541 the games are going to be difficult and we need to get these ladies prepared to play at that sort of level every time they step on the field
9260542 heading into the season the strength of our team is the defending side of the ball
9260543 the players with the most experience are our back four they have been together for over two years now which will work towards our advantage its so crucial in womens soccer that you have a solid goalkeeper and a good back line because it makes or breaks the game
9260544 sydney hiance gained a lot of experience because she was thrown into sec play as a freshman and that is a tough thing to handle i think she did a great job especially towards the end of the season
9260545 one of our major roles is to improve the health and wellbeing of the population
9260546 wherever possible we will encourage people to cut their risk of contracting preventable illness by taking steps such as maintaining a healthy weight
9260547 the care 3 peaks spain challenge is one of the most demanding events in the care challenge series over our series of 12 outdoor events this summer we hope to beat last years total of 1 2million and were extremely grateful to team shp for taking part we wish them the best of luck for the event
9260548 i believe we have added one of the best shooters in the nation to our squad
9260549 keyla is a winner and has a strong desire to play the game she is a complete basketball player and im thrilled about keyla joining our team
9260550 sarah is a player i have known for a long time and i have a lot of respect for her as a basketball player because she has great work ethic
9260551 she is hard nosed competitor who had a very successful career at rockcastle county i have watched her play a lot and she always showed up big in big games i am so excited she has chosen to be a part of our program
9260552 the work that the counter fraud team carry out has an important impact on all of us as tax payers and we were pleased to be able to congratulate the officer in question in this way
9260553 we were of course very happy with the successful outcome of the investigation which was as a direct result of the hard work of the team and their colleagues in the police force
9260554 oh no doubt no doubt no doubt technology should be introduced id like to have a look at that one again
9260555 talking to jason he believed he got kicked in the arm so i certainly would hate to be playing for a top four or top eight spot and have that cost us today it hasnt it mightve cost us the game and thats questionable
9260556 its something the afls got to look at whether its time keepers or whether its goal umpires things you can know that you can get right things you can control youve got to get right
9260557 bit of a hamstring problem it was a bit tight coming over and after a bit of a jog we thought it wasnt worth the risk
9260558 it was very intrusive so i went out onto the croft in my pyjamas i went out into town and got as far as the victory hall
9260559 i concluded it was an old air conditioning unit which had been left on overnight it could have been coming from one of the big offices but it was certainly a mechanical sound
9260560 i was walking down brandon lane when i heard the noise so i followed it
9260561 i wanted to get to the bottom of this i found it was coming from the scaffolding pipes on the tarantella hotel
9260562 you can only hear it when the wind blows and it is something like the sound when you blow across the top of a bottle
9260563 we need more concrete evidence and until we hear it and pinpoint it we have got nothing to go on
9260564 we have scoured half of sudbury and come up with nothing we have been there at different times and in different places with staff of different ages because that does affect hearing and we have not heard anything
9260565 different people have described different things but we are open to suggestions there are lots of theories
9260566 the wind can be an important factor but my suspicion is that the sound carries further on still days
9260567 we started off by trying to define what types of information we wanted to get we set about trying to get as much of that information about the wards as we could
9260568 the thing that its really going to be useful for is helping to explain why decisions are made as they are
9260569 when you look at ipswich we did see the emergence of two distinct areas youve got an area of the town where you get more professionals living and an area where there are low skilled occupations
9260570 detailed data such as this provides a fascinating insight into our town and is essential for planning the work that the one ipswich partnership does
9260571 there is lots of place for improvement on the triangle estate but its not an unhappy place to live
9260572 there are families who have never worked and thats part of the culture
9260573 i think we have glimpses of how things could be and thats encouraging
9260574 its an amazing place to be its a real privilege to work there weve had quite positive results
9260575 there were very few people until about the last year who were doing anything for the area
9260576 just write what you feel is correct dont think about how it will be made
9260577 she was taken ill at her house and wasnt able to travel to france for the concert
9260578 the plane made an emergency landing after a fault occurred
9260579 its one of those moments when you just want to sit back eat some popcorn and watch the show
9260580 they opened up some daylight and then quintavious did the rest running through tackles
9260581 they opened up a lot of holes and once i got through them im pretty hard to bring down
9260582 defensively we did a great job against a darn good offense
9260583 we had one big mistake on one play in the first half but everything else was outstanding
9260584 balatkayo lahat ang buhay sa mundo nakangiti kahit hindi totoo magandang bulaklak ang syang katulad mo ngunit paglapit koy walang bango
9260585 through the years our people have always been my inspiration in everything i do it was through music that ive learned how to love god our people and our country and my role as a public servant is the articulation of that song of love
9260586 on behalf of long live america foundation it is a privilege for me to receive this recognition and i share this honor with all filipinos around the globe
9260587 through the years america has shared its blessings of freedom and prosperity with the nations of the world as a thankful immigrant whose native philippines has been liberated by the united states in world war ii it is truly an honor to be of service to this great country
9260588 these are stories about my experiences with president ford president reagan president bush and with various governors across the country
9260589 i was shocked i was in a daze because id never seen anyone get shot before
9260590 anytime you have a situation like this in broad daylight on a beautiful saturday afternoon when people were out mowing their lawns and children are out playing its very disturbing
9260591 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9260592 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9260593 i heard it was going to be worse than hurricane katrina
9260594 were making a lot of progress on a lot of things that maybe not everyone sees
9260595 but if hurricane gustavs as bad as katrina were back to the start im definitely nervous
9260596 i dont really like to go home anymore it used to be id go visit this friend and this friend or that school or that family now your friends are gone your schools shut down its a different feeling
9260597 its weird to see a brand new store open up in a neighborhood where the houses are closed up and the lights dont work
9260598 it seems like anything that makes money does ok theyre definitely more concerned with rebuilding new buildings than working on the old ones
9260599 i think its so valuable but its not a required class
9260600 they must reconcile every single month before they move on and i check their balance throughout the month to make sure theyre not making the same mistake over and over
9260601 if theyre off by 5 cents you just cant have that you cant move on to the next month
9260602 you need to know that before you start writing checks
9260603 mistakes are made and unless you reconcile youre not going to catch the mistakes in your account and by reconciling you can avoid fines from bounced checks
9260604 i bring in a checkbook and then ill make copies of blank checks then ill make copies of withdrawal slips and deposit slips and we go over how to fill all those out how to keep track of them how to balance the actual checkbook
9260605 the ones that have a checking account have a little bit of a clue about reconciling but its like i said to the rest of them its kind of foreign
9260606 some of its even real artifacts from the civil war
9260607 we stay right here our patients sleep over there in the open
9260608 it had most of the technology of a nuclear attack sub except for the reactor navigation equipment and computers
9260609 all of that technology had to be reinvented after it went down
9260610 and its all right with me if we dont but well keep looking
9260611 the mud and silt were packed in so tight they didnt even move when we opened it up
9260612 it was just solid mud and we had to remove it ourselves you must fill out the comment body in order to submit a comment the comment you have entered is too long please limit your post to maxchars characters or less subscribe
9260613 it emanates from the same percentage of people who like high school algebra
9260614 really if you look at the people who do mathematics at all its probably roughly about the same people do not like math accounting keeping track of things its a very common behavioral item it really reflects within the management of their checking accounts too
9260615 while there are programs out there and most banks will provide that to help you reconcile its just like taking the garbage out
9260616 you just dont do it until the last minute and if you can get somebody else to do it great thats what it really comes down to its unfortunate
9260617 its important because you can think youve got 500 in your account and it could only be five dollars or it could really be a couple thousand dollars
9260618 we really dont know how many of out customers balance their check books
9260619 whatever that national statistic is if 87 sure in tiffin ohio more than 13 percent of people balance their check books it doesnt seem to be a real problem with our customers
9260620 there are people who every time they write a check or use a debit card if they have a transaction of 23 50 they write 24 because its just easier for them
9260621 over time that extra adds up to something and they dont even know its in there if you dont balance it
9260622 one of the things that has changed over the years is the technology with the ability to use internet and you have cell phone capabilities blackberries to go and check to see what your balance is
9260623 almost countering that has been the use of debit cards that has made the task of reconciling an account more difficult people forget to record a debit card transaction
9260624 when you combine all those we are roughly at the same percentage as we have been for many years roughly seven out of eight people dont reconcile their accounts the technology has aided it since they can get balances that used to be only the domain of the banker now they have the capability of getting that balance so they have some more information they can deal with and manage the account when it comes down to actually reconciling it and having a checkbook whether its electronic or paper theres really only one out of eight who do it
9260625 he was complaining to me about the bank branch manager who didnt know how he was reconciling his account
9260626 he did it every month it was giving him a hard time he said let me show you i had never asked him he had never shown me i learned how to reconcile an account on my own
9260627 my dad had this most convoluted way of reconciling an account he got to the right number when i did if for him in a more standard way we got the same number i said dad your approach is different than any ive ever seen done i can see why the branch manager is having a problem it turned out my dad had made an error and he was claiming that the bank had made an error
9260628 numbers ive seen in wealth management is that many more women will manage the overall household as far as investments so it just comes down that they will do that
9260629 men are less prone to do it i would definitely say that
9260630 they do reconcile but they often leave that to their cpa
9260631 i do i reconcile my personal account but i have had a cpa for 20 years she reconciles the business account monthly part of it is that there is an internal control there is a greater mandate to make sure things balance that things are in control
9260632 most bank statements have a form right on the back of them
9260633 if you take the banks balance and add and subtract those things it should match your check book
9260634 the town is growing and they definitely needed a facility especially with dipacifics closing
9260635 there are no buildings that can hold or public places that can hold more than 80 or 90 people and this will hold up to 95 so itll be a definite supplement and itll be well needed
9260636 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9260637 its important for the community because many people dont have health care and if you dont have health care insurance youre not able to seek health advice
9260638 we have ways here you can seek medical attention with low or no health insurance
9260639 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9260640 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9260641 just having that awareness i know it makes me think about where my energys coming from
9260642 its more sustainable to use wind energy because its a renewable resource the wind is not going to stop blowing whereas we can deplete our sources of coal or oil
9260643 as a university we want to do what we can to contribute to a more sustainable environment
9260644 its just a matter of making an agreement with rg amp e and theres some effect on the cost it does cost us a small amount more theres a slight surcharge for the wind energy
9260645 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9260646 many people had their own little stories to tell we give them information and invite them to the walk
9260647 were still looking for that last push of people to be captains
9260648 the one thing i always hear after every walk is i meant to do more
9260649 we put out labels so people can write the name of someone the walk is in memory of its not meant to be a fundraiser they just attach it to a flower
9260650 for where your treasure is there your heart will be also
9260651 oh they really needed to get into the word more
9260652 yes maybe but they really needed to learn it from gods perspective
9260653 there is no reason why joe public cannot do this save themselves a bit of money and help the environment because they are not using fossil fuels
9260654 so mother superior have you got a definite date for when the koreans are coming
9260655 as far as i know it should be the second week in september from what theyve told me theyre going to be arriving in istanbul this weekend she worked there for a while and has friends so theyre probably going to spend some time doing the rounds there and maybe some traveling around down south until then
9260656 my god ringo if youre going to emasculate yourself like a turk you might as well just say youre a liverpool fan
9260657 one has to work on ones friendships for them to flourish
9260658 so just curious if someone were to give you conclusive proof that the exodus never took place but that we jews instead just descended from a group of breakaway canaanite slaves that would be a deal breaker for you
9260659 my big problem is simple if it is not factual then why should anything after torah as nice as the intentions were be counted on
9260660 if genesis isnt factually true then that negates the whole thing without a six day creation there can be no cross
9260661 if its fake then our faith is in vain we are more than skunked you could say
9260662 do the stories of abraham have to be factual as well noach the seven day creation you have mentioned exodus several times but never the stories prior to them so im curious is you would be ok with them being fictional accounts or if you require all stories in torah to be factual
9260663 does wisdom require an event to literally happen in order to be wise
9260664 in may not be factual in the physical sense but completely accurate in the emotional psychological and spiritual sense its all about perception
9260665 what were seeing here in a reading like this is what rob bell calls
9260666 if someone were to give you conclusive proof that the exodus never took place
9260667 use of the term by scholars implies neither the truth nor the falseness of the narrative
9260668 in popular use a myth can also be a collectively held belief that has no basis in fact according to the speaker
9260669 you have to prove it didnt happen with incontrovertible proof
9260670 the mormons claim an extremely advance civilization formed in mesoamerica including coins roads etc
9260671 but a myth telling us a wise moral truth and being founded in nothing is comparable to a comic book
9260672 why cannot there be a middle ground on this issue not one side here and the other side there blocked by some brick wall of determinism
9260673 seeking truth is all about finding the best proof in my opinion
9260674 to me if a religion depends on the historical accuracy of a specific set of events having taken place the religion becomes contingent on something that might later be refuted by new findings or evidence
9260675 one of the fascinating aspects of study surrounding exodus is the change of methodology
9260676 if we want to believe exodus happened we will believe it we hold the standard of disproof so high that we are safe in assuming no one can reach it
9260677 since our last discussion did you ever narrow down a century in which you think exodus happened
9260678 how much would be sufficient for you to continue to consider the tanakh credible
9260679 exactly no point to the religion but great reasons for the truths behind the religions
9260680 one morning im out golfing alone and i come to a beautiful par 3 i hit my shot and watch as it descends towards the hole as it nears i realize its going to be close and sure enough it lands square in the hole
9260681 almost all stories that cant be verified have to be taken on faith or trust in the story i think someone said this earlier the problem is if your story is based on a tangible fact and that is proved to be wrong then you have cause for concern
9260682 a little voice in my head said that this guy may be on the road to de con land and lo and behold you made a similar comment
9260683 the strength of its teachings they are teachings of men i am a man also what makes these writers any wiser than my own search
9260684 yep you guys are wiser perhaps you could start your own wiser search and show their not is not as wise as yours 0 anon
9260685 paul bunyan in his trek toward the pacific ocean became tired when he dragged his axe he created the grand canyon
9260686 i come to a beautiful par 3 i hit my shot and watch as it descends towards the hole as it nears i realize its going to be close and sure enough it lands square in the hole
9260687 i did hit the pin this year and ended up 40 feet away and preceded to 4 putt
9260688 but there is no other claim outside the book of exodus of the ten plagues the jewish crossing of the reed sea the exodus or joshuas genocide
9260689 simply because the story of exodus mentions real places egypt jericho and real people hittites canaanites in an extremely broad sense does not make the story any more real
9260690 the defense lawyer has it easier all he or she has to do is create a reasonable doubt which is pretty simple in the case of the exodus account
9260691 we havent found a single solitary thing to support a consistent timeline of the exodus account but it is true because we hope to find some support in the future those silly they see there is not a single solitary thing to support their stories and all they are doing is hoping to find something in the future
9260692 the defense lawyer has it easier all he or she has to do is create a reasonable doubt which is pretty simple in the case of the exodus account
9260693 aliens told me by infrared rays you need to send me all you money
9260694 even though i want to believe this i understand my desire is not enough
9260695 are we discussing whether exodus was wisely written or truthfully written
9260696 weve found other hotels for those passengers who were unable to stay on in their accommodation
9260697 there were all these traffic jams because there were mobs rioting and stuff and to get out of there we walked for a kilometre and climbed the fence to get into the airport
9260698 on the way to the airport it was a bit scary to be honest and we panicked because weve never seen real shooting guns
9260699 the increase in the price of oil had added around 50 million us to our annual operating costs and we could not recover that from passengers who had already booked flights
9260700 but once it gets into a headline then it can become the law but you have to ride over that
9260701 when some of the media criticises and says that were not well known and so on you have to say why
9260702 unfortunately in these civil situations theres not a whole lot we can do unless we have indication theres a danger to the child or that something is amiss
9260703 we usually come every labor day weekend no matter who is racing

9260709 we reaffirm our commitment to protect iraqs natural resources as the patrimony of the people of iraq which should be used only for their benefit
9260710 it was there in what the greeks called mesopotamia that life as we know it today began there people first began to speculate on philosophy and religion developed concepts of international trade made ideas of beauty into tangible forms and above all developed the skill of writing
9260711 the heirs of a great civilization that contributes to all humanity
9260712 youd have to go back centuries to the mongol invasion of baghdad in 1258 to find looting on this scale
9260713 i thought i was given assurances that sites and museums would be protected
9260714 persuading the pentagon to relax legislation that protects iraqs heritage by prevention of sales abroad
9260715 merit securing as soon as possible to prevent further damage destruction and or pilferage of records and assets
9260716 coalition forces must secure these facilities in order to prevent looting and the resulting irreparable loss of cultural treasures
9260717 our troops who have been proudly guarding the oil ministry where no window is broken deliberately condoned these horrendous events

9260736 not the outward appearance of things but their inward significance

9260744 the ron paul people now are faced with a choice theyve got to look at the obama biden ticket and look at our ticket and decide who do they want to be leading our country who do they want to be deciding major issues that are important to the paul people
9260745 i think it would behoove our party for us to welcome them in and smooth over any rough feelings we have

9260757 we saw mark play against sydney in the pre season cup and he was exceptional
9260758 right now the people are relieved that the effects of the storm were not as bad as was expected in fact they are just relieved that its over i think because of the storms slow progress it moved at a speed of about six or seven miles per hour it seemed that it went on forever so people are glad to see the back of gustav
9260759 the students services and development manager had given us a directive to go home yesterday thursday evening but by that time it was too late to leave gustav hit at about 6 pm on thursday and the rains continued until after lunch today yesterday

9260770 i am someone who is concerned about the quality and diversity of our media market
9260771 theres never been an industrial dispute in this country that wasnt solved by talking
9260772 barry ofarrell has suddenly pulled out of his back pocket an energy efficiency plan to justify his actions last week to justify actions that were very politically based and he knows it
9260773 our job now is to move ahead and to deal with the political decision making of barry ofarrell last week and implement a mini budget that still meets labors core commitment to our constituents
9260774 the proposed rail development does not run through the byfield national park as stated by some sections
9260775 it runs through commonwealth defence land thats been purchased and used extensively for defence training and military manoeuvres since 1967
9260776 approximately 50 per cent of the proposed rail line route is already cleared buffer zone for the defence force
9260777 we acknowledge that there are environmental impacts which will need to be examined thoroughly by authorities and by the community
9260778 thats precisely why significant projects of this type undertake comprehensive environmental impact studies required under both state and federal legislation as part of their approval process
9260779 im on the public record frequently saying how saddened i was for dr hollingworth and his wife
9260780 the issues of course were complex things happened it was a very difficult time
9260781 i feel comfortable in my own skin that the ship of state is on course and people are very nice to us wherever we go
9260782 i suspect that about 350 400 000 of those are already integrated satisfactorily into the country
9260783 integrated to such an extent that you dont hear about them theyre doing what we would look upon as normal jobs living normal australian lives
9260784 it will be backed by a 100 million funding program over three years for economic and social infrastructure in regional and rural communities in key mining areas

9260786 qrc and its members have lobbied strongly to ensure that the needs of communities in regions such as the bowen and surat basins and north west queensland are recognised and rewarded through tangible returns such as improved community services
9260787 i think we can all think of pockets of disadvantage in major cities and in regional centres and theyre the kind of areas we want to assist
9260788 were absolutely focused on making sure every school in this country is a great school
9260789 joel kleins model has made a difference to those pockets of poverty and disadvantage
9260790 i would relish the opportunity each and every day and im sure treasurer wayne swan would relish it too
9260791 there are some very clear facts about mr costellos track record which im sure we would be pointing out
9260792 i hope he doesnt leave the parliament and i hope hes available for higher duty
9260793 i think brendan nelson is doing a terrific job under difficult circumstances
9260794 the question marks that are now very much hanging over the rudd government are due in large measure to brendan nelsons tenacity and political savvy
9260795 our success has been driven by the passion intellect and work ethic of our faculty staff and students
9260796 from success in competing for research grants to commitment to extraordinary teaching and patient care theyve made our school remarkable
9260797 the significance of this victory must not be lost in a maelstrom of self pity nor collective remorse after all too much anguish pain and suffering have been experienced by the entire nation and more particularly the families at lusignan bartica and lindo creek as a result of the bloody handiwork of rondell rawlins and his notorious gang members
9260798 the joint services state security and intelligence bodies have waged a dogged and relentless battle to hunt down and bring to justice these criminals
9260799 they nevertheless weathered the storm and in the end triumphed their efforts have not been in vain rondell rawlins and jermaine charles are now history however the ongoing challenge to dismantle the criminal enterprise and to ferret out the remnants of the gang continues to be top priority
9260800 the ministry of home affairs supports the call by the commissioner of police for all other criminals wanted by the police to surrender themselves into the hands of the police refusal to do so could perhaps result in them suffering a similar fate as rawlins and charles the release said
9260801 1 where only one union has applied under section 18 the board shall carry out a membership survey to determine the extent of support which the union enjoys on the date of the application among the workers comprised in the appropriate bargaining unit
9260802 2 where it appears to the board from the results of the survey that the union is supported on the date of application by at least forty per cent of the workers comprised in the appropriate bargaining unit the board shall certify the union as the recognized majority union for that unit
9260803 3 in carrying out any membership survey under this act the board shall satisfy itself by whatever means it deems appropriate as to the authenticity of any documents submitted
9260804 that certainly answers my call for my caucus to consider moving on and allowing new blood in
9260805 but because of budgeting we had to leave some behind
9260806 we just had to bring a big contingent it is guyana our neighbour and we wanted to put on a good show for our neighbour
9260807 that was our biggest contingent ever and this is our second biggest we have never taken any such large contingent to other celebrations
9260808 it would be like one large cultural mosaic will be presented
9260809 there would be many different dances and music styles from the african people from the indian people from the east indian people from the indigenous people from the indonesian people from all the ethnic groups
9260810 during this celebration of diversity in unity we personalise our country mother suriname our mothers womb symbolically exposed by the woman as an exponent of life and our culture
9260811 literally and figuratively and created a bond that will last forever
9260812 but we enjoyed guyana we love the people and the people love us
9260813 the presence and influence of brazil is visible on the stages
9260814 escaped from the court area and went to the home of the deceased khan where he shot her in her head and chest he then shot himself in his right temple
9260815 we struggle very hard to remove one cockroach from power and the next rat comes to do the same thing
9260816 i think republicans are more accustomed to following the rules
9260817 were used to sitting in the cheap seats weve got binoculars
9260818 were very pleased that south carolinas role in presidential politics is secured one more time
9260819 the republican solution to californias budget crisis continues to be to just say no and walk away from the table without an alternative proposal even when both assembly and senate democrats have bent over backwards with compromises being in the minority is not an excuse for being irresponsible the time for republicans to come clean with their plan to bridge our 15 billion budget gap is now and the time for the governor to engage with his own party to get the votes needed is long overdue
9260820 most of americas major unsolved challenges revolve around these 14 questions to move america forward the next president needs a substantive plan for tackling them going in and voters deserve to know what that plan is

9260822 ensuring that the u s continues to lead the world in science and technology will be a central priority for my administration
9260823 our talent for innovation is still the envy of the world but we face unprecedented challenges that demand new approaches
9260824 we are grateful for senator obamas detailed responses and look forward to receiving the same from senator mccain
9260825 after that we hope the candidates will want to discuss their differences science debate 2008 and its partners once again extend an invitation to both candidates to attend a televised debate or forum where these vital issues can be discussed in front of a broader audience
9260826 todays decision means that california can get back to enforcing indispensable clean water standards that protect people from getting sick at local beaches and wildlife from toxicity in local waterways these standards protect drinking water supplies people at the beach and fish in our rivers so this is great news for everyone in southern california
9260827 although we respectfully disagree with the courts ruling that the water board violated the law heal the bay is ecstatic with the decision yesterday which restores the water quality standards that we need to protect public health and aquatic life from storm water pollution
9260828 we welcome this decision and call on the building groups and anti environmental coalition of cities who filed this case to stop spending public money to make local waters dirtier this case is an attempt to hold the interests of the public at large hostage to the anti regulatory politics of the few and its a shameful perversion of sound public policy
9260829 the university of california applauds the legislatures passage of this legislation which provides new tools to law enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of crimes against academic researchers and their families
9260830 the legislature led by assemblymember mullin has taken an important step in supporting university research that aims to enhance the health and well being of people throughout california and around the world
9260831 the hubbard act honors the sacrifice of brave americans who have served their country honorably in the face of tremendous personal tragedy
9260832 im pleased that the president has signed it into law putting an end to a policy that was unfair and deeply flawed finally americas sole survivors will get the benefits they deserve
9260833 our military men and women and their families have made sacrifices on behalf of our freedom and democracy
9260834 when these families experience tragedy and loss their situation should not be made more difficult as a result of poorly constructed policies and procedures im pleased the president has signed the hubbard act into law which will ensure sole survivors are not penalized when they separate from the military and that the benefits and pay to which they are entitled are consistent with personnel who are involuntarily separated under honorable conditions
9260835 today is a great day for all of the sole survivors in our nation as this bill rights a wrong for our brave men and women in uniform
9260836 i am also pleased that president bush signed this bill into law with jason hubbards family in attendance

9260841 i have already talked with bob arum and he told me that oscar has agreed that the penalty will be 3 million for every pound or a fraction thereof in excess of 147 lbs during the weighin
9260842 oscar is the bigger boxer is taller at 5 10 as to pacquiao who is 5 6 and has the reach advantage
9260843 well i think first of all a lot of people are going to be very surprised when were standing next to each other size really isnt going to be that much of a big difference its not going to be like roy jones against john ruiz with the size differential
9260844 i also have to keep in mind that manny pacquiao is a southpaw so in the past the southpaw fighters that i have fought i really havent done very well with so this is not going to be an easy fight i have no intentions of taking it easy in the gym i have no intentions of looking for this fight to be easy
9260845 de la hoya to pay 3 million for every pound over 147
9260846 it could be about a kid from a small town who dreams of being a rock star and he wins the guitar hero competition one of these dreams come true kind of concepts

9260852 they introduced that system here and have been maintianing it ever since
9260853 bourbonese qualk is by far one of the most under appreciated

9260856 he said the two male africans were identified by two prison officers as wanted men rondell rawlins called fineman and jermaine charles called skinny
9260857 on descending upon the scene they the ranks found the body of a male african lying on the ground he was picked up and rushed to the georgetown public hospital corporation where he was pronounced dead on arrival greene told reporters
9260858 yes i am satisfied given the time that we had to make that preparation
9260859 would have said that they saw what happens on soiree
9260860 i am satisfied taking into consideration the short space of time although we would have liked to have had a pure african show
9260861 report fingers two gdf officers from the military investigation department a lieutenant and a captain both of whom are well known to be responsive to instructions from the office of the president
9260862 is culpable for allowing this unsavoury practice to take root in the security forces
9260863 the refusal of the jagdeo administration to root out torture as a practice among elements of its security forces borders on the criminal and will have far reaching consequences for the future of this country
9260864 people are coming in from all over the country for this thats how much the rink means to all of us
9260865 i think a lot of people are going to miss it
9260866 it is sad a bit dilapidated and its not the nicest ice rink surface but i like it
9260867 apparently this whole area here is going to be a swimming training center or at least thats what were hearing
9260868 i know that its not the best rink in the world its old but theres so many memories here
9260869 this is the first place ive ever skated and to know that its going to close and that im never going to be able to come here its hard
9260870 i cant walk to the post office ive got 90 minutes of mobility a day id have to take a cab to the post office and wait for it pay the meter when its running and then get the cab back
9260871 for the most part i pay everything online the few things i do mail i send actually from work so the mailbox doesnt really affect me
9260872 any postal carrier will be happy to take mail so you can hand it to your carrier you can put it in your mailbox and when they deliver your mail that day theyll pick it up
9260873 most people if they have checks going out yes its a problem
9260874 if someone picks it out of their mailbox and it doesnt get to the destination and think of the trouble that causes
9260875 some of us older and younger people dont own computers
9260876 everything i do is public i try to keep something for my private life
9260877 yet in your brochures all i have is your cv
9260878 its always a compromise what you do in a brochure
9260879 you talk a little bit about yourself you talk about the broad strokes of your program
9260880 i asked about the riding and to leave aside the position papers
9260881 on your web site we can see mr beryl wajsman who was part of that banned list contributed to your campaign
9260882 why are people who are banned from the liberal party of canada involved in your campaign
9260883 mr beryl wajsman is perfectly entitled as a canadian citizen to make a donation to any party this is certainly within the law and this is a democracy that we live in and he decided to contribute to my campaign and i see no problem with that
9260884 i think the conservative government tried to slip in the rights of the fetus into the back door of this bill i think its very disturbing as a feminist who is pro choice as are the majority of quebecers im very opposed to this measure and i would say that its unfortunately also that a number of liberal mps voted in favour of this legislation
9260885 were going to sell you the stuff that makes you sick and then were going to sell you stuff that makes you better

9260891 an earlier estimate of poverty of 985 million living below the former international poverty line of us 1 a day in 2004 down from 1 5 billion in 1981 was based on 1993 cost of living data which was the best available at the time
9260892 the new poverty numbers which show that 400 million more people lived below the poverty line in 2005 than earlier thought are benchmarked to the revised international poverty line of us 1 25 a day in 2005 prices this line is a good standard for assessing extreme poverty because it is the average of the national poverty lines for the worlds poorest 10 to 20 countries

9260918 what you tend to find with the web design market is that the large agencies stay away from small business owners who simply cannot meet their budget requirements those web design firms that do take on small businesses tend to offer poor quality websites based on templates which can often harm your reputation online and frankly dont represent good value for money
9260919 at design oven weve taken the quality of a top end agency and combined that with affordable prices that meet the needs of small and medium sized business owners all our designs are unique and our prices are more than competitive a real first for web design

9260925 since the latest gambling legislation was introduced the industry in the uk has seen a dramatic rise in value and traffic online casinos based in the uk are performing well and the competition between them is hotting up resulting in better offers and sign up bonuses for customers
9260926 with broadband internet access becoming almost universally available over the last few years online gambling in the uk has enjoyed steady growth and we predict this will continue for the foreseeable future the only difficulty now for consumers lies in choosing the best online casinos and finding the best welcome bonuses available

9260928 by law developers must dedicate cash or land to school districts due to student growth and impact
9260929 there was no mitigation assigned to the district and we had to oppose this plan
9260930 if lagae is developed where are the children going to go to school
9260931 my childrens school will be overcrowded if the answer is buffalo ridge is that responsible growth
9260932 the members of the city council had much to study review and listen to before casting their vote
9260933 i could not have been more proud of the seriousness and dedication they brought to this process and these proceedings
9260934 if a developer gives land to a charter school in douglas county why dont they get credit for it with the school district
9260935 as a taxpayer i am trying to understand the economics of building a school that my taxes do not pay for and i dont understand why that doesnt count for something
9260936 go back to buffalo ridge or timber trail if the school did not get a facility by august 2009
9260937 american academy is not a private corporation we are a public school
9260938 this is one building that local taxpayers do not have to pay for and our new home will allow 750 children seats in this community
9260939 so if the developer gives you 1 1 million in lieu of land how much of that money will remain in cpn and will it be used to build a new school can you not utilize your current location in cpn and build a school
9260940 there are not roads to it yet and we dont know how long it would be before the developer would have that done
9260941 do the school districts calculations consider the adverse tax impacts to the city of cpn and to the cpn metro district if mitigation is required the two entities have a combined mill levy of 47 5 mills property tax revenues are very important for funding renewable water and running this city
9260942 the loss of tax revenues to the city is important
9260943 if you do the calculation you may find that the school district owes the city money
9260944 with all due respect to the school district we are not aware of any such law under the law that governs the city there is no requirement for the city to exact from a developer a land dedication or cash payment in lieu of a land dedication
9260945 i dont have a child at american academy but one principal reason we incorporated was to see lagae ranch developed to allow 22 million in tap fees to give us a better opportunity to obtain renewable water
9260946 i urge the council to take a chance to complete our new city and control our own destiny
9260947 we incorporated last year to become a city for decisions such as this to determine our own future to chart our own course to have our city reflect the vision of its citizens
9260948 and while not every decision we make will be agreed upon by all we are committed to always finding the common ground that allows us to work together for the good of our city
9260949 what we witnessed wednesday was the city council comprised of citizen volunteers who pored over every aspect of this issue listened to every citizen comment and remained steadfast in our determination to do what was right for the entire city of castle pines north

9260958 i know that people will talk and i cannot stop that but god knows that i tried my best and i never encouraged him with nonsense and nothing in my house was given to me by him because i work hard for what i want

9260965 were excited about the new merger and we want illinois car shoppers to be just as excited this new platform gives us the opportunity to offer great savings and more selection to car shoppers
9260966 it was a pure fluke against protocol and policy that brought these two wonderful animals together
9260967 we were at the pet fair we took both cats but not enough cages we decided they would both have to co op a rolling kennel and that way if they didnt like each other they would have the opportunity get away from one another
9260968 instead it was a show in itself they were so fascinated with each other they could have cared less about the pet fair we decided since they were already exposed to one another we would just leave them together at the shelter it has been a delight to watch these two cats groom play and cuddle with each other they act like they have been together forever
9260969 we here at the shelter would love to see possum and socks placed together because of the bond theyve formed here at the shelter possum is a special needs kitty with certain allergies either from food or environment that gets better and worse at different times being with socks possums condition has been at best we here feel that since he has been with her he has a sense of comfort
9260970 we want to save them all but once they carve a little piece out of your heart it becomes history we dont forget these kinds of animals our jobs are so difficult everyday we need these creatures to give us hope and to instill in our hearts why we do this to watch these two daily especially after we went against our written rules we desperately want to keep them together we truly feel without socks possum would have never made it at the shelter
9260971 i think they are special because theyre a symbol for all the homeless cats that have passed through our doors that even though theyve arrived here in a strange loud stressful environment theyve still found happiness with each other that gives the other cats employees and anyone that comes across possum and socks hope that one day there will be a home for every homeless pet

9260987 this community is really really great it really moves me especially all the women that are calling we cant imagine what its like to lose a baby
9260988 theyre learning about their culture and the importance of this wonderful culture
9260989 these kids are born in america but still you know theres west indies
9260990 so they mustnt forget their heritage you know they must learn both sides of the fence
9260991 the board believes that the 32red brand identity and its values have the potential to establish a stronger presence in territories outside of the united kingdom
9260992 fortunate to be married to a man who earns nearly 20 000 rupees approx us 266 a month as a draughtsman

9260994 ramadan is approaching in a few days everyone expects a generous feast at sehri the pre dawn meal that starts the fast and at iftar when the fast ends at sunset and i just do not know how to manage
9260995 consumption increases in most households during ramadan everyone spends more
9260996 many buy almost double the usual amount of rice and flour
9260997 sometimes even at the sunday bazaars set up by the government to provide items at controlled rates to people you have to stand for hours to buy a single 20kg bag of flour
9260998 atta wheat flour will be sold at a fixed price of rs 300 about 4 per 20kg bag in ramadan
9260999 lift the illegal ban on inter provincial movement of wheat
9261000 we usually do a roaring business in ramadan but now we are suffering losses because few can afford to buy one roti at rs 7 about nine us cents a piece it cost only rs 5 6 5 us cents a few months ago
9261001 no one is doing anything for us and we fear the time may come when we must remove our children from school if we are to eat
9261002 the nuba mountains region is a microcosm of the tensions surrounding cpa implementation many local residents feel ignored with good reason by the international community and neglected by the un system
9261003 growing ethnic insecurity in the region has the potential to deteriorate significantly over the coming months and needs urgent attention to prevent it from spiralling out of control
9261004 with the sole exception of abyei kordofan suffers an attention deficit
9261005 the dangers of renewed violent conflict and humanitarian crisis in kordofan have been evident ever since the signing of the cpa
9261006 rather than socio economic integration and political reconciliation lubricated by a development efforts and a peace dividend south kordofan is the locus of an armed standoff with many fearing a return to war
9261007 the potential for armed group activity is fuelled by the large numbers of ex combatants the near absence of a comprehensive reintegration programme since organised hostilities ended in 2005
9261008 without the required co location in training centres the former enemies have separate chains of command training armaments and barracks administration of government and splm controlled areas remains separate two local government systems currently operate in parallel with separate policies for education two languages two systems judicial and security systems and local government structures passing from one area to the other involves passing through armed checkpoints
9261009 if you look at the new developments in the area there is a very big gap between what the report is saying and what is also taking place
9261010 i dont think the reports findings have become invalid but there has been a very big breakthrough in terms of integration of separate administrations and police forces
9261011 i would be the last person to say there are no problems in south kordofan that would be nonsense
9261012 but i think this is a huge step forward and i am amazed that there is hardly any attention for this fact i dont think war will be as inevitable as people have been saying
9261013 unmis has done little to calm tensions in contrast to the active efforts of the much smaller number of unarmed ceasefire monitors the joint military commission jmc which were present from 2002
9261014 i dont think that unmis has been weak or has failed in implementing its part of ddr
9261015 there are a lot of preparatory things we had to have in place before we could start
9261016 it would have been a disaster all these prerequisites have now been met and that is why we are moving towards a pilot project
9261017 a combination of weak political will an international community distracted by darfur and unmiss underperformance has led to the failure of cpa implementation in south kordofan many now view war in the nuba mountains as inevitable
9261018 with wfp stocks already in place our partners on the ground have been able to begin distributing food to some of the affected families
9261019 many people in these areas of southern haiti already suffer from malnutrition or micronutrient deficiencies and cannot afford this kind of upheaval
9261020 whenever a natural disaster such as gustav hits the region the consequences of its impact are amplified
9261021 if schools are seriously damaged or used as temporary shelter this could seriously delay childrens return to school which is due in about a week
9261022 the good part of what has happened is that one of the factions at least seems capable of developing a government in kabul
9261023 we gave them the details on the proposed pipelines we also talked to them about the projectsbenefits such as the transit fees that would be paid
9261024 and we reinforced our position the project could not move forward until they stabilized their country and obtained political recognition from the us and the international community
9261025 the need for multiple pipeline routes for central asian oil and gas resources
9261026 it will give aid to afghan warlords once they agree to form a council to supervise the project
9261027 if these central asian countries want a big us company involved amoco is far bigger than unocal
9261028 when the americans had secretly and through the pakistanis specifically the isi supported the talibans assumption of power
9261029 coincidentally president bushs special envoy to kabul zalmay khalizad had also worked for unocal
9261030 reconstruction in afghanistan was going to open up a whole range of opportunities

9261037 this deliberate devaluation of the currency of a country by currency traders purely for profit is a serious denial of the rights of independent nations
9261038 you want to encourage people to use the buses and trains but when theyre parking on the streets like this it really poses an inconvenience to the local residents and the businesses
9261039 each town is acting out of their own selfish interests they are just trying to protect themselves
9261040 one of the ways that we believe we can build ridership is to improve access to parking
9261041 everyone who used to park in wood ridge and east rutherford started to come to carlstadt
9261042 we had no choice but to initiate an ordinance like that
9261043 you want to encourage people to use the buses and trains but when theyre parking on the streets like this it really poses an inconvenience to the local residents and the businesses

9261047 we had no choice but to initiate an ordinance like that
9261048 the developing world is poorer than we thought but no less successful in the fight against poverty
9261049 the new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurement because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries
9261050 data from household surveys have also improved in terms of country coverage data access and timeliness
9261051 the new data confirm that the world will likely reach the first millennium development goal of halving the 1990 level of poverty by 2015 and that poverty has fallen by about one percentage point a year since 1981
9261052 however the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
9261053 senator mccains choice for a running mate is beyond belief by choosing sarah palin mccain has clearly made a decision to continue the bush legacy of destructive environmental policies
9261054 sarah palin whose husband works for bp has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment
9261055 this is senator mccains first significant choice in building his executive team and its a bad one it has to raise serious doubts in the minds of voters about john mccains commitment to conservation to addressing the impacts of global warming and to ensuring our country ends its dependency on oil
9261056 these bowl shaped depressions reflect the former location of relatively pure glacier ice
9261057 this late stage snow could accumulate in depressions on the crater wall and in favorable microclimate settings melt to produce the observed gullies and fans
9261058 are exciting because they establish a spatial link between recent gullies and accumulation of glacier ice strengthening the case for surface melt water flow in the formation of gullies on mars
9261059 and superior in that the offensive smell of infusions was eliminated
9261060 as they capture mosquitoes that have had a blood meal and thus more opportunity to become infected
9261061 each female mosquito has the potential to produce about 200 eggs and she can have as many as five cycles so when we capture a gravid mosquito that can remove as many as 500 females
9261062 sampling the species in urban environments has been a challenge until studies on its oviposition cues allowed the development of gravid female traps that collect mostly females that previously have blood fed and therefore had a chance to become infected

9261065 this is a once in a lifetime experience you dont get to shake the hands of the next president of the united states and the next vice president every day

9261067 im real excited its a real defining moment in our nations history these conventions are the super bowl of politics ill enjoy being a part of it all the plotting and planning and ill be anxious to get back and kick off our local campaign
9261068 this pointless import only serves to increase criticism of japan
9261069 the whale meat should be returned to its senders at their own expense
9261070 whales as living organisms at the top of the marine ecosystem are extremely important for protecting the ocean environment and we should therefore pay close attention to how they are treated
9261071 the fisheries agency also needs to strive in future to protect the marine ecosystem by revising its own lethal research programme which has led to the deaths of almost 8 700 whales in whale sanctuaries across the southern oceans and move on to non lethal means of conducting research on whales
9261072 we are impressed by and proud to be involved with the gulf region kidney communitys advance readiness to ensure that its kidney patients will be well cared for during this potential weather crisis
9261073 because thrice weekly dialysis treatments can never stop for esrd patients a high level of coordination among physicians providers patients caregivers and other volunteers like that seen here in louisiana to provide continuous high quality care is critical
9261074 while we hope that our services arent needed we are ready willing and able to assist ifaw in helping animals and their owners should disaster strike
9261075 in situations like this we can only prepare for the worst and hope for the best we are happy to respond to the request for help from the state veterinarian of louisiana and plan to aid the state and its animal victims as swiftly and efficiently as possible
9261076 having spent two months in new orleans in the aftermath of hurricane katrina our organizations responders have the compassion technical skill and strength to nurture and protect vulnerable animals even under the most trying of circumstances
9261077 surface water irrigation efficiency ranges between 25 and 40 percent in india mexico pakistan the philippines and thailand between 40 and 45 percent in malaysia and morocco and between 50 and 60 percent in israel japan and taiwan
9261078 our entire animal rescue team has been put on standby to deploy at a moments notice if our assistance is needed
9261079 the humane society of the united states has deployed a core team of responders today to begin transporting our specially equipped disaster response vehicles and rescue boat to the gulf coast
9261080 many of our colleagues have reached out to assist us with our advance evacuation process and were very grateful to the hsus for providing additional transport vehicles and personnel who are in route to new orleans
9261081 these resources are critically needed given the number of animals that we anticipate evacuating in the next three days
9261082 it is crucial as this storm approached that residents in the path of gustav plan ahead for their safety and the safety of their animal companions
9261083 history has shown that when the business environment gets harder the incidence of arson rises whether at the hands of desperate business owners or former employees
9261084 many successful businesses can also find themselves affected by attacks on nearby premises whether by the fire or by efforts to put it out resulting in water damage
9261085 each business is different and it is no good having off the shelf protection and being under prepared it is vital businesses have the right cover such as business interruption insurance
9261086 there should be several competent people with employers ensuring there is always at least one in the workplace
9261087 with so much at stake not to mention the moral duty of care this is an issue employers simply cant afford to ignore
9261088 every bridge all the way from scotland had people on waving scottish flags and cheering it got a much bigger response than anyone was expecting
9261089 it was quite an emotional event for people involved colin was the kind of character people admired he was a very personable and down to earth and was taken away before his time
9261090 a lot of people staying in the uk want something a bit different but they dont want to travel abroad pricewise
9261091 edinburgh is still quite accessible from england and they see that as going abroad without the hassle of going abroad
9261092 weve had 3 000 people through on stag nights this year and in the whole of 2007 we only had 1 000 in total the main growth has been around edinburgh
9261093 they have all come from england because they are coming up for a weekend break the flights abroad are all going up in price and there is uncertainty but we dont suffer the recession so badly because guys still want to celebrate their stag party
9261094 we have seen a massive trend towards last minute bookings
9261095 we get three or four bookings a week for the weekend mainly from locals people feel they cant afford to go away but when it comes to it they want to celebrate
9261096 it does add to the citys income but there is a risk that it deters people looking for a quieter break
9261097 its not very pleasant to be confronted by raucous drunks and we would like to see the licensed trade keeping these things within decorum and keeping our streets safe for everybody im not saying they are wild criminals but it can be intimidating for other people
9261098 there doesnt seem to be any need to encourage more of this business we have enough now and its not something we are seeking more of
9261099 many children are happy making some money from selling the animals to the markets but they keep some for their family
9261100 im a strong believer i think she must have had a guardian angel im so happy
9261101 worked hard connecting the community and police and has engaged the police force in providing a higher standard of law enforcement he is prepared to let the community determine if he is in fact suitable for the position
9261102 we have to check out every application very carefully people are up to all sorts of tricks they know that every place is checked out houses are visited and we find out if they really are on the lists for council tax but they still try to cheat the system there has been an increase in fraud this year and the staff have never been so busy
9261103 parents sometimes get angry but we say we will hand it over to the police and generally they just want us to drop the case
9261104 it may seem crazy but i understand why parents do it they want the best education for their children
9261105 ministers should improve the quality across the board to stop this happening
9261106 everybody and his grandmother told me my premiums wouldnt go up if i pleaded guilty to this offense

9261110 we have lost shrubs trees and plenty of plants on the promenade they have been irreversibly damaged by the salt coming from the waterfall
9261111 superman batman and spiderman represent a 20th century type of folklore much like their predecessors odysseus hercules and perseus
9261112 with less than three months until election day hunters and anglers are still up for grabs and its clear they are concerned about global warming and americas energy future
9261113 gun rights are important but conservation is just as important
9261114 candidates should take note conservation climate and energy are issues sportsmen expect the next president and congress to tackle immediately
9261115 hunters and anglers who care about conservation are looking for the candidate with the boldest clean energy plan
9261116 the technology solutions that help families reduce their dependency on fossil fuels are the same technologies that will also solve the climate crisis clean the air and help protect americas natural resources for our childrens future
9261117 we can improve the environment and strengthen the economy by investing in renewable energy technologies that create jobs while reducing global warming
9261118 the united states needs to set a bold new vision on energy policy and set a goal to achieve 100 of its electricity from clean renewable sources of power within 10 years
9261119 drilling on our public lands that are critical habitat for wildlife for the last drop of oil is not going to solve our energy or climate crisis
9261120 irresponsible energy development is turning our public lands in the west into one giant pin cushion and it wont reduce gas prices at the pump we need commitments from our elected officials that theyll get down to the business of solving these problems without sacrificing what americans cherish about the west
9261121 ive spent my life fishing and hunting and ive witnessed firsthand the rapid changes triggered by global warming
9261122 we can only solve our climate and energy crisis by cutting carbon emissions and developing new clean energy sources at the same time these problems are linked and so are their solutions
9261123 conservation is a way of life for millions of americans who care about the natural heritage were leaving behind for our children and grandchildren
9261124 the decisions we make today will affect them long after were gone we owe it to them to do everything we can to find better energy choices that help prevent the worst consequences of climate change
9261125 god is the gospel piper states that the church has confused the many blessings of the gospel with the gospel itself and has often missed the greatest blessing of the gospel

9261127 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9261128 i the prime minister have come to office in the appropriate way and i wont resign i will not back down i will rule this advertisement country and will lead it through all of the problems
9261129 i have been very patient and have refrained from using force
9261130 many have criticised me for being too soft but if the government cracked down we would be criticised for using excessive force
9261131 you never know which part of the internet youll need
9261132 which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
9261133 the prices have just gone up again and our annual hire bill will increase by thousands we dont have much choice because we are resident at the pool so we are a captive audience
9261134 our only choice is to raise our membership fees but thats making it extremely expensive for the elite swimmers who need a lot of time in the water every week and im worried some will not be able to carry on
9261135 we will inevitably lose several clubs over this and the problem is there are fewer clubs emerging so there are fewer people practising swimming as a sport
9261136 we did a survey of clubs and most of them said they would willingly take on more members but they just cant get the water time and with prices rising as they are thats not likely to change
9261137 because many schools do not offer swimming as part of the curriculum all our recruiting is done from clubs
9261138 the clubs run learn to swim programmes which are very popular and we watch children all the way through until they are 12 or 13 which is when you can identify talent
9261139 the real problem with clubs going out of business is not only that swimmers have nowhere to train but also thousands of children will never even learn to swim
9261140 a large number of houses have collapsed in the area
9261141 the plane lined up on the runway then it went back to the buildings and there was a bit of a delay
9261142 they must have known the company was going bust and they knew the return flight wouldnt happen but we werent told anything i now have to pay 500 to get home again im annoyed i wasnt told on the plane if they knew at that point
9261143 ive been ringing zooms america office for weeks to change my flights but there was no answer
9261144 i eventually rang the company in britain who charged me to make the changes that was a complete waste of time and i have to pay again for another flight
9261145 it was meant to be a bargain and it has ended up costing me almost double the original price i will be looking into refunds as soon as i get home
9261146 it is categorically untrue that zoom knew beforehand what was going to happen the plans on wednesday and thursday were to announce a new investment package of some new investors we were planning the extension of further routes
9261147 she has an extraordinary talent when it comes to communicating personally with people its as simple as that
9261148 that obviously propelled her into the governors mansion in alaska
9261149 i will probably always visit new orleans but i have no desire to move back there
9261150 you know especially now that my mom is sick they will come and check in on her ask me if i need them to take her to the doctor
9261151 there is no contract on friendship so we just continued to have close connections
9261152 i know a lot of the levees have not been repaired a lot of work still needed to be done
9261153 its something more we have to monitor but its immunization been deemed worthwhile
9261154 these little children are quite susceptible to many kinds of diseases and germs
9261155 all the people who come in contact with them and who cant get vaccinated for whatever reason
9261156 these children could be spreaders of flu so immunizing them certainly benefits everybody
9261157 if we are still lacking someones documentation by dec 1 we will give them fair warning
9261158 otherwise they are mandated to receive them or they will be excluded from school
9261159 whenever the state makes regulations and we have to carry them out its always a scramble the first year it comes down
9261160 when they come up with these regulations id hope there was research behind it as to why theyre mandating it
9261161 i dont think theyre just making it up hoping it will prevent more outbreaks
9261162 its extremely cumbersome for schools to track but you do what you have to do
9261163 weve never tested this vaccine on infants we dont know how it will react with other vaccines theyre required to get
9261164 its always been our choice and now its out of our hands we have to do it
9261165 if its a public health thing like rubella or measles yes i get that
9261166 this has nothing to do with kids this is absolutely the drug companies and the state going to bed with each other
9261167 its something more we have to monitor but its immunization been deemed worthwhile
9261168 these little children are quite susceptible to many kinds of diseases and germs
9261169 all the people who come in contact with them and who cant get vaccinated for whatever reason
9261170 these children could be spreaders of flu so immunizing them certainly benefits everybody
9261171 if we are still lacking someones documentation by dec 1 we will give them fair warning
9261172 otherwise they are mandated to receive them or they will be excluded from school
9261173 obviously this is a huge day the excitement was just unbelievable
9261174 there was excitement before but after thursday nights speech and fridays announcement quite honestly i was caught off guard
9261175 i got phone calls from people who arent normally political
9261176 thats what really made me feel very positive about today those are the people who are going to mean winning this election
9261177 prior to today they were talking about the convention but today really added a spark the convention is the time to really kick the campaigns into high gear and thats what well do all of next week locally and nationally
9261178 was just one of those days that ranked right up there
9261179 i actually got chewed out because headquarters closed at 8 30 p m and i got a call from a guy who wanted bumper stickers
9261180 my cell phones voice mail and that at county republican headquarters were full and my home phone was ringing off the hook
9261181 the overwhelming response for signs bumper stickers and people asking where they could sign up to volunteer for the campaign its been a very great day
9261182 shes a governor and has more experience than obama shes a mother of five and went ahead and carried a down syndrome baby and that fits our partys ideals perfectly
9261183 one of the groups i heard the most from today was democrats who werent happy with their ticket they said she fits their ideals and that their party really turned their back on sen hillary clinton
9261184 the excitement on the floor thats the inside right now i dont really know a lot about the process i know we have morning breakfast meetings to bring you up to speed on daily events the big thing is just being there its like when the cleveland indians are in the race for the world series and being there in the middle of it its hard to imagine just how exciting it will be from seeing it on tv compared to being there in real life
9261185 pretty impressive i see california gov arnold schwarzenegger that will be cool and ive always admired first lady laura bush she speaks well sen joe lieberman of connecticut has grown on me over the years im not disappointed he wasnt chosen as a practical matter i dont think that would have worked louisiana gov bobby jindal is kind of a rising star those are the names that jump out at me obviously at the top of the list is sen mccain and were just getting to know gov sarah palin i have a tremendous respect for john mccain and im looking forward to him rising to the challenge and our seeing what he can do
9261186 the staff put a lot of thought into the selection and sen mccain obviously must be satisfied that she was a good choice
9261187 i imagine well see a lot of good things in the days and weeks ahead ive heard shes fiscally responsible and thats good
9261188 has been around a long time we know who he is he has accomplishments and a record of bipartisanship hes walked the walk im very much impressed by him
9261189 as this budget stalemate stretches into the third month and unfortunately closes in on the all time record for a late budget real people are being increasingly hurt
9261190 if no budget is enacted in september schools hospitals nursing homes and small businesses will have lost out on an estimated 12 billion in critical funding since july 1 without a budget college students entering classes in september will not have received more than 120 million in financial assistance for books tuition and room and board community colleges will be shut out of 1 4 billion in state funds they depend on and more than 4 7 billion in medi cal payments will not have been made to hospitals nursing homes rural health care clinics and regional developmental services centers that serve our most vulnerable populations
9261191 after two months in deadlock it is unconscionable for legislative republicans to hold the state budget hostage without ever having produced a counter proposal legislative republicans have an obligation to this state to produce an alternative i think were all wondering when theyre going to level with california and explain why after months and months they have not shared with the public a single complete budget proposal californias teachers students and their parents police officers firefighters seniors and kids without health insurance need to hear what cuts republican legislators have in mind for them legislative democrats and our republican governor have produced fair bi partisan and responsible budget proposals based on gut wrenching compromises we have taken a common ground common sense approach that includes a mix of responsible cuts new revenues and no borrowing while still including key reforms including larger reserves and a rainy day fund it is well past time for my legislative republican colleagues to bring forth a plan for consideration
9261192 being able to see the chalkboard or reading a lesson book will have an immediate impact on a student fitted with eyeglasses
9261193 to date more than 500 eyeglasses have been donated to help the children in the mount kilimanjaro region
9261194 these mussels are another example of the large number of invasive species threatening california each and every day
9261195 our border stations do important work to protect the people of our state by protecting the environment and the food supply
9261196 its never boring and its been different from the high school principalship from the standpoint of working with more adults directly and less with students
9261197 this job gives me an opportunity to have a positive effect on students lives just in a different way than ive done in the past
9261198 its going very well so far its certainly been an educational first month
9261199 and i think other aspects of the job that have been interesting is just having to kind of be the final decision on a number of school related legal type issues and theres great responsibility with that
9261200 we eliminated a principals position and just have two now
9261201 the national average for successful completion is 50 percent successful 50 percent termination
9261202 we went into it hoping ours would be slightly above that but i knew it was a solid program that an offender would have to work hard to get through
9261203 im not willing to compromise the program layout to improve the numbers so it looks better research shows this is how drug court must be set up to be successful and have an effect on long term sobriety
9261204 i see the offenders at their lowest its always satisfying to see them on that last day for some of them its a complete lifestyle change its an amazing thing to see
9261205 its hard to stay the course especially in the beginning
9261206 in the first few weeks the cold hard truth of sobriety hits hard
9261207 i hope we give them the tools to make the right decisions it takes practice to use those tools those skills dont develop overnight they dont leave here being cured
9261208 even though some people are discharged they still continue to work on their problems
9261209 there are a lot of requirements some people working on their recovery couldnt stick with the requirements of the program but they continue to work on their recovery the program gave them a good foundation
9261210 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9261211 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9261212 the world is impressed with malaysia because not many countries with a multiracial population exist with tolerance peace and harmony
9261213 a united people is a strong national bulwark against any threat whether from within or outside the country
9261214 we see the constitution being weakened democracy trampled on and national institution turned into tools of the ruling power
9261215 it is time for malaysians to rediscover the real meaning of freedom in the country
9261216 efforts by certain parties to destabilize the country by attempting to seize power through illegitimate means and without the mandate of the people must be rejected
9261217 we cannot allow uncertainties to continue as this will adversely affect foreign investment economic sentiment and the capital markets i will not allow these disturbances to continue
9261218 its gonna be sad because this year at the end of the sixth grade we were gonna graduate and she could have been with us
9261219 and were gonna miss her a lot because when we were sad shed try and cheer us up shed make us laugh
9261220 i think she had a little bit of the second year cross country jinx last year
9261221 there were a lot of little things that bothered her last year both on and off the course that arent there this year she has been running great workouts all season and im looking for her to have a great senior year
9261222 i cant see the state meet of champions as a huge goal because were so young but the kids have talked about it and howard assistant coach schuman and i are probably going to take them to the shore meet to get them on the holmdel course before state meet
9261223 i think she had a little bit of the second year cross country jinx last year
9261224 there were a lot of little things that bothered her last year both on and off the course that arent there this year she has been running great workouts all season and im looking for her to have a great senior year
9261225 i cant see the state meet of champions as a huge goal because were so young but the kids have talked about it and howard assistant coach schuman and i are probably going to take them to the shore meet to get them on the holmdel course before state meet
9261226 all i know is i have doubles at 2 30 today
9261227 thats about as far as im thinking i think its tough to make any kind of decision in a rash moment and there was no decision made before the tournament so i dont think its time to make a certain statement now
9261228 i just never felt comfortable out there and then i was trying so hard to come back in the second set and then played one of the worst games of my career at 5 all
9261229 thats the way it goes i gave myself more of a chance and clawed my way through not playing great and making it competitive
9261230 i never felt like i had my feet underneath me here
9261231 i dont know if thats a combination of not playing much this summer not practicing much
9261232 probably helped me turn that match around its a shame that i couldnt have turned it around a little bit better in my favor
9261233 all i know is i have doubles at 2 30 today
9261234 thats about as far as im thinking i think its tough to make any kind of decision in a rash moment and there was no decision made before the tournament so i dont think its time to make a certain statement now
9261235 i just never felt comfortable out there and then i was trying so hard to come back in the second set and then played one of the worst games of my career at 5 all
9261236 thats the way it goes i gave myself more of a chance and clawed my way through not playing great and making it competitive
9261237 i never felt like i had my feet underneath me here
9261238 i dont know if thats a combination of not playing much this summer not practicing much
9261239 we went after the police and i was in the second row i was tear gassed
9261240 he has been co operating with investigators and weve had the opportunity to sit down with him and get his version of the events
9261241 everyone that went to the hospital is still in the hospital
9261242 they are grieving they went through a horrific event and theyre doing as well as could be expected given the circumstance
9261243 no one could have passed those balls better was on target bulls eyes all day he could have been 31 of 33 with no picks
9261244 offensively i tried to say way back particularly to most of the experts in this room if you put nine people in the box were going to throw the football
9261245 i dont know how to run with nine in the box i hated to throw the ball at the end but they wouldnt take nine men out of the box
9261246 i was a little concerned the defense was on the field a lot
9261247 defensively we came out a little better in the second half and we stopped them from big plays we played a lot of people today and we wanted to do some things with a lot of people
9261248 we couldnt really have too many great drives offensively because we scored with big plays so it didnt really help the defense much
9261249 his hang times were excellent every kickoff was four plus our special teams were good
9261250 how the image would be perceived by a motorist passing it in transit
9261251 the reason we have advised you that we cannot post these as billboards is that out of context neither in a museum setting or website the images as stand alone highway or city billboards appear to be deceased soldiers the presentation in this manner could be perceived as being disrespectful to the men and women in our armed forces
9261252 my son and his friends would have been of draft age had there been a draft though none of them volunteered for military service since the war began i wondered about the young men and women who opted to serve and put their lives on the line i wondered about what they would experience at war and how they would manage their transition to civilian life in making these portraits i wanted to look into the face of a young person who had seen something unforgettable and i wanted to make that a serious and intimate view the way i would look at my own son
9261253 viewing these portraits of soldiers causes one to pause and think of the many sacrifices and efforts these men and women have experienced to protect us and defend this great country the portraits are a stark reminder of the reality of it all
9261254 for me looking at their faces serves also as a reminder to remember our service men and women and to thank them for all they do and have done i am disappointed that the billboards have been canceled and strongly hope the company will reconsider
9261255 we have every intention of moving forward with our plans
9261256 barring these images from billboards in the twin cities or any city for that matter not only deprives the public of seeing these beautiful portraits but it is an insult to the young soldiers who posed for these pictures
9261257 you know nasas 50th anniversary i think really does sort of date me because i was there at the beginning of that
9261258 people have contributed so much to that 50 year period its just amazing
9261259 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9261260 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9261261 we were hoping to get a picture with them but it didnt work out
9261262 i stopped by to get a hot dog then saw the police and thought i would wait around i was just delighted to talk to cindy and senator mccain and congratulated him on his vice presidential selection
9261263 i was out running to the store to the bank doing my errands shegogs got a phone call about it so i went home and got my son randall and camera
9261264 weve had cake already its been an all day meal for us
9261265 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9261266 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9261267 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9261268 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9261269 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency

9261275 the aim of the club is to offer respite to parents who are hospice patients and to family members who are providing continuous care to hospice patients the club also helps to alleviate the children from the psychological hardships emerging from the illness and offers the children quality time and interaction with other children
9261276 the magnitude of the impact of this judgement has dampened what are otherwise very encouraging results
9261277 in a depressingly familiar pattern as bird migration begins protected birds are being targeted both on land and at sea said dr andr raine birdlife maltas conservation manager
9261278 despite the predictable upsurge in illegal hunting the ale are still committed to other duties such as beach patrols
9261279 while we have seen that the ale in particular are effective when they are out in the countryside at present they are repeatedly unable to deal with illegal hunting reports due to their extremely limited resources this is not an acceptable situation
9261280 wed love to figure out the cause then we could keep future cases from happening
9261281 and i think most of this community should be upset because it could be their kid next
9261282 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9261283 this is the real deal this is not a test
9261284 one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9261285 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9261286 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9261287 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented

9261289 this protocol is beneficial to both countries as it will strengthen the already good relationship which exists and act as a catalyst to increase commerce and trade and encourage further cooperation between malta and france
9261290 all together we now have treaties with about 50 countries with some in the pipeline at various stages of negotiation
9261291 this is a sensitive area where social and political considerations are very high on every governments agenda
9261292 old buses or at least bus engines which fail todays stricter standards should be written off and replaced there is a significant number of buses which are not roadworthy the public deserves a modern comfortable and efficient system in this day and age we still are using buses with no space for wheelchairs or pushchairs or bicycles and which are difficult for some people to use it is high time for real change in this sector
9261293 buses should work with cleaner fuels like lpg liquefied petroleum gas or cng compressed natural gas and electric buses can also be introduced
9261294 our kids tell us that he better have directions for taking care of it when he croaks when he passes away because theyll have no idea what to do with it
9261295 i was afraid it was going to be thrown away some of the instruments were really beautiful i didnt want to see them trashed
9261296 if something needs fixed ill fix it or ill try
9261297 ill tell you what kellen lewis is a difference maker and he really made the difference today
9261298 i was encouraged we came out and we competed not well enough to win but we competed hard all afternoon you have to make plays to win and indiana made more plays than we did today
9261299 i tried to use the fire extinguisher that did not work a bucket of water did not work it spread so fast i had to get out of the house and cal 911
9261300 i come for the tailgating the crowds and the atmosphere
9261301 its great to meet people and they all seem to come together as one here
9261302 last year as freshman made you feel so much a part of a group and it was so much fun i live for badger football school may not have started yet but look at the crowds here to be a badger you have to support your school and thats why i come to the games
9261303 opening day is the start of a new season and there is so much excitement that goes with it
9261304 the crowds are fantastic and i hope i can keep doing this until im 80
9261305 defeating two quality opponents in pacific and uab is a great start to our season
9261306 we matured in both matches playing against two distinct styles we accomplished our goal of starting the year 2 0 and continued to grow as a team with each and every set
9261307 henry schein is ready to help support our dental medical and veterinary customers whose practices may be adversely affected by natural disasters

9261311 were mccain supporters because hes conservative i believe he stands for more of the values that we do hes pro life
9261312 we dont believe in socialism referring to democratic nominee barack obamas plan for national health care
9261313 shes a hockey mom a working mom shes not scared to fight corruption shes full of energy theres nothing like a woman who can multitask shes the epitome of a super mom
9261314 mccain wants change he wants people to be better and stronger and he will make a difference in this country
9261315 im running for president to make government stand on your side not in your way
9261316 i spent the last few months looking for a running mate who can help me shake up washington and stop the corruption and clean it up
9261317 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington and when you get to know her youre going to be as impressed as i am
9261318 shes got a lot of grit and integrity and appeals to folks and the common good which is what we need today
9261319 a true barnesville booster whose impact on the community remains evident
9261320 i really like what john mccain stands for especially on the issue of pro life and i think sarah palin is an excellent choice to join him on the republican ticket
9261321 she is pro life and she is a woman which i really like
9261322 really excited because now we have a real pro life candidate i think senator mccain will bring his experience and she will learn from him and add strength to the ticket
9261323 i am very impressed by senator mccains choice he made a good choice and i am very happy that she is a social conservative i like her position on the social issues and i think she will add strength to the mccain ticket because he has already taken a strong position on the same social issues
9261324 i think she is so very american from everything she believes in and everything she has done he could not have made a better choice she may not have a lot of national experience but that shouldnt affect voting for mccain and palin she has about the same governmental administrative experience as obama has
9261325 because i havent made my mind up yet i am a democrat but i am excited about palin she has been running the state of alaska and apparently doing a good job i like what i have heard so far
9261326 i think gov palin will bring new and fresh ideas to the campaign plus she is a woman and that is good news i believe she may draw some of the hillary clinton supporters to john mccains campaign and i like the fact she is pro life
9261327 she chose to have her baby after she found out it would likely be a down syndrome baby that tells me a lot about her as a woman and a person she is a strong woman who understands what the average american is going through these days and i believe she will bring a lot to the national political scene now and in the future
9261328 because she stands for a lot of solid beliefs such as family values and moral issues i also like the fact she favors drilling for oil
9261329 i think a lot of women who supported hillary clinton will now consider voting for the mccain palin ticket and that will help us win in november
9261330 i dont care that we have sat in the sun for several hours today
9261331 we are absolutely thrilled by senator mccains choice of sarah palin she fills a lot of squares for the republicans she will be an asset for the ticket
9261332 the sun doesnt matter today because it is just good to be here today to see this historic campaign ticket i am excited and very happy with the addition of sarah palin to the campaign
9261333 t m on oudoin harrastukseni mutta t ll on omanlaisensa tunnelma
9261334 time has now come for me to move on and try to reach new horizons
9261335 dont rely on law enforcement dont rely on judges rely on yourself
9261336 they could permanently ruin their lives the new job that they may want or getting into a military service or going to college all that is on your record so one episode of drinking and driving can ruin your lives
9261337 they put up a fight i love fishing for carp
9261338 theyre carp multiplying and theyre eating the food that our game fish of wisconsin would eat so theyre kind of crowding out the good fish
9261339 even though we have people from out of state we do have people who care about the river and we do care about the fishing and the activities here
9261340 we were fishing last year and the water was even with the bank and it was higher and quieter this year the waters calm and its way down
9261341 i think the biggest thing is it jazzes up our ticket watching the shows last night the wow factor the ump factor clearly its one of those momentum things it is a little risky but mccain is mccain
9261342 do you want me to take another in case that one doesnt come out
9261343 seven but four are with their dear mother in the cemetery
9261344 can you recommend something that will remind me of birthdays and anniversaries
9261345 we cant be quite as generous as we have been in the past based on the economic situation we have right now
9261346 im 45 years old so this wii stuff is new to me and every time i come to class i learn something
9261347 weve seen that it helps with their motivation to participate in more traditional therapies
9261348 we can tailor the goals of the group based on the patients individual needs
9261349 they have been coming steady all day coming with three or four truck loads of goods
9261350 tvs computers things like that take up so much space and we have a side benefit that eliminates additional lead that might get into the landfill
9261351 it makes me feel good that a lot of people are involved in this and trying to take action to try and get these items somewhere they can be reused or recycled
9261352 it makes it a little hard to trust the school system
9261353 im sorry if theres been some miscommunication or misunderstanding or if students perhaps were not at the bus stop at the time the bus came and picked up kids but the bus obviously ran its route and delivered kids to school on time
9261354 there seems to be a communications gap because the calls are being made to the school and theyre just not being passed along
9261355 we will never be able to do this where will sa and zimbabwe get that kind of money
9261356 we cannot be the same as the us which spends huge amounts of money we have other responsibilities like getting water houses and electricity to our people
9261357 i felt more comfortable thursday just because i was able to get rep after rep after rep
9261358 is not like baseball where you get an at bat and then you have to wait a half hour to hit again
9261359 but there were some throws i thought he could have brought up a little bit they were a bit low
9261360 i think the coaches will decide if they saw me do enough things thursday and in the other games
9261361 i think overall our third group which includes me did a great job
9261362 theres nothing i can do about that i think they drafted me for a reason but things happen
9261363 you just have to roll with it and im not really going to worry about that im going to go back and watch some film we have a couple days off here so ill go hang out and hopefully ill be moving over to jersey
9261364 but im glad i got to come out here and show my teammates i can play
9261365 i felt more comfortable thursday just because i was able to get rep after rep after rep

9261372 but im glad i got to come out here and show my teammates i can play
9261373 were just going to see how he does tomorrow and how he feels
9261374 one more test hopefully itll be the last one before we get in a game
9261375 this is the uniform im wearing now and i have a job to do
9261376 were just going to see how he does tomorrow and how he feels
9261377 one more test hopefully itll be the last one before we get in a game
9261378 this is the uniform im wearing now and i have a job to do
9261379 its a process it isnt something that you wait until the final hour its ongoing
9261380 its always a time of a certain amount of anxiety because you cant get away from the fact the mixture is really critical you have to be aware how these individuals are going to fit together and play roles on special teams
9261381 i didnt want to be a practice squad guy i didnt want to be a special teams guy i wanted to beat plax out
9261382 it may sound silly but like my mom says reach for the stars if you dont make it you land up on the moon thats what i tried to do
9261383 he really has played the best of that second group of linemen
9261384 weve always considered him the first guy in if we had anything to contend with we stuck him in there at tackle where he has practiced a little bit just to make sure he understood he has to know guard and tackle
9261385 we have to make decisions first of all on what is the condition of lawrence tynes
9261386 its from that decision the decision from the medical people that we have to make the right decision for our team well have to see where that goes
9261387 its a process it isnt something that you wait until the final hour its ongoing
9261388 its always a time of a certain amount of anxiety because you cant get away from the fact the mixture is really critical you have to be aware how these individuals are going to fit together and play roles on special teams

9261394 its from that decision the decision from the medical people that we have to make the right decision for our team well have to see where that goes
9261395 in the current economy its important to think fashionable but also focus on getting the longest wear life out of a wardrobe
9261396 this can often be achieved by layering for a lasting quality allowing the wearer to take the look from the fall season into the winter months
9261397 in the current economy its important to think fashionable but also focus on getting the longest wear life out of a wardrobe
9261398 this can often be achieved by layering for a lasting quality allowing the wearer to take the look from the fall season into the winter months
9261399 t advertisement he people didnt want to join and we didnt have enough money
9261400 if the us administration sees that its war against the muslims is legitimate then what makes us believe that our war on its territories is not legitimate
9261401 everyone must know that we will not hesitate in targeting it whenever we can and wherever it is on this planet
9261402 a group that had limited its terrorist activities to algeria is now part of the global jihad movement
9261403 these groups as best we can tell have a fair amount of independence they get inspiration they get sometimes guidance probably some training probably some money from the al qaeda leadership
9261404 its not as centralised a movement as it was say in 2001 but in some ways the fact that it has spread in the way that it has in my view makes it perhaps more dangerous
9261405 the brothers implementing the process are connected with us and we have previously trained some of them and we offer them adequate support for the implementation of such operations
9261406 successfully employed by insurgents and terrorists in iraq and afghanistan
9261407 terrorism has been vanquished despite the sporadic manifestation we are facing up to in the most energetic manner
9261408 we activated the hamilton county emergency operation center this morning at ten oclock and brought a lot of these agencies together to start preparing to start looking at the needs that we would have if in fact we are to receive some people
9261409 i think one thing that we didnt address maybe was some of their spiritual needs and some of the mental health issues and were trying to be a little bit more proactive with that to have some folks available to deal with those kinds of issues
9261410 weve all been in contact and weve all put our volunteers on alert and on stand by and everybody i think is going to enjoy the holiday weekend but be ready for if something were to happen
9261411 the biggest lesson we all learned from katrina is to be prepared we didnt want anything like that to happen again
9261412 the air national guard stepped up and they did a wonderful job here
9261413 we got ambulances we got the army troopers protection wise we should be fine
9261414 y ou need good vision to get along and have a quality lifestyle
9261415 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9261416 this is the real deal this is not a test
9261417 one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9261418 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9261419 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9261420 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9261421 if we dont get the wind and rain we stand ready to help them
9261422 i saw the men getting out of the car and i approached them first and said just get back in your car
9261423 they were like fuck you your fucking friends are faggots and one of them punched me in the face
9261424 or maybe in this case i should say liver spots since well be http lovingskincare com acne

9261428 really i havent of course ive never been to alaska before either
9261429 i think its a pretty smart move getting a female
9261430 i hope it wins over some of the female voters
9261431 whether or not it will get any of the former clinton backers thats doubtful because the political records of palin and clinton are so different their philosophies are different
9261432 i havent cast my vote just yet but now im going to re examine some things
9261433 it was a great win a good performance by the springboks
9261434 the voters approved the bonds its there and weve got to pay for it
9261435 we really didnt have much of a campaign to educate the voters
9261436 low income families will spend 15 17 percent of their income in consumer products
9261437 we raise property tax about five cents for the next 12 years
9261438 those things there are collection fees to that and there are a number of services
9261439 i went to treatment before this and i still wasnt in the right mindset once i got charged and got in here it was very important for me to have these charges over my head trying to be clean is next to impossible for me youve got to have help
9261440 he is a good example of how to persevere through a bump in the road
9261441 with cocaine and alcohol you stop you get a hangover and it goes away
9261442 but when you stop taking these pills you get really physically ill you are physically dependent on them after just using them for a few weeks
9261443 after i got into the pills everything else went by the wayside
9261444 its not a matter of getting high and having fun when you wake up you are so ill that the only thing on your mind is being able to get these pills so you can function
9261445 when you take opiates for a long period of time the body depends on that outside source for pain relief and stops producing the natural painkiller when you take the drug away your body isnt producing the natural pain killer anymore and you are in complete pain the withdrawal is your body trying to heal itself and it does
9261446 that four months was the first period of sobriety of any length since i was 18
9261447 i battled that for eight years and never got any better its sickening it takes a period of sobriety for you to understand whats going on with you you dont even realize the things you are doing or the people you are hurting
9261448 you can be 100 percent positive and swear on the bible that you mean it but you end up fooling yourself in the end because its such a powerful addiction i felt i had more knowledge about my addiction this time and i knew what to look for the only thing i could do was try my best i knew i couldnt make any guarantees
9261449 one of the main deterrents for me was i had all these charges
9261450 if i got sentenced i could go to prison for 10 or 15 years once you get the cobwebs out of your system and you arent sick and depressed you get into a normal groove once i got rolling it was good it just took 10 years to get rolling i guess
9261451 they let the class kind of counsel itself its good to hear what people in the same situations as you have to say you can help them and they can help you
9261452 the big thing that was different than the other times i tried to stop was that i was actually letting other people help me i was not thinking i was smarter than everyone else i did what other people said even though i didnt think it was right
9261453 listen to them and have them hear where i stand on the issues i appreciate that they willingly offer opinions suggestions and input
9261454 naturally they were concerned that we live up to our obligation to veterans
9261455 theres a general concern among veterans regardless of age that this country has failed to live up to the obligations they have to those who have sacrificed a lot of people have thanked me for our work on veterans issues all over the district a lot of people follow that with interest
9261456 there seemed to be wide support for the idea that we need to drill more for oil as well as produce a comprehensive energy plan that would include domestic production increases
9261457 we really enjoy just sharing our art with one another and with anyone who is willing to come out and see it
9261458 it really lets kids get hands on on making art with what you have it doesnt have to be an expensive hobby
9261459 we recycle auto parts iron and steel its all recycling
9261460 we can confirm that two bodies were recovered last night from the main part of osbaston house the remains will be examined by a home office pathologist and postmortems are due to be carried out to establish the cause of death
9261461 it is going to be a painstaking and lengthy process before the full examination of the house and its surrounds is completed in the meantime we will keep an open mind concerning what we may or may not find
9261462 we must stress that the foster family still remain unaccounted for
9261463 i did not think they would find them in there its very upsetting i did not think they would find any bodies i thought maybe they had gone away its terrible
9261464 its very tragic i would not be shocked if they found a third body the police said they had got all the ports on alert and nothing came of that theres been no sighting of them
9261465 you tend to think then its a process of elimination
9261466 a charming popular and hard working girl with many friends
9261467 its anyones guess but it seems that the people he owed money to are big companies and i cant see them behind something like this
9261468 just flipped because the pressure of it was too much for him
9261469 he was just an ordinary everyday chap well dressed a good businessman
9261470 we are devastated this just does not happen to your own family its like something you see on television
9261471 to award a st andrews medal for civilian acts of bravery to anyone deserving of such an award
9261472 of course my father was happy to have received the george medal but he would have preferred something scottish
9261473 he was very happy to go to buckingham palace but now we have a devolved scottish government and maybe it is time for a st andrews medal it is right that the english should have their medal and the scots should have theirs
9261474 this isnt to do with independence or the snp its to do with scotland i hope the snp conference will now pass it
9261475 both alistair and his father whilst very happy to have been decorated felt that it should have been a scottish medal
9261476 this will certainly be backed at conference and it will then become party policy it will then be the responsibility of the snp government to make it happen this would be a replacement medal the george medal and the george cross are english medals
9261477 what the snp want to do and it is very clever is bit by bit they are trying to make people more willing to accept things that are scottish only rather than scottish and british it is separation by stealth all this is a cleverly worked out strategy to try to move things in the direction whereby each step of itself is not much but when it adds up it is quite a lot
9261478 it should be stressed that the george cross is named after a sovereign not a saint
9261479 the british george medal depicts saint george of england slaying a mythical dragon a representation that remains quintessentially english there is nothing wrong with that of course but clearly the scottish government will i am sure be keen to commission an award that reflects scotlands own national character in a manner that is more fitting for those who receive the medal
9261480 it is a crime that people who got shot by the germans didnt get a decent burial this gives some people the impression that the germans won after all and we cannot allow that
9261481 my mother looked for him her entire life he was 11 when it happened she died recently and now i am the one who is searching for him im actively searching for him 65 years after it happened
9261482 in the past relatives would write a letter and receive a formal reply which most often said nothing at all now the authorities are making more of an effort they search archives some of which were previously closed visit cemeteries and interview people who are old enough to remember witnesses are dying out and it is now or never this new attitude points to a change in mentality
9261483 as soon as we know it is the body of my grandfather he will be buried in the loene military cemetery as a member of the resistance its where he belongs
9261484 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9261485 this is the real deal this is not a test
9261486 one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9261487 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9261488 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9261489 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9261490 i would never do it again if a patient asked me to help them die in the future i would say i was very sorry but that i could not be of practical help however i would offer them moral support and listen to what they had to say
9261491 a change in the law has to be left to politicians assisted suicide is not something i have talked to people about on a regular basis but everyone i have talked to has been sympathetic to the idea
9261492 my feeling is that your opinions on this matter are very much related to your experiences for example seeing an elderly person gradually deteriorating
9261493 i think people want to have some control over whats going on its the loss of control over your circumstances thats the worst if i could be of use to msps i would do so as long as it was not going to put my work in jeopardy
9261494 i absolutely welcome dr kerr to the campaign i am inviting him to the parliament to speak about his experience and give his perspective
9261495 we are in a land situation with the law stating that assisted suicide is illegal but with the medical profession effectively admonishing kerr the law is an ass as far as this situation is concerned
9261496 dr kerr seems to be a terrific doctor full of humanity and understanding and able to put his patients wishes first
9261497 baseball hasnt forgotten me i go to a lot of old timers games and i havent lost a thing i sit in the bullpen and let people throw things at me just like old times
9261498 hopefully this time well get down there a little earlier and well have more of an impact to help the people down there
9261499 three years ago we got down after the hurricane hit this year well be there before it hits and well be able to help a lot of people
9261500 you would be surprised how many children cant run jump and throw properly maybe they can do it in one way but it isnt the right way and they need someone to teach them how to do it better the standard is pretty bad at the moment
9261501 we have not invented anything new here this used to be what children were taught in school
9261502 even a warm up jog sometimes is more than they can manage and they lack basic strength to handle their own bodyweight we want to be working with appropriately fit youngsters its not all the fault of the schools but its a factor
9261503 there is a concern about the general standard of fitness these days its not as good as it has been in the past
9261504 if you ask children to run around a pitch there are more of them who will have great difficulty than there used to be some of them because they are overweight
9261505 when it comes to athletics those are highly specialised skills and it must be difficult for pe teachers to impress upon the children these are the skills they need we need more opportunities in school to do sport and we need to address the timetable as sport is often squeezed out
9261506 we need to have a really strong grassroots level for athletics that will have a knock on effect on the numbers of people wanting to compete at the top level at the olympics and commonwealth games
9261507 we know who the athletes are who will compete in the next games but we need investment at national level from the scottish government if we are going to make a difference to the legacy of athletes who are to compete in the 2016 olympics we need to have this or we are not going to get there
9261508 it is a material and emotional recognition of the mistakes that our country has done to yours during the colonial era
9261509 gas possibilities possibilities for libyan oil which is of the best quality
9261510 those tragic and dramatic moments of the italian occupation of your country
9261511 in the name of the italian people as head of government i feel it is my duty to offer an apology and make plain our sorrow for that which happened so many years ago and which affected so many of your families
9261512 if they say we can advertisement t guarantee your safety you dont go
9261513 these subjects are part of a longer and midterm discussion
9261514 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country invading and occupying our country then recognising part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9261515 we are not going to be drawn on the details of that conversation the next step will be the european council meeting
9261516 with barack obama in the white house and democrats leading in congress we will revitalize the economy create jobs make college affordable again and enable hard working americans to pay for gas food utilities and cover the monthly bills
9261517 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9261518 i have found the right partner to help me stand up to those who value their privileges over their responsibilities who put power over principle and put their interest before your needs
9261519 hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that ceiling once and for all
9261520 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9261521 i havent met her before she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story a personal story
9261522 im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same
9261523 and what struck me most about stephanie was how even after a decade in congress she was so utterly unaffected by the ways of washington she was still a homegirl stephanie couldnt put on airs if she tried
9261524 he was definitely outplaying me for the first two sets
9261525 i felt like a little kid out here playing against him
9261526 he was definitely outplaying me for the first two sets
9261527 i felt like a little kid out here playing against him
9261528 it would appear that bryans may be taking part in unofficial discussions
9261529 bryans idea is that the world ought to be divided into two parts that germany should be given a free hand in europe and that the british empire should run the rest of the world
9261530 i am not sure that this is a very desirable point of view to publish at the present time
9261531 bryans is a talkative and indiscreet fellow who is in possession of a story which he delights in telling and which if told publicly would be likely to cause embarrassment to the foreign office
9261532 although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views to all and sundry i understand that if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office and the facilities afforded him to go to italy
9261533 it occurs to me that this is a possible means of putting deception over to the enemy by the careful framing of the questionnaires as presumably the germans must if they capture some of these birds take notice of the type of question which is being asked
9261534 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9261535 our focus is really on this side of the river
9261536 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9261537 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9261538 if this work was hard or overwhelming if she ever felt any loneliness in so often being the first you never wouldve known it
9261539 because stephanie was not a complainer she always had that big smile even when times were tough self pity was never an option as far as stephanie was concerned
9261540 during this most recent contest stephanie and i started off on different sides and she we would see each other and she just said to me this is what it means to be a friend for me
9261541 what struck me most about stephanie was how even after a decade in congress she was so utterly unaffected by the ways of washington
9261542 the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities their insensitivity
9261543 i have often asked myself why why me why my daughter
9261544 i think everybody thinks the same thing it wont happen to me
9261545 all the food borne illnesses that are floating around this country of ours theres anger toward that that canadians have to be subjected to this type of lackadaisical attitude toward food safety
9261546 i want her death to be counted and for people to know this is a real hazard out there
9261547 whether listeria was the actual cause or the underlying cause is very difficult to determine
9261548 many of our recalls relate to products such as sandwiches and pre packaged meats meats carrying best before dates that have now already expired
9261549 nevertheless in the public interest and in the interest of openness we feel it is important that such info is visible
9261550 weve established ourselves as a party that cannot be described as fringe
9261551 as prime minister i told harper i would have been convening the leaders to figure out how we work on these key issues
9261552 i got no sense the prime minister is prepared to do what i would do if i were prime minister
9261553 with a green mp sitting in the house of commons it will now be impossible to exclude the green party from the televised leaders debates in the next election
9261554 our view is there should only be one liberal candidate in the leaders debate
9261555 you cant have two candidates from essentially the same party in the debate
9261556 cant bring in a ringer to boost him during the debate
9261557 i like to think canadians notice when someone breaks their word in such spectacular fashion
9261558 something spooked him and he changed his mind its contemptible
9261559 i dont like it going someplace you dont know people you dont know
9261560 and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9261561 the problem is there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9261562 he told each of the governors that federal officials were monitoring hurricane gustav very closely
9261563 president bush pledged the full support of the federal government
9261564 we felt equally strongly that we must be able to any time 24 7 to communicate a text message to our students even when theyre in the class and thats most the time monday through friday
9261565 people complain all the time that young people dont know anything about their history well this is why because we allow historic sites and other history programs to be unfunded and therefore shut down why would they know what lincoln did here
9261566 predicting how much damage will occur to oil platforms and rigs is a difficult task
9261567 these platforms and rigs may have sustained damage due to past storms and like anything else become more susceptible to threats of wind and storm surge
9261568 if one major deep water production platform is destroyed youre talking about a 1 billion or more loss
9261569 if its multiple rigs and platforms in a variety of water depths then were talking billions of dollars
9261570 while any drop in the number of uninsured is welcome news a closer look at the census bureau data for 2007 provides little cause for celebration
9261571 the new figure 45 7 million uninsured is still unacceptably high
9261572 its the second highest figure since the 1960s when medicare and medicaid were enacted into law we still have at least 8 1 million children who are uninsured a scandalous figure
9261573 not having health insurance or having poor quality insurance that doesnt protect you from financial hardship in the face of medical need is a source of mounting stress anguish and poor medical outcomes for people across our country
9261574 such gains are of little consolation when compared to the enormity of these disparities
9261575 the continuing high profile of the health care issue in the elections is another index of public anxiety about access to care
9261576 what is really needed is a system that removes the financial burden from patients and more effectively pools our funds into a public program that is able to address costs more effectively by introducing greater efficiency and value into our health care system
9261577 such a system would guarantee comprehensive health care to everyone by replacing the private insurance industry with a tax supported government agency or agencies that would pay all medical bills similar to the way medicare operates today but even better than medicare
9261578 people would have the freedom to choose their own doctors and hospitals
9261579 thats a single payer system such a system is embodied in h r 676 the u s national health insurance act introduced by rep john conyers d mich it currently has over 90 co sponsors in congress more than any other health reform proposal
9261580 it is important to realize that while the governors husband is a member of a union this does not automatically qualify her for an on the job training program to become a heartbeat away from the presidency and while her husband is one of 850 000 dues paying members of the steelworkers union it does nothing to absolve sen mccain of his long history of anti union sentiment and anti worker actions including continuously pushing an anti working family agenda that opposes giving workers the right to bargain collectively jeopardizes retirement security by privatizing social security further threatens job security by signing more job stealing trade deals without the regard to human rights and environmental abuses and erodes the ability of working families to secure quality health care by taxing their employer provided coverage for both active and retired workers mccains choice is another example of his poor judgment and his desire to play politics as usual mccain palin is not a team that works for working families the first term governors record is thin and divisive and john mccain has a life long record of being for the rich and powerful no union card can hide that any more than ronald regans union card did
9261581 this weekend we mark labor day a day set aside to honor the working men and women who keep our economy going and the day traditionally viewed as the end of summer
9261582 after a long summer that has seen six farm workers die in the heat despite state laws that were supposed to protect them i can think of no better way to honor labor day than empowering farm workers and ensuring that the laws on our books match the realities in the fields
9261583 just giving farm workers a fair shot at establishing a union can spur changes by growers who may move to improve conditions in order to head off support for a union
9261584 and if that gets shade and drinking water and legally required wages out into the fields thats a good thing
9261585 we need to talk about these things not just when a storm is staring us in the face and certainly not only after disaster strikes and another community is devastated
9261586 why be resigned to picking up pieces over and over again instead of keeping the pieces in place to begin with there is a new and better path to preserving homes and communities it is time to move down that path in this country before it is too late
9261587 when appropriate wind resistance and flood elevation are originally built in to a structure it can provide effective passive protection for the people who live or work in that building
9261588 people need to know that the state or local building code is the minimum level of protection allowed by law fortunately there are builders who know how to can and want to build to an even higher safety standard ibhs is proud to work with many of these builders along the gulf coast as part of our fortified for safer living r program
9261589 an unfortunate fact in many areas just inland of the hurricane prone coastline is that homes and businesses have not been built to resist the kinds of strong winds that can occur when a hurricane rips across the coast and pushes inland
9261590 houston pops up as a prime example of this risky proposition while the texas department of insurance high wind standards have been implemented with varying degrees of success in coastal communities houston area homes and businesses have been built with little regard for hurricane winds mother nature frequently misses those memos and a strong storm barreling toward the coast can bring high winds well inland
9261591 we must get serious about spending the extra two percent to three percent it typically requires to properly connect the pieces of our houses together
9261592 louisiana stepped up and has adopted modern building codes throughout their state other states need to do the same until we do widespread but preventable structural damage will continue whenever the winds approach or exceed hurricane force
9261593 the governors actions will put abused and neglected children at greater risk reduce access to medicaid and food stamps and further harm state parks and historic sites
9261594 these cuts are irresponsible and they are deep slashing 12 percent of the frontline workforce in child protection and more than 20 percent from historic preservation
9261595 the impact is made even worse when considered in light of steep cuts the blagojevich administration has previously made to these same agencies since 2001 dcfs has lost 28 percent of its frontline workforce dnr 21 percent and dhs field offices 20 percent
9261596 there is time to reverse these cuts but only if advocates concerned citizens and lawmakers act quickly
9261597 lawmakers should return to springfield as soon as possible to take whatever action is necessary to fix the budget and stop these cuts
9261598 quan es podr desenvolupar a espanya una tercera v a entre el conservadurisme y la socialdemocr cia basada en lideari liberal
9261599 one of the lessons learned from the katrina operation was that we needed to conduct some more detailed preplanned exercises
9261600 we will create what we call a mission execution forecast which shows data basically in six hour blocks for air assets whether it be flight level winds turbulence that they may encounter with thunderstorms
9261601 weve been getting calls from people from louisiana getting calls from people here who have relatives in louisiana asking do we have shelter for them
9261602 have done this for so long and going through so many crisis like this tornadoes and stuff we basically know what to expect and that is to expect the unexpected
9261603 they said turn on your news right now so we did
9261604 weve been glued to the tv for the next we just turned it off for about seven hours
9261605 even though she is not that experienced i think she will rise to that occasion
9261606 does he mccain think thats really going to work i mean does he think that women who are with hillary think hillary is some lego block you know you can take out a red one and put in a green one
9261607 well i hope i get invited to the inauguration i would go wouldnt you
9261608 we were doing some work to really get the old girl fixed up and now this happens
9261609 but oregon has bounced back from fires at our capitol twice before and we will fix her up again and restore her to her full glory
9261610 functionwrapper functionwrapper 1 i knew you could call jscript functions with less or more arguments than they expect in their definition and figured pulling off the same in a native method ill expose to the script would be ideal after a short investigation i learned of the idl
9261611 the troopers did not allow us to move outside for prayers
9261612 we are protesting against the arrest of hurriyet leaders and will continue till they are released
9261613 a probe should be initiated into the recent unprovoked firing in which four innocent protestors including a woman were martyred
9261614 t m on oudoin harrastukseni mutta t ll on omanlaisensa tunnelma
9261615 im elated to be bringing this event back to the area
9261616 people truly enjoy it and the response has been tremendous i am grateful to the sponsors who continue to support the show this years cooking show promises to be the biggest and best so far
9261617 cooking at home is something more and more consumers have been favoring in recent years especially with the tight economy
9261618 ive done lots of cooking schools and id like to say i wear a lot of different hats
9261619 i get to meet with lots of different vendors and its nice to see everyone sharing ideas and partnering together
9261620 home again will showcase many ohio proud food companies who produce some great products right here in our great state

9261625 literally one day after details of the kaminsky cache poisoning attack were revealed udp source port randomization was defeated in 10 hours by security researchers using brute force spoofed responses
9261626 nominums multi layered approach eliminates the risk of a successful attack
9261627 layered defenses in the dns system are an effective way to address serious attack scenarios that arent covered by udp source port randomization alone
9261628 as new dns vulnerabilities are discovered a layered approach such as nominums will help in ensuring ongoing internet security
9261629 layered security is the only way to defend against the emerging threats to the internet
9261630 our customers the largest networks in the world have an obligation to deliver the highest level of security in delivering internet service to consumer enterprise and government users nominums new software release ensures that our customers can meet that obligation immediately and completely
9261631 what were doing is we started a recycling program with the office of the athletic department and our student organization
9261632 we want to be here in order to guide them and educate them primarily on our program and how were working with the athletic department
9261633 on game day itself its been pretty much a free for all situation because there are certain areas that are limited as far as access to various waste so weve kind of had trouble pulling together a plan that works
9261634 what better way to be part of the educational component in the university than to show 80 000 people what recycling is all about so were really pleased to be working with athletics
9261635 well the worlds a beautiful place lets keep it that way and a great way to start it is to wear red think a little bit green its a simple thing just toss those plastic bottles into a recycling bin

9261642 peoples opinion of obama seems to be a little less positive and of mccain a little more positive its at the margins but ohio is going to be decided at the margins
9261643 he should be getting more traction he should be ahead by 8 9 12 maybe even 15 points
9261644 this has to do with mccain my feeling is that in the last two weeks maybe three mccains campaign has been working like a swiss watch its amazing somehow everything feels good about it including the ads they are masterful
9261645 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family
9261646 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough
9261647 butterflies that were once considered utterly common are going into a tailspin and nobody knows why
9261648 everywhere you look butterflies are in decline that really tells us something is wrong
9261649 i dont really like the russians invading georgia but they sure as hell better not try it with mississippi or texas
9261650 it was hard watching him go down because it reminded me of last year and what i went through
9261651 as i handed him the ball he didnt grab it he went down and was in some serious pain
9261652 one of the best backs in the country is lying there in pain its a sight you definitely dont want to see
9261653 i was talking to him on the sideline and he said yeah i kind of just freaked myself out
9261654 he kind of psyched himself out but then the docs talked to him and he kind of calmed down i think hell be fine
9261655 its great to be back i couldnt sleep last night thinking about it it felt real good to be back playing with my boys
9261656 the legislation would do away with a secret ballot in so called organizing elections
9261657 a school like lima central catholic benefits by playing these elite schools from around the state
9261658 hopefully the girls will see what they need to do to succeed and it gives them some scores to shoot for hopefully they can set some goals they can strive for
9261659 this is a good tournament especially for the smaller schools like us because we have to go to columbus and toledo a lot and were playing d i schools
9261660 this is a nice one because it has a lot of the d ii schools from around here
9261661 i actually think there is a little bit more pressure on us when its in your town because a lot of people are out here follow it
9261662 its fun to play with more schools because you can get more experience it was fun playing with pickerington and upper arlington in my group
9261663 i put away my driver and i used my 5 wood and got it down the middle and i kept using that
9261664 this is her first year playing golf and she got a bloody nose on no 4 and stuck with it
9261665 i dont think i could have done what sam did today she gutted it out and im proud of our whole team
9261666 you just have to think back to the 1980s when at one point in time 60 percent of us whether you were in a union or not couldnt find a construction project because money got really tight
9261667 youve got the perfect storm brewing again and i dont know with whats happened over the last eight years if whoever becomes president can turn it around
9261668 i would say the years 81 and 82 they were the worst ive seen since i started
9261669 all we hear from business leaders is we need to compete it used to be china now its vietnam or mexico we have to short our own to compete its just this endless cycle this race to the bottom and it serves no one but the businesses that profit from it
9261670 this is the first time that weve had an economic expansion that the middle class hasnt benefited from it
9261671 all we hear is push push push so that you can compete with china or whoevers on top at the time but whats this doing to the standard of living in this country
9261672 in the last 25 years weve offered as a country and a state a lot of money to other countries japan korea and others to come over and set up shop
9261673 i dont know if you know this but there are no ford plants or chrysler plants of general motors plants in japan we call it isolationism here but in japan its just kind of the way it is
9261674 im optimistic things are going to start changing on nov 4
9261675 when we look at the last eight years ive had an underlying attitude of ticked off since 2000 its time for something different
9261676 if you ask me what scares me more than anything its to have someone standing up there waving his arms in front of the american flag and saying hes a fiscal conservative fiscal conservatives have run the highest deficits of anybody
9261677 you look at these guys who have called themselves fiscal conservatives its been like setting money on fire
9261678 i think when you have unregulated business like weve had the past 30 years thats when things start going downhill
9261679 i dont believe in unregulated business anymore than i think you can have unregulated labor but youve got to have a balance i dont believe weve had that in quite some time
9261680 the labor movement started in this country because people were being wronged they were sick of the pain and suffering
9261681 the direction were going in now its just a matter of time well have people marching in the street
9261682 i think were going to take a hit a few more times all our jobs are being sent out of the country so its bound to happen
9261683 but i think eventually people are going to have enough and labor will be there
9261684 we got repelled we didnt get beat well never admit that but we did get repelled
9261685 theyve worked really hard in the off season and it showed today theres a long season ahead but were off to a good start
9261686 this is the best team ive had since the 1970s when a group of boys went to state
9261687 ive been waiting 30 years for a team like this we have six solid runners we just need to continue to work hard
9261688 the bottom line is that there is no funding gap in the delivery of the games
9261689 it doesnt help things when the chancellor starts saying that the economy is down the tubes especially when the prime minister just so happens to have been looking after it for the last 10 years
9261690 i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9261691 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9261692 in 10 months weve gone from doing ok to certainly not doing ok people are pissed off
9261693 scotlands economy is showing real resilience in what are challenging times and mr darlings ridiculous interview is in danger of dragging everyone down to the labour partys own level
9261694 rise to the challenge of campaigning in his own backyard
9261695 the scottish government are funding 80 of the games and glasgow city council 20 with no contribution from westminster so it is entirely reasonable that lottery funding is restored to scotland to help boost the legacy investment
9261696 the funding is in place for the games but the legacy of the games is more important in many ways than the games themselves and we need the funding in place to make sure we maximise the games potential
9261697 glasgows east end is one of the most deprived areas of the country it not only needs this extra funding it deserves it
9261698 the legacy that we are talking about for the london olympics in 2012 is matched by the need for a legacy for glasgows games in 2014 the commonwealth games organisers have done a lot already but more funding is needed to mark that legacy
9261699 one of the most exciting aspects of london 2012 and glasgow 2014 is the opportunity they present to regenerate sport across the country and deliver a sporting legacy for the future
9261700 glasgows candidate city file for the 2014 games set out the various revenue streams that were expected and this did not include any funding from the lottery
9261701 we have found the male programming window which occurs far earlier in foetal development than was previously thought before the reproductive organs fully develop this is when the androgens such as testosterone in the foetus are at their most active
9261702 if the male foetus does not receive enough androgens it may not realise its full reproductive potential including the size of the penis and testes undescended testes or the sperm count the chances are something will be wrong with the reproductive system it may be one thing or several things
9261703 women could stop using body creams and perfumes although we do not have conclusive evidence that they do harm there are components about which there are question marks for example it could be certain combinations of chemicals if you are thinking about how a baby might be exposed thats one way and its something positive you can do it might have no consequence but its something positive women can do for their baby
9261704 a lot of women will not even know they are pregnant at this stage or how far along they are i would be very concerned about alarming women until these tests have been done on humans we welcome any new research in infertility but we would like to see a lot more research in this area before the findings on animals can be said for humans
9261705 this is new guidance for ministerial offices in responding to correspondence on reserved issues clearly on a number of subjects reserved to westminster including international affairs and trident nuclear weapons the scottish government has a different position from the uk administration and one more in tune with the majority of people in scotland
9261706 alex salmond fundamentally has no respect for devolution the devolution divide has been backed by the people of scotland who have voted for it that means that the people of scotland want westminster to do some things and the scottish government to do other things we respect that but he has contempt for it
9261707 i dont know on what basis they can produce a scottish government view on these areas
9261708 arizona is changing it used to be a more reliably republican state but as people have come in from other states they have taken their politics with them mccain has the same problem with republicans in arizona as he has with republicans in the rest of the country
9261709 he is conservative enough on social and foreign policy and some economic policy to appeal to those elements while also deploying the occasional liberal view which appeals to independents and undecideds
9261710 if you cross him he doesnt forget hes like an elephant
9261711 but he is just as famous for his showy acts of conciliation luxurious gift baskets saying im sorry i blew up at you
9261712 a large part of him and his appeal is that he feels he can talk himself out of anything and he is notoriously fearless when challenged
9261713 at least i dont plaster on the make up like a trollop you c
9261714 i think he is mentally unstable and not fit to be president
9261715 when are we going to send an airmail message to tehran
9261716 listen pal i spent 22 years in the navy my father was in the navy my grandfather was in the navy we in the military service tend to move a lot we have to live in all parts of the country all parts of the world i wish i could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of arizona but i was doing other things as a matter of fact when i think about it now the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi
9261717 for a politician mccain sure talks a lot of sense i admire him he has life experience and he speaks out for what he believes in
9261718 i wouldnt vote for obama no way hes a muslim
9261719 if we feel or if the organization feels that theres enough talent then i dont have a problem with that
9261720 you have to weigh the other issues involved as far as whos experienced enough to give you a good chance and does that outweigh the talent that youre hopefully bringing in
9261721 you have to make that decision and for me it matters but its really one of those decisions that you have to rely on the entire organization it wouldnt be right for me to say i want this or that
9261722 theyve seen it for an extended period of time and they evaluate just like everybody else
9261723 it did remind me of 45 years ago that was big not quite martin hes good but he aint martin hes not quite martin now lets not get confused here thats not martin martin is a whole different level
9261724 if we feel or if the organization feels that theres enough talent then i dont have a problem with that
9261725 you have to weigh the other issues involved as far as whos experienced enough to give you a good chance and does that outweigh the talent that youre hopefully bringing in
9261726 you have to make that decision and for me it matters but its really one of those decisions that you have to rely on the entire organization it wouldnt be right for me to say i want this or that
9261727 theyve seen it for an extended period of time and they evaluate just like everybody else
9261728 it did remind me of 45 years ago that was big not quite martin hes good but he aint martin hes not quite martin now lets not get confused here thats not martin martin is a whole different level
9261729 understanding the impact of firewalls and nats is the necessary first step when analyzing planning and addressing network traversal challenges
9261730 users expect services with high reliability excellent quality of service qos and security solutions that fail due to changing and unknown network topologies are at a clear disadvantage in the market place
9261731 through pane organizations reduce deployment risk and improve end users experiences
9261732 digital marketing is new territory for careers amp jobs and before embarking on such a programme we reviewed the major seo market players the combination of lbi netranks technical know how account management product offering and impressive client portfolio we believe far out shone that of their competition we really look forward to reaping the benefits of working with lbi netrank and enjoying a consequent increase in business
9261733 it is an exciting and challenging opportunity for lbi netrank to enter into the recruitment market to support careers amp jobs in what is a hugely competitive field in this period of economic downturn roi is king so we look forward to demonstrating how seo remains the most cost effective marketing medium
9261734 semantic technology is increasingly finding its way into real world applications estc2008 aims to make the experience and learning of organisations speaking at the event available to others to explain the business benefits and to accelerate the uptake of this important new technology
9261735 estc is a premium event as it draws the best and the brightest in the european semantic technology community including researchers vendors and users the programme clearly shows how the technology is coming out of the lab and into the enterprise where its impact will be profound and exciting
9261736 in the first half of 2008 the home entertainment industry saw a substantial increase in high definition software sales deg europe estimates that despite the economic slow down software sales increased six fold in units and five fold in value across europe further driving growth expectations for next generation disk sales
9261737 despite tough economic times the figures clearly demonstrate a strong desire amongst consumers to adopt new technologies and deg europe is hopeful that consumers continue to embrace next generation technologies as they continue to evolve
9261738 in todays media environment it is vital that businesses communicate online and companies that choose to ignore this are running a major risk traditional pr tactics are not going to go away anytime soon but it is essential for companies to integrate online pr and social media into their existing offline communications strategies
9261739 despite finding that an increasing number of uk pr professionals are on the ball when it comes to online pr this survey confirms our experience that a high proportion are still more focused on traditional media however given that this is most probably a reflection of client budget and resource allocations perhaps what we should be asking ourselves is what this says about uk business attitude towards online communications
9261740 while customers are already familiar with ninjaprobes wire speed traffic capture capabilities our addition of synchronized traffic replay even across multiple probes adds a new dimension to network monitoring and trouble shooting
9261741 after precisely time stamping every captured packet ninjaprobe can now accurately replay stored data while maintaining inter packet delay intervals guaranteeing recreation of the originally monitored traffic
9261742 high volume data storage coupled to accurate data replay is the equivalent of network cctv giving operators the reassurance that they can readily share a previous user experience and quickly isolate issues that might be impacting network performance
9261743 its like a restaurant implying that they serve food and then only listing the word food on every line of their menu
9261744 you really shouldnt have used that bronze colour as a ground
9261745 what were you thinking trying to get the paint to show on top of the photo of columns it looks like crap
9261746 shut up right now i am creating ill deal with you later
9261747 lester r brown reviews our global resource situation and provides strategic action plans to start to rectify our use of our global resources
9261748 were talking in the neighborhood of about 36 37 million gallons a day of waste
9261749 its used to fertilize or used as a soil amendment on pine trees to increase the yield he gets in his forestry
9261750 he stepped up and kept us in the game and thats the way a senior leader has to play he just played unbelievable
9261751 he did it all he ran the ball kick returned caught the ball he did pretty much anything i dont know what he didnt do throw a pass but he probably could have if we let him do it
9261752 hes one of the main reasons why we won this game
9261753 i just saw the goal line and the dude just made a great tackle hit my feet and then my feet collided with the other one my eyes got real big but when he hit my feet i just crumbled over i was mad
9261754 one of the magic things about the shelby ham fest is that many people meet for the first time face to face and a lot of times theyve been talking for years and years
9261755 its a family reunion of sorts and im really glad im here
9261756 the farthest ive talked with people is germany argentina or chile
9261757 he has the power and the strength to turn this country around
9261758 you live in a state that matters you have a chance to actually change history there is no way that we can win this election unless we win ohio
9261759 i think he really understands the need for change the need for improving our performance as a nation
9261760 he understands what a great country this is but also how much work we have to do to live up to what we stand for
9261761 we are in a really dangerous time in this country right now its frightening when you look at the economy and the state of health care and the state of education
9261762 the country really can and should be doing better than it is
9261763 it is an interesting choice for me because there are so many smarter more experienced more empowered more equipped republican women
9261764 it seems like a shallow choice a choice made out of tokenism
9261765 my message is to make sure you are seizing the day and participating in the democratic process so that years from now you can look back and be proud that you contributed to the most important change in the evolution of america
9261766 they are taking charge of their own futures instead of letting others decide
9261767 a nefarious conspiracy of the indian government and the states governor administration is behind the baseless and deplorable report aimed at diluting the mounting internal and external pressure in the context of the use of force on peaceful mass rallies and demonstrations in kashmir
9261768 the indian forces killed innocent people in unprovoked firing and on the other hand attempts are on to give a communal colour to the genuine struggle of the kashmiri people
9261769 this is a tactic to justify the attacks on the muslim minority in jammu the razing of their habitations and compelling them to migrate by communal hindu parties
9261770 the statement is of a piece with the conspiracy under which governor jagmohan lured kashmiri pandits out of the valley and rendered them homeless and is an attempt at dividing kashmiris on religious and regional lines
9261771 it is because of this that the indian government and its agencies are making a desperate bid to tear kashmirs communal harmony and religious tolerance to shreds
9261772 the jehadi leadership has ordered militants not to harass members of the minority communities but to safeguard their life and property
9261773 we are not a group just a bunch of young professionals who have friends in the valley who are suffering because of the curfew we wanted to let people here in mumbai know about their plight
9261774 we fell in love with the overwhelming stillness exuberance clarity and amplified sensory awareness of sanskrit poetry which we have attempted to share with you in this record
9261775 i was fortunate to be in mile high stadium last night to watch and listen to sen obama s historic speech as he accepted the democratic nomination for president of the united states
9261776 it was very significant that sen obama directly addressed the gun violence issue in our country he decided to strike a balance between rights and responsibilities and showed how we can have common sense gun laws in america to protect our families and communities
9261777 since the supreme court issued its opinion on the meaning of the second amendment the debate over gun laws in america has moved to the middle ground now common sense gun laws that save lives and protect police can be debated on their merits
9261778 america wants sensible restrictions on the easy access to dangerous weapons and sen obama clearly recognized that last night
9261779 ive noticed many things that are wrong with the current administration ive wondered for years why someone didnt step forward and fix it
9261780 during the current sheriffs administration its totally unacceptable to me they have a lack of direction through proper procedures
9261781 its not just things like neighborhood watches its much bigger than that its getting the community involved in some of the decision making at the sheriffs office i dont think the sheriff should be the king he should be a participant
9261782 i was recently quoted that being a politician was one of the most important things in being a sheriff thats not what i said what i said was a sheriff he or she needs to be a police officer because i see that as i viable asset but also a very good business person and i will tell you as a business person my business is very successful
9261783 its like the end of the year the final show and its a nice accomplishment to get here and stuff so many people qualify to go
9261784 every sunday we completely empty out their stalls every night theres feeding every morning theres feeding
9261785 then on the weekends instead of going off and goofing off like most kids its working with the horses and its a lot of responsibility to have a horse
9261786 they have to be able to put themselves into a schedule and keep a schedule and you know as you get older and get into the working force with families and kids and a job thats all part of growing up and its a great learning experience for these kids
9261787 so much of the time you sit back and theres nothing you can do things happen across the world whatever this is something that ive found that im able to do
9261788 the love guru starring mike myers ridicules hinduism its concepts and terminology hindu groups and other religious people the world over led by acclaimed hindu leader rajan zed have been protesting it since march they have later boycotted this movie resulting in its blatant failure at the box office this film has hurt the feelings of the hindu community worldwide we request you to understand the pain of worldwide hindus and other spiritual people we request you to refuse to handle sell rent the dvds of the love guru
9261789 will most certainly go down in history as one of the worst movies ever made
9261790 this is the time of year you want to be playing your best baseball anyway
9261791 whether youre playing one of the better teams or one of the teams at the bottom if their pitcher is on that night it could be a tough game
9261792 this is the time of year you want to be playing your best baseball anyway
9261793 whether youre playing one of the better teams or one of the teams at the bottom if their pitcher is on that night it could be a tough game
9261794 im sorry matt i could have sworn you would be able to succeed at at least one exercise but i cant keep you enrolled in this class any longer if you cant manifest a single talent
9261795 im sorry you do have some latent talent lurking deep within you that much i can sense sometimes it just stays that way other times it may emerge at a later time through trauma or gradually
9261796 you can come back and enroll again if your talent manifests ill even be willing to teach you personally
9261797 i guess he was right you have been through a lot the turning always is a big shock to the system
9261798 no not just that i meant this us this whole weekend
9261799 what do you think god youre so damn sexy i i um was half way hoping you would ask me out instead of the others in the common room
9261800 thats really sweet i did hope you wouldnt find anyone else either
9261801 really i didnt know why i was so attracted to you at first at least that strongly was was that because of you or
9261802 um you know how mates for life happens with wolves occasionally its a little similar to us but um i believe you somehow knew i was the one but you didnt know why or what the feeling was
9261803 nothing that fantastical it just means were practically compatiable physically and emotionally the rest we could probably argue until the end of time if we disagree on anything in the future
9261804 i see is that why you smell so attractive even now something like cinnamon and musk
9261805 ah that you have that scent all over you as well other weres can smell my natural scent but not this unique odor because thats how weres identify their mates
9261806 i really didnt sign up for a long term relationship but
9261807 as i promised earlier we can take as long as you need to decide and also decide the terms of our relationship but i want to enjoy your company for the rest of the weekend so no more thinking
9261808 what do you expect hon we fucked each others brains out till about three in the morning
9261809 and you were hornier than hell last night i almost couldnt keep up with you fucking me
9261810 i i really should go i have to work early in the morning
9261811 no you never have to leave if you dont want to
9261812 ill go rummage in the kitchen and find something close the door will you
9261813 after examining the shells it was found that they were of the same sort of shells that were used in the suicide attack launched at the central security complex in sayoun on july 25 and were the same kind of explosives found in the hide out of tarim cell
9261814 while we were preparing to leave for lunch the concrete fall down making a big blow i jumped out and screamed
9261815 the contractor is from the same tribe of the owner of the building who is a well known businessman
9261816 even though it is john mccains 72nd birthday it looks like barack obama and joe biden got the best gift with mccains choice of sarah palin to be mccains running mate
9261817 governor palins lack of experience and thin record give us no choice but to return to the clear facts that john mccain has a long and terrible record of failing americas workers
9261818 thats why change to win members are so excited about the obama biden ticket were in our sixth month of backing a candidate who has the vision and leadership to make real change for all of americas working families obama had the wisdom to pick a partner with over 30 years of experience in foreign affairs and who has always stood on the side of workers in the fight for good jobs retirement with dignity and the opportunity to leave a better life for their children that is why we are proud and excited to continue to knock on thousands of doors visit thousands of worksites and make millions of phone calls to educate our members and turn out an historic vote this november

9261847 this quarantine is designed to keep the moths from moving out of the area
9261848 it is a necessary step so that we can contain and eventually eradicate this pest from california and to protect the rest of the state from added quarantines and increased pesticide use over the long term
9261849 seeing phil and john as hardened criminals working on the other side of the law will no doubt take devoted life on mars fans by surprise joining them as the other two jewel thieves in their crew are ashley walters and cristian solimeno and the dynamic between all four actors is terrific to watch weve a great ensemble cast with kate magowan and dylan brown along with kevin mcnally kirsty mitchell and linal haft

9261852 each dollar is important and will take us closer to our goal
9261853 i think this community will rally because everybody knows how tough it is
9261854 if one is in trouble it affects all of us
9261855 we know the economys difficult but we have made so much progress in those areas
9261856 it has to be obtainable without those dollars we cant continue the progress weve made

9261866 secure computing gets a blog 3 years after i wanted one
9261867 i had such a full exciting and rich life as a student and as a young adult because of dance we trained traveled and performed around the world i feel i have been blessed by all the success as well as the disappointing experiences as a dancer
9261868 i owe a lot to my very first teacher tita radaic who passed on her passion dedication and respect for dance i learned the discipline from her i also am very blessed to have had such a professional and creative artistic director in my professional years with ballet philippines
9261869 any one who runs their own business would say that the work is 24 hours a day it is the same with running a performing arts school you are continually on the edge of your seat creating new works as a choreographer hiring teachers to replace the good ones who had to move on letting go of teachers who have not delivered well promoting students who deserve and having to deal with parents who do not agree with your decisions so forth and so on
9261870 i have learned to take it all objectively and because of all the human interaction the business has fortunately allowed me to have i have learned so much about people relationships life and so much about myself as well
9261871 follow your heart and do not give up when you are true to your goal and true to yourself everything in the universe will work together to make sure you reach your destination the journey may not be easy but the rewards will be beyond your imagination
9261872 is this saints saints or what the roman church means by saints
9261873 and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do
9261874 for whosoever shall do the will of my father which is in heaven the same is my brother and sister and mother
9261875 whosoever shall do the will of christs father which is in heaven the same is his brother and sister
9261876 i think you may be attempting to fight a war that no one else is waging at the moment
9261877 in heaven the saints will want what god wants an god will want what the saints want
9261878 ive had enough kidnapping corrupt police a rotten judicial system
9261879 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive maybe nothing like this has happened to them or they would be more sensitive
9261880 the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities their insensitivity
9261881 i have often asked myself why why me why my daughter
9261882 for my birthday three days after the operation my boyfriend took me out for dinner and i ate a whole plate of pasta and a chocolate cake for dessert
9261883 people did think i had an eating disorder but i was just never hungry my parents were constantly getting on at me to eat but if i ate a lot one day for example going out for a meal with friends i could go the whole day without food
9261884 it never crossed my mind a lack of appetite was just normal
9261885 when i fell ill it was really worrying because at first the doctors did not know what the growth was
9261886 my case was so unusual they werent sure at first how they were going to treat it
9261887 i am so glad they were able to do the keyhole surgery and leave half of my spleen it has made such a difference to my life it means i dont have to take antibiotics every day for the rest of my life and i dont have a big scar which means i can wear a bikini on the beach and not worry about it i am also enjoying my food again i now know what it feels like to be hungry and to feel full
9261888 in nadines case this large cyst was causing significant compression on her stomach she was probably born with it and when it got larger as she grew it caused trouble
9261889 this is an advanced and extremely specialised procedure for benign conditions in children or young people in which the spleen is still crucial in fighting infections that can otherwise become lethal
9261890 this is a very rare operation and we were delighted to have successfully performed it by minimal invasive surgery and to have avoided a total splenectomy to the best of my knowledge i am not aware that any similar procedure where half the spleen is removed rather than the whole has been performed before through keyhole surgery in the uk

9261898 when the storm hits we can move right into the areas and go right to work
9261899 when you think about the ripple effect of the hotel rooms the restaurants its in the hundreds of millions
9261900 you cannot underestimate at least the initial impact these storms can have not only on the industry but in the price of oil as well
9261901 once you get there and youre walking the streets its just blocks and blocks of houses are gone theres nothing left its hard to comprehend hopefully we dont see anything like that again
9261902 the rescue guys walked 12 hours a day in the mud looking for people you just do what you got to do
9261903 breaking down doors making sure people out of there possibly collapses shore up buildings if we have to get in there to make a search we have listening devices and search cams to look inside well be able to do a lot of things

9261905 just teaching people to become a grant writer is only part of the challenge
9261906 the list of all these categories is huge 1 300 or 1 400 fields of interest
9261907 i try to make that process as simple as possible
9261908 as society is changing our library is adapting to be part of it
9261909 i had nothing for him he must have had a problem to give us that second shot one of my goals this year was to beat jason shaw but i never dreamed it would be for the win this is awesome
9261910 they hired reed sorenson for next year so its over
9261911 theyre working on a fourth team and looking for sponsorship but you know how that goes
9261912 he hasnt shown any signs of letting up but well be right there in case he does
9261913 no way im going to need every race we have to catch steckly
9261914 we won the two events but steckly finished just behind so were not picking up as much ground as id like
9261915 steckly has just been so good all season but were not quitting
9261916 i know were not supposed to look ahead and think like this but were trying to win this championship we have to aware of the guys with nothing to lose
9261917 hes not in the points race hes out here to win races just like he should be but were not willing to take those same chances right now
9261918 i know that sounds wrong but thats just how it is
9261919 we gave away too many points on the road courses
9261920 whether it was an accident or a mechanical failure of some type some were our fault and others werent thats the way it goes in racing but we need to change that trend
9261921 we made our move last year starting with the win in the second cayuga race and it set the tone for the rest of the season for the team
9261922 our setups and preparation were good we felt very comfortable with what we had learned throughout the year and they are all tracks where our strengths play out well
9261923 to race in the nascar nationwide series is a new challenge for me and a great opportunity to kick my nascar career in high gear i know how much this opportunity means and i will do everything i can to earn my place here
9261924 i think hell do fine with the speeds and the tracks considering where he came from but he will have to adjust to the car itself and the level of competition
9261925 its great that he got this opportunity and he wont be the last there are a lot of great racers in canada
9261926 i am my share of bad luck here at the first event of the year i will not let myself be surprised again i am increasingly comfortable of oval tracks and i am confident that i can do well here this weekend
9261927 without the accident in trois rivi res i could have won that race the car was quick if we find the right set up and the car holds together i can aim for a top 5 finish
9261928 our members and retirees at arcelormittal now have the opportunity to enjoy the employment security economic security and retirement security they earned through years of hard work and sacrifice
9261929 these members unwavering long term solidarity and support for our bargaining committee has been rewarded
9261930 we believe that ratification of the proposed agreement is a major step toward raising the industry standard in wages benefits and other contractual protections without sacrificing the long term viability of arcelormittal in a competitive market
9261931 id like to thank our local union leadership for their unwavering solidarity
9261932 our support staff and headquarters technicians for their talent and dedication and most of all our members and retirees for their commitment to keeping our proud traditions of union activism and steelmaking alive in their communities for over 100 years
9261933 we know that many of these plants would have been shut down years ago if not for the leadership role these men and women assumed when the time came to restructure and consolidate the steel industry in north america
9261934 there has to be some rationality behind the continuous increase in carriage fees however the court is not deciding to frame regulation
9261935 the ministry has not yet received a notice regarding this
9261936 i ended up losing the brakes around lap 30 a caliper line broke then i guess i got impatient and tried to knock a nose wing off i was holding on and praying that timmy and those guys werent going to come and get me i have really been pushing for this race for a long time after i won three in a row and then just couldnt seem to do it again tonight despite the hole in the oil pan and the brakes i think i could have finished on three wheels and won it was a great car it ran perfect for all the faults it still handled great im so lucky to be in the car we have great motors from r amp r great sponsors like ed shea perleys marina and nemrs and vic miller putting the car together then there is the crew scotty leo mike phil curtis freddy everybody and of course thanks to our families for letting us all do this
9261937 getting a caution is no guarantee because getting behind him doesnt mean a whole lot look at the lap he put down in practice chris beat my track record and he beat me in the feature hats off to them they are a bunch of good guys and hes a good winner
9261938 we started toward the back i was pretty good at the start the car just went away with ten laps to go i was just hanging on id like to congratulate perley you come to expect this from the 11 car timmy did a good job were looking forward to tomorrow this was fun there are a lot of fast fast cars that run here the 8 was fast the 7 was fast but he looked like he faded were fast the 11 is fast my crew is great we did break a driveshaft in the heat and steve and the group do a tremendous job id like to thank them all its just a fun race to run
9261939 the car was pretty loose at the beginning with the fuel load when that burned away it got better and it was pretty good at the end i just needed 75 laps instead of 50 id really like to thank the crew for doing so much work and my sponsors who have been great this year running isma is really tough and everybody has stepped up i just couldnt do it without them
9261940 we were too good too early the car was good from the drop of the green i got by those guys and out into the clean air but on lap 14 it started getting a little free then i had some trouble with a lap car and got tangled up with him a little bit the caution came out and then when we went back to green it just never was as good as it was at the beginning toward the end we were just hanging on to see what we could salvage for the night its all in one piece and well carry on for tomorrow
9261941 were preparing for the worst and hoping for the best
9261942 i think this will be very different in that perhaps the people that are coming to us will be better prepared to have left their homes we hope so
9261943 but its also going to be really hard for them to watch whats happening if in fact their homes are destroyed in front of their eyes
9261944 we kind of have a little experience under our belt from our last time through this so we sort of know the drill and hopefully well be able to focus on helping the folks as they come
9261945 when we have a chance to respond we will do it
9261946 thats one of the things that katrina taught us if we are prepared for disaster god forbid disaster comes but if we are prepared we can mobilize quickly we can be ready to serve at the drop of a hat
9261947 the spirit of knoxville and the spirit of this church and the many of the other people that are partnering throughout our community is about saying we have open doors and open hearts no matter what you need we are ready at the drop of a hat to provide not only a good safe place but a welcoming warm place
9261948 it was a bit of a surprise but after looking into her credentials with her being a social conservative pro life a working mother from a working class background with a lot of executive experience as a mayor and governor i find it a refreshing departure from politics as usual
9261949 mccains choice of palin still resounds of conservatism but a new type of conservatism i think the new word would be progressive conservatism were moving toward perhaps a new republican party
9261950 i think shell bring strength to the ticket in terms of her conservative credentials
9261951 shes female she comes from a state which has been the site of controversy over oil drilling in environmentally protected areas and has a pro drilling stance id say i was surprised at her selection but really pleased
9261952 i think it was a bold choice gov palin is a proven leader who has strong values and will bring a new level of energy to the campaign moreover she is a reformer who will work with john mccain to fix washington and address issues like enhancing our competitiveness in the global economy reducing energy costs and making health care more affordable
9261953 she brings a younger perspective a womans perspective and she seems to complement john very well i dont think we needed more of the old politics she brings a new perspective alaska is about as far away from washington as you can get this is progressive she is a lot of things that mccain is not she has the whole package from what i see
9261954 weve got the republican national convention coming up so why not start the buzz early plus with an announcement like this with all the word of mouth its free advertising were capitalizing on this will generate tremendous support for our party its exciting times tough times yet exciting times
9261955 it is interesting that the democrats were so supportive of sen
9261956 we have the equipment and the volunteers and i feel it is the right thing to do
9261957 the same two teams wanted the thing just as badly the whole time while both going through adversity
9261958 i told the officials before the game that they were going to see an emotionally charged game and thats what it was
9261959 it wasnt pretty at times but im just so proud of our team for sticking with it we hadnt sucked it up and won a football game like this in my three years here weve had some big wins but never one that was back and forth until the end like this
9261960 and by far the greatest accomplishment ive been a part in waynedale football
9261961 i ignored all the pressure and talk when doctors said nofsinger couldnt play and worried about the task at hand my linemen did a great job and everyone came up big for us
9261962 we felt that play gave us the best chance to win at that point
9261963 he made some big throws and that was a tremendous play in overtime to read the defense and find cory
9261964 it was a great effort by waynedale and our team
9261965 im proud of the way our kids kept fighting unfortunately it just didnt turn out the way we wanted it to
9261966 that is going to have an impact on the entire community
9261967 its hard to cover someone for 6 to 10 seconds but besancons such a potent runner you have to respect his legs and someone came off their coverage
9261968 we did a nice job of giving up yards but no points
9261969 but they ran it better than we did their quarterback is good and their line did a good job in the first half
9261970 but we tightened some things up in the interior of the line in the second half and that allowed our linebackers to make more plays
9261971 for the most part i thought we were catching them in the first half and not attacking and i thought we were a lot better attacking in the second half
9261972 we had great balance and mixed it up in the first half
9261973 hats off to orrville obviously they made adjustments at halftime and shut us down we werent able to counter and the turnovers certainly didnt help
9261974 really it was a bad decision on my part to kick it to pittman at the end of the half because we should have put it on the ground that was huge because they get that score get momentum on their side
9261975 wed like to make the fourth quarter our quarter and we did tonight
9261976 but we cant keep relying on our athletes to just outrun and outjump people
9261977 youve got to give coach haas and triway a lot of credit they played their tails off but weve got to keep getting better
9261978 those orrville kids they just know how to win and thats the level were trying to get to
9261979 but now that were facing a little adversity well see how we bounce back and what were made of
9261980 in a way i was mad but in a way it made sense
9261981 i think its going to hurt cincinnati more than its going to hurt the bengals
9261982 he came out of college as an old senior a redshirt
9261983 and chris perry chris perry is younger hes i have confidence in chris perry
9261984 it makes you wonder whats going on in the front office
9261985 everybodys gotta go out there and they gotta do their jobs
9261986 and if you cant do your jobs you gotta put somebody there that can do it i mean regardless of how its going to impact the fans or whatever
9261987 the telluride film festival represents the rarest jewel in the crown of the festival going experience it is the most open democratic and collegial of festivals in addition to being one of the best programmed and run
9261988 there could not have been a better place for me to start my journey of showing the film it is an intimate film lovers festival and here i will know how it resonates with the audiences the bar is very high here with the likes of mike leigh and david fincher showing their films and also films that were awarded in cannes so in many ways this is a good beginning to the litmus test
9261989 oh man what a lap we struggled a little bit today we just couldnt get the speed out of the car and we were a little frustrated with practice because obviously having pepsi onboard for the pepsi 500 is a big deal but we ran so well here earlier in the year and we feel like weve made gains since then and were shaking our heads a little bit we made some adjustments i thought steve letarte made some great calls we sat up in the trailer and debriefed after practice and came up with a game plan and it really paid off i think the track came to us a little bit and now looking back on it i feel like we had a car that was good enough to possibly match jimmies johnson lap had we had it a little closer in practice i think we could have challenged him i gave up a lot down in turn 1 i just didnt want to overdrive it and the car was awesome in turns 3 and 4 not that we could have beaten him but i feel like we could have been real close to him but to be third im ecstatic
9261990 katrina was always the first choice for nakshatra as she has the perfect brand attributes which are in synergy with nakshatra that signifies success and an achiever bent of mind and katrina is the epitome of success
9261991 back to back race weekends on opposite coasts put us under a bit of pressure commented team principal ian willis
9261992 we took an extra day in sonoma to prep the car before sending the hauler straight to new jersey and the team arrived at thunderbolt early wednesday to get the car ready for practice the next day being a new track we needed to do a track walk with the drivers and engineers before we could come up with ideas for setup well get that setup on the car tonight and spend the first session sorting out the details
9261993 bhangoo brings with him a unique combination of international tv experience coupled with a good understanding of programming to the south asian community he has proven creative leadership and in his last position was the only asian to occupy such a senior position at the bbc uk leading a team of senior talent he has been responsible for creating and commissioning content for the asian programming unit of bbc
9261994 the set role is particularly interesting for me because it gives me a challenging opportunity to generate big impact entertainment programming for the indian market a country that i have a strong connect with thanks to my roots and my experience at the bbc india is currently among the hottest markets to be in and the tv space is no different im also excited to work with an innovative network owned and backed by spti
9261995 i couldnt give my all today because of my left hand i was turning into the pits with just one hand on the steering wheel and was unable to do my best
9261996 the track is bumpy and it was really hard on my hand i hate having to miss a race but i prefer leaving the car to alex tagliani this weekend while i rest up my hand in order for it to get better
9261997 its unfortunate what happened to enrique in sonoma last week and that its causing him to miss this weeks race
9261998 on the other hand im happy to be welcoming alex into the team this weekend obviously it will be a big challenge for him as he will not get that much time in the car before the race but alex has a lot of experience especially on street courses and hes raced here in the past as well i think he will be able to adapt quickly to his new racing environment and it will be interesting to see how he does this weekend
9261999 i cant explain just how happy i am to be helping conquest racing this weekend and to get my first start in the indycar series
9262000 this will be a great opportunity for me to show what i can do im aware that it will not be easy for me coming in at the last minute and learning a new car in a new racing series but im definitely motivated on doing my best and helping conquest this weekend
9262001 i knew i had to protect the bottom so i actually had to slow down in the corners so i could go faster to hold him off
9262002 he left the door open a couple of times but i didnt want to push the issue and ruin both our nights
9262003 if he had given me a bigger window i might have tried to make a pass
9262004 but dont take anything away from eric he had a great night he deserved to win
9262005 weve had what 10 race nights and weve had four seconds in features and five dnfs weve had broken axels dead batteries all kinds of stuff out of our control
9262006 we were having a problem with the pickup on restarts so the cautions were hurting us but once we got rolling we were fine
9262007 it was all in fun we were in the cars just howling
9262008 did you see the way the fans were screaming they loved it
9262009 i kept getting held up and held up and held up in traffic
9262010 i tried to be patient but it wasnt working it was time to go
9262011 surely we have some things we could be doing that are more important to higher education and our students than this discussion
9262012 theres a better way for our country and state by state to deal with alcohol related issues for young people
9262013 we believe that we ought to be open to explorations of alternatives to try to get a better understanding of those alternatives
9262014 thats the first step getting people to realize we have a serious problem
9262015 the techniques and laws we have are failing once you can get people to realize that you can push for longer term action
9262016 for the student who chooses to binge drink all of a sudden were making that more accessible easier and permissible
9262017 does that mean theres going to be less of that i dont think so
9262018 thats like another view in raising kids the argument that you should give kids alcohol at home so theyre not out there drinking
9262019 im sure theres validity to it but im not sure thats the answer to binge drinking i lean more on the side of education and teaching behaviors that would support a strong healthy solid lifestyle
9262020 if youre brought up in a household where alcohols not something to be feared you tend to come to college and have control over it
9262021 this office is going to do the best it can to do its duty to the people of this district and the victims families
9262022 when he got 99 years the general feeling at the time was that if you had killed a child or children that he would never survive prison
9262023 but then hes fallen through the cracks all his life
9262024 the normal case in a double murder would be that they are tried together
9262025 it doesnt make sense to impanel two separate juries and have two separate trials if there were two murders arising out of the same action
9262026 regrets that the file of edward mcgee has been destroyed
9262027 i decided i would give him the best representation i possibly could
9262028 thats one thing that really stood out in my mind to this day i cant answer why im not sure eddie could answer why
9262029 matt and hank are both guys that ive had a long relationship with both here and in new england ive known them a long time it was hard
9262030 all four guys have done positive things and i like all four guys
9262031 its unique its different but all four of them are guys that we like
9262032 overall we played very well as a team this weekend
9262033 weve got a lot we need to work on but we also have a lot of momentum we can build off of as we move forward with the season it was a great effort by all of our players this weekend as we are really starting to put some things together
9262034 it was a tough loss against etsu we really let game one go and just couldnt get that last side out
9262035 it was really frustrating from that stand point but the team responded really well in the face of adversity to take sets two and three unfortunately we let them get a little momentum in game four we played a very tight fifth game and it really could have gone either way but we just couldnt finish it off in the end
9262036 we played a very good east carolina squad this evening
9262037 we were really in that match and just couldnt get it done we would let it get away from us in the last few points of each set
9262038 taylor was one of our most consistent players all weekend
9262039 she made some great judgment calls running our offense and from a setting standpoint
9262040 i just hope he wont bring it back with a crooked frame
9262041 we are extremely grateful towards the association they supported us financially from the very beginning of this season and now they increase their help so that we can complete the championship its a pat on the back that encourages us a lot i will be able to finish this season at full throttle
9262042 its been over three years that we have been attempting to find the proper event to make this happen
9262043 we had what appeared to be electronic sensor issues during the two races at trois rivi res we have since isolated the issue to a leaky intercooler boot and the concerns should now be fully corrected
9262044 its a shame as we were on our way to a podium finish we would like to thank the great adex people for their involvement with the team at trois rivi res
9262045 we have in the past had the boy scouts go out there and during games use it for parking and all the benefits go to them
9262046 we didnt want to do that again this year until the city says its ok if the city allows it we can do it
9262047 if you charge for parking you will need a business license
9262048 and we will be out there enforcing this on the days that are designated and those that are not
9262049 we really didnt raise a stink for them at any point although the toilets were sitting there for 24 to 30 months were glad to see them go
9262050 ive had three people come over and ask me about our restaurant space
9262051 its expensive so its kind of a tough sell anyway but being expensive and hidden was not a good combination you can now tell what it is from the business college and i think thats making believers out of people
9262052 my problem is again im a developer and i understand that thats private property and if they say that hey come and throw your frisbee there and you twist your ankle theyre liable
9262053 ideally i would love to see it open to the public but i understand that it cant be so lets just say i hope they keep their grass cut
9262054 there were people in the community and on the commission who expressed concern when this project got stalled about the fence around the property
9262055 certainly it was tolerable when it was the precursor to a project there but it wasnt the best image for the community on one of our star corners
9262056 its basically the property owner doing us a favor by being a good public citizen and keeping the land maintained and cleaned
9262057 were waiting for the decision by the supreme court so we know whether we have the tiff tax increment financing money or not then well know whether we do the project as is or make modifications
9262058 i think everyone watches that project with great interest because its close to us
9262059 the university is always interested in what is happening around us and i think we will always keep our eye on that
9262060 people will starve if the situation is allowed to be what it is the education of children has already suffered much and we can ill afford to allow the situation to continue as it is
9262061 the entire kashmir civil society is feeling chocked and suffocated because of restrictions imposed on all peaceful ways and means of expressing disagreement and dissent this is in no case a healthy sign for peace and reconciliation the government should take all steps necessary for restoration of confidence
9262062 it was a pressure situation but once i saw where the ball was going to be placed down i was like thats closer than a normal pat
9262063 im a soccer player but the football team has taken me in as one of their own
9262064 john was counting on the 10 other guys out there
9262065 he was thanking them all after the game just like those other guys were thanking him
9262066 i thought the whole time were going to kick it ramsay said
9262067 we did have the momentum and we havent been real lucky going for two in the past i actually figured earlier we were going to overtime at 7 7 so now its 14 14 and im still thinking the same thing
9262068 it was just one of those games where somebody had to lose but nobody deserved to lose
9262069 i dont know if our guys thought we could just show up and that would be enough after our big one last week
9262070 i do know we preached all week about how good dalton is and they showed us a lot of good things tonight
9262071 theyve got more bodies to choose from than we do
9262072 were beating the same kids up play after play after play and theyre shuffling new guys in i guarantee weve got more guys going both ways and eventually it became kind of an attrition thing
9262073 that made a difference but you cant have the mistakes we had especially in key moments
9262074 the world knows well that the iranians have always been throughout their history an inspiring nation that has promoted culture literature arts humanity peace friendship and love in their neighborhood and beyond
9262075 wherever the iranians set their feet the works remained from their presence reminded the coming generations of humanity an exalted culture their artistic spirit and well matureness and for instance in tajikistan the iranian culture has captured the depth of the hearts of this nation
9262076 from the far east to the far west in latin america wherever the iranians have gone they have taken along the iranian kindness purity of soul and love for the entire mankind and contrary to the the negative propagation of the oppressive powers the memory of nations about the iranian nation has always been full of a good beautiful transparent and highly lovable image
9262077 today also due to the aggressive moves of the occupying and corrupt forces invasions here and there side by side with the resistance of the iranian nation irans name shines more than ever
9262078 today the hearts and minds of the world nations are with the iranians and the iranian culture because the iranian culture is a culture of monotheism justice seeking love peace friendship and equality of the entire human beings which is why we are both proud to be iranians and thank god for it
9262079 after the victory of the islamic revolution and after a long delay in iranian nationss inspiring of the world nations once again irans comprehensive move towards advancement began and today despite the big powers will and their broad scale negative propagation we are moving towards the peaks of advancement and pride
9262080 if a nation would achieve progress in scientific fields it can rapidly capture th peaks of success in all other fields and the iranian youth and technicians are fortunately capturing the peaks scientific success one after the other
9262081 the enemies imposed eight years of war followed by decades of sanctions against the iranian nation hoping to block the path of irans advancement assuming that they could halt the iranian nation and urge it to abandon its desire to remain independent and prestigious
9262082 the world knows well that the iranians have always been throughout their history an inspiring nation that has promoted culture
9262083 the humanitarian concerns resulting from the south ossetia conflict needs to be addressed urgently by both parties
9262084 the first half of 2008 has confirmed the long term trend by utilities to invest in projects to modernise and upgrade power transmission infrastructure
9262085 prysmian was able to meet this demand globally and can now rely on a solid order book ensuring high visibility on future sales growth the order book for submarine cables covers production capacity until the first half of 2010 while orders for high voltage underground cables already cover more than 50 of production capacity in 2009 recently we have also taken a strategic step forward signing an agreement with the oil company petrobras allowing us to expand our scope of operations into high tech high margin businesses and entering with a full range of products into the industry of services for the off shore oil drilling industry

9262088 i wanted to see him run unencumbered go through agility drills jumping drills the things players do you hope they dont limp or favor a leg he did not that was number one
9262089 on top of that i was impressed by what he did with his body to get in shape and get stronger it was obvious to me he had been in the weight room
9262090 here i am back in san antonio happy with the bronze medal we won at the games and ready to tackle a new season of the nba
9262091 a large body of available evidence indicates that currently marketed food contact materials containing bpa are safe and that exposure to bpa from food contact materials including exposures for infants and children are below the levels that may cause health effects
9262092 patrick ewing will have an opportunity here to compete for a spot on our roster
9262093 he is a solid defensive player and a very good athlete
9262094 exercise caution avoiding any demonstrations or large gatherings of people
9262095 scenes of crime officers have already carried out examinations at the various outhouses
9262096 kirstie is a charming popular and hard working girl with many friends all of whom are hoping she will be found safe and well
9262097 however the newspaper reports published today regarding the release of learco chindamo are entirely inaccurate
9262098 we fear he may well have already gone possibly to england or to another french port its also possible hes gone to belgium or the netherlands
9262099 conditions in the camp are very hard the occupants sole aim is to secure their passage to britain
9262100 you have to be very careful when entering these camps the people there mostly men have an illegal status they have no job and no home the jungle is a dangerous place and its not safe to go there
9262101 there were a lot of newcomers this year and that is one of the fun things about this race
9262102 we wanted to set a pace today that not everyone could take so we pushed the pace right away and as soon as it was the five of us we relaxed a little bit
9262103 it was really nice to be up there with aislinn allison sawyer and morgan everyone was feeling really comfortable
9262104 coach wetmore told us to run it like a workout and that is what i did i never felt uncomfortable or like i was going too hard
9262105 this is a wonderful program and they have done so much for me it the race just felt really good
9262106 we were all definitely out there and in it together
9262107 its such a great feeling i felt like this race meant so much more after missing the time trial and rocky mountain shootout last year since i was up there with everyone and they were all looking to me for leadership
9262108 one of my goals was to stay with the lead pack about halfway through i was getting a little worried but i stuck with it we have a pretty good crew this year the freshmen finished up with us and it was a good start to the season
9262109 the veterans on the womens side are where they need to be and a couple of freshmen looked pretty good too this is a long difficult course for high school girls since they run 5k the same goes for the high school men they also run 5k and this is an 8 000 meter race this is one of the harder courses there is so to see jonny stevens up there pretty high 12 th and joe bosshard 15 th and brett walters 3 rd is a perfect opener the veterans were where they needed to be
9262110 our policy is that only people with absolute perfect health run this race and so some of our veterans and some of the new people sat out some of the people missing will certainly be back
9262111 we played some good teams and the team really stepped up
9262112 i think the main thing is that we have confidence this year
9262113 it feels really good to come out of a tournament and win all three matches and to sweep those matches i think we are all just feeling very confident and are very excited to play the rest of our season
9262114 having the five seniors on the court has really helped the situation we have a ton of girls who have come in and have really stepped up confidence has been the key we all have the attitude of coming in and knowing that we are going to win the game
9262115 we kept the pressure on a really good team tonight msu
9262116 they are a big team pretty skilled but also young and so i think the pressure we kept on this all match caused them to break down in the end i think we had a lot of kids who played really well this weekend
9262117 they are desperate because of defeats in the northern front lines and are targeting civilians
9262118 weve named him as suspect based on an examination of facts and witness accounts
9262119 we need to acknowledge that womens participation in politics needs working
9262120 this exhibition indonesian women especially the younger generation will get to witness womens participation within the last century of our nations history
9262121 we need to show that women can look after trees like taking care of our offspring

9262126 e puliscono la cittadella medievale per il resto dellanno siamo abbandonati a noi stessi da otto mesi abbiamo chiesto al sindaco un incontro ma non ne abbiamo saputo nulla non chiedevamo nulla di particolare solo un p di pulizia e di attenzione seria per un monumento unico nel suo genere ma pare che il comune abbia altri interessi
9262127 nel nome della pace sia il sindaco di tutti faccia dunque il suo dovere e scenda in campo dando per primo lesempio di civilt o altrimenti faccia un passo indietro e se ne vada a casa con doveroso rispetto la saluto

9262140 i the prime minister have come to office in the appropriate way and i wont resign
9262141 i will not back down i will rule this country and will lead it through all of the problems
9262142 i have been very patient and have refrained from using force
9262143 many have criticized me for being too soft but if the government cracked down we would be criticized for using excessive force
9262144 the coalition partners have the impression that the situation is deteriorating and we are thinking of telling the prime minister to decide on the future of the government
9262145 we are grateful that grand cayman was spared major damage and that our residents are safe

9262148 were quite keen to explore another potential motive whether it was linked to some chinese organised crime groups targeting foreign students or young people in the uk

9262167 going into qualifying we werent sure if this thing would turn im amazed at how good it was
9262168 im delighted with the result everybody needed it at the club it was deserved against a good blackburn side
9262169 its disappointing we performed well but got nothing out of the game

9262189 es ist ein sch nes gef hl wieder auf der pole position zu stehen es war nicht einfach durch die vielen gelben flaggen und den verkehr auf der strecke eine schnelle runde zu fahren auf meiner schnellsten runde hatte ich einen quersteher dennoch reichte es zur pole position so ein ergebnis am sonntag w re perfekt
9262190 ich bin zufrieden mit startplatz zwei insbesondere da wir am freitag in den tests einige probleme hatten es ist sch n hier beim heimspiel so weit vorne zu stehen ich freue mich auf die unterst tzung der britischen fans
9262191 startplatz drei geht in ordnung besonders wenn man bedenkt dass diese strecke nicht zu meinen lieblingsstrecken geh rt wir hatten ein paar probleme im freien training im qualifying ist mir dann eine gute schnelle runde gelungen und nur das z hlt am sonntag wird es mit sicherheit ein enges und spannendes rennen geben
9262192 eine klasse leistung von timo wir alle wissen wie eng es in der dtm zugeht deshalb habe ich einen harten kampf an der spitze erwartet ich bin auch mit unserer teamleistung sehr zufrieden allerdings tut es mir um mattias ekstr m leid der in der zweiten session einen getriebeschaden an seinem auto hatte deshalb hat ihm in der entscheidenden session der dritte gang gefehlt ein handicap das man hier nicht gutmachen kann solange wir nun auch morgen den entscheidenden tick vorn sind bin ich sehr zufrieden
9262193 ich bin mit dem ergebnis sehr zufrieden auch wenn es nicht f r ganz vorn gereicht hat haben wir immerhin zwei autos in den top drei sowie drei autos in den top f nf f r sonntag ist im moment starker regen angesagt deswegen k nnte das rennen eine komplett andere geschichte werden als das qualifying heute wir haben eine gute ausgangsbasis stark war auch die leistung von gary paffett der es nach seinem ausrutscher gleich zu beginn noch in die top acht geschafft hat ich freue mich dass morgen lewis hamilton f r die fans ein paar demorunden mit seinem mclaren mercedes drehen wird lewis ist gl hender dtm fan und verpasst so gut wie kein rennen

9262199 encuesta inc is incredibly honored by this recognition of our efforts on their behalf
9262200 it is a privilege to work with a company that is so widely recognized for their proven commitment to supporting the hispanic community the experience of serving a growing brand in an otherwise stagnant product category is refreshing
9262201 his cerdas team has continually demonstrated industry leading expertise in the design implementation and evaluation of market research
9262202 there is no doubt that the reason encuesta is successful in demonstrating its marketing research prowess is because martin exhibits a constant focus on excellence and an unyielding commitment to customer service
9262203 were continually researching and learning about the diverse hispanic population in order to promote the communitys thoughts and convey them to the public and to our clients in a manner that adds strategic value to their business

9262210 we have been tracking gustav closely and for the last couple of days have been in consultation with the cayman isles and our own commanders back in uk the opportunity to conduct a survey of the smaller cayman islands just 12 hours after the hurricane has passed through presents a tangible example of how the royal navy can assist the caymans we are ready for whatever is asked of us over the coming few days
9262211 ahead of our arrival we have conducted some outline planning familiarising ourselves with the cayman isles plans and given some thought to how our people might be involved we have then been able spent time refreshing some key skills needed ashore such a first aid and map reading
9262212 racing and bolton have reached an agreement for the loan of ebi smolarek to the british team until june 30 2009

9262214 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9262215 and it is warm not something im really used to
9262216 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too

9262228 that kind of pressure is normal it is my job
9262229 if you cant take it you cant do the job
9262230 i was not upset everyone can see the game and say what they think i respect the opinions of all the managers
9262231 usually you would not speak about the national team manager
9262232 here it is different here everyone has an opinion i have seen portsmouth twice already but i do not speak about those games it is very important to have respect
9262233 when i didnt call him up for the first match there was massive uproar now you are telling me i should not call him up
9262234 i looked at the czech game again and he ran a lot as much as the other players maybe a little bit more
9262235 he did not do anything amazing but sometimes he can be very dangerous
9262236 i look at his schedule but no one is untouchable
9262237 english football managers such as capello should be given the power to grant citenzenship to forign football players now that will give us hope
9262238 seagullsandwish i wouldnt talk soo much man u only managed a draw just 2 weeks ago against newcastle and losing in the super cup well thats speaks for its self just worry about ronaldo getting back otherwise you can kiss all your trophies goodbye and pray that you finish in the top 4
9262239 i think were very lucky to be looking at good weather for this weekend
9262240 we had a slow summer definitely slower than in the past
9262241 it started out slow obviously but as the summer went on the weather definitely cooperated with us so i think it was a pretty normal year after the flood the waters receded and everything got back to normal
9262242 im hoping that people come up especially with gas prices really going down

9262254 i personally talked to many california based reps before choosing livinthedream and jeff2 sales i was really impressed by their level of professionalism they and their companies are committed to the dussault and moneybag preference of long term retailer partnerships while only working with the cream of the retail marketplace the ski and snowboard retail arena is a new one for the company and we always welcome new growth into new markets
9262255 at this point in time i on behalf of the family do not wish to say anything until everything is finalised
9262256 i hope you understand what we are going through and i only ask that we be given space to deal with our loss first
9262257 this is probably the most challenging times in the telecommunication industry and the board has every confidence in tabaleka managing these challenges

9262259 whilst acting in the ceo position tabaleka has demonstrated exceptional ability to continue to drive the company forward protect and grow tfls business as reflected in the companys recent financial results and we have been very pleased with his performance and ability to deliver key strategic initiatives

9262262 stanford researchers have published results that verify yes human embryonic stem cells are rapidly rejected by the immune system considered foreign enemies when injected into the body
9262263 when transplanted into mice with normal immune systems the cells were dead within a week in subsequent transplant attempts the embryonic stem cells were eliminated even faster showing that the immune system had been primed to reject the cells similar to a vaccination
9262264 earlier reports showed the same rejection using mouse embryonic stem cells injected into the heart with increasing rejection potential as the cells differentiated with other differentiated embryonic stem cells similar rejection has been observed
9262265 of course the fda has yet to approve any clinical trial with embryonic stem cells because these cells whether growing or even pre differentiated have a nasty tendency to form cancerous tumors
9262266 but the current findings show there are multiple problems with potential application of embryonic stem cells for humans
9262267 trials of this nature are a hugely exciting prospect for uk ports of entry border control is an issue close to everyones heart and the ability to combine speed and throughput of passengers with the highest integrity of border control will change the travel experience as we know it this really is a ground breaking trial
9262268 identity matters and increased electronic integration within automated control systems like the simple use of an electronic passport checked at an automated clearance gate depends highly on the speed of interaction with the passenger while providing an efficient tool to cope with the increasing throughput of travellers maintaining the existing high security levels at the border

9262286 it is very disappointing that pakistan hasnt played a test match this year i dont think such a thing has happened to any country in the past
9262287 we would have played at least three tests had australia toured pakistan but it is very sad that we are having a year without tests the more test matches in pakistan the better for the country since test cricket is the real test of a players temperament and skill
9262288 the speedster has been approached by the surrey management as it wanted to hire shoaibs services during the ongoing season
9262289 shoaib wanted to play a couple of matches for english county surrey and had applied for the noc we have issued him the noc with the condition that he had to show his availability whenever required during that period
9262290 if the series materialises he shoaib has to show his availability for the national team irrespective of his commitments with surrey in case of his selection on the national team he will have to return home to join the squad
9262291 we are happy that he has got a chance to play competitive cricket the short stint with the english county will definitely help him regain his form and fitness it will also give him a chance to prove his fitness for international cricket
9262292 after a detailed review of the determination by nepra the prime minister in consultation with finance minister syed naveed qamar and minister for water and power raja pervaiz ashraf allowed a 31 per cent increase in power tariff
9262293 it is for the first time in the recent history of the country that power tariff is being increased by 31 per cent
9262294 there will be no increase in power tariff for consumers who consume only 50 units but those who consume more than 50 units will now have to pay huge bills
9262295 republican leaders took a step backwards with the state budget proposal they outlined today
9262296 locking in california education funding at the bottom of the nation is not budget reform its a budget catastrophe that destroys our childrens future
9262297 its time for state lawmakers to put politics aside show some leadership and listen to voters by supporting a responsible state budget plan that includes some additional revenues to prevent even deeper cuts to education healthcare and other vital services
9262298 the president should always be non partisan but the presidency will again become abode of a political party if zardari is elected president

9262319 im not going to say hes going to win the young vote
9262320 but i think by the end of the campaign there are going to be a lot of young voters saying john mccain is the best fit to lead the country
9262321 if theres some perilous situation going on i think bush might bow out
9262322 whether you agree with how hes running the country or not he should speak
9262323 weve got to remember our economy is technically not in a recession but our economy is still growing
9262324 anyone who tries to say john mccain is another george bush thats a ludicrous claim

9262345 ja mik surullista kukaan neuvostoliiton korvanneiden uusien itsen isten valtioiden johtajista ei soittanut gorbat oville kiitt kseen h nt tai osoittaakseen h nelle kunnioitusta siit mit h n oli saavuttanut ilman gorbat ovia he eiv t olisi koskaan olleet asemassaan uusien valtioiden johtajina
9262346 se osoitti h nelle kunnioitusta miehen joka oli aikaansaanut rauhanomaisen muutoksen vahvasti aseistautuneesta ja totalitaarisesta j rjestelm st demokraattiseen ja moderniin valtioon h n s sti neuvostoliiton jugoslavian kohtalolta
9262347 palasin aikaisempaan ammattiini eli toimittajaksi ja politiikan ja historian tutkijaksi
9262348 mielest ni t t tilannetta ei pid arvioida kylm n sodan perustein
9262349 se ei kuitenkaan tarkoita sit ett jos gorbat ov olisi ollut kremliss h n olisi k ytt ytynyt samalla tavalla kuin p ministeri putin todellakaan ei olen varma siit
9262350 ojennuksista ei ole valitusmahdollisuutta t m tulee ty ryhm n mietitt v ksi tavalla tai toisella
9262351 suurin ongelma kurinpidossa on ett varusmiehet eiv t koe olevansa osana oikeudellista prosessia
9262352 tavallisena arkip iv n pidet n 18 esitutkintaa ymp ri suomea onko n ist kaikki varmasti sellaisia jotka pit hoitaa sotilaskurinpitomenettelyn kautta
9262353 rakenteet ovat teknisesti tuhoutuneet k yt nn ss aseman uudistaminen tarkoittaisi rakennuksen purkamista l hes kokonaan ja uuden rakentamista pelk st n alueen raivaaminen nielee paljon rahaa
9262354 kaupunki l htee siit ett jos mahdollista asema remontoidaan entiselleen se on niin keskeinen ja kaupunkikuvallisesti arvokas paikka
9262355 tunsin k dess ett mies menee alas ei t llaiset kuitenkaan ole mitenk n kivoja juttuja
9262356 tuollainen tilanne on v h n sama kuin vastustaja loukkaantuisi
9262357 minulle lyhyt vasenk tinen sopii parhaiten pitkien kanssa olen ongelmissa samoin nopea vasuri voi olla hankala vastus
9262358 kun tiet ett on matsi tulossa harjoittelu on erilaista pukukoppikokemuskin on t rke henkinen valmistautuminen tulee aivan toisella tavalla
9262359 amin toimi ammattilaisen tavoin h n lopetti ottelun kun se oli mahdollista
9262360 well just cut everything across the board by 3 percent
9262361 das ist keine gute au enpolitik und schm lert unsere autorit t in der welt
9262362 we pride ourselves on spending most of our time on strategy as a team
9262363 i think we still have that in our pocket and our position on pit lane definitely helps during the race hopefully we can save some fuel and keep that going
9262364 there are going to be a lot of people trying different strategies to improve their positions a lot of the guys and girls eight to 10 starting spots back are going to try some pretty crazy things but well keep our mind focused on the race and try to go for the win
9262365 i knew this was going to be between scott and me and it will be very close between both of us
9262366 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please help take care of me
9262367 es ist ein stundensatz von sieben bis acht euro im gespr ch
9262368 reflects and reinforces the growing bicultural community we live in
9262369 anybody who knows latinos knows that humor and laughter is a huge part of our culture we were thrilled to collaborate with mtvs on air promos team for this campaign that really speaks the language of young latinos
9262370 returning the double stack to our super value menu for 99 cents is our way of responding to the continuing economic situation and helping folks who are looking for ways to save money yet not sacrifice quality for price
9262371 i think they execute very well and man to man theyre probably a little better than we are
9262372 i know when i look at the film im going to see a lot of times where russler gets hit at the line of scrimmage or a yard after and we were just missing tackles
9262373 were standing straight up and arm tackling instead of driving and rolling our hips and you cant beat good teams doing that
9262374 im really happy with our offensive line because in our scrimmage last week we didnt block anybody
9262375 im old school if we can come off the ball and hand it to the fullback to me thats great football
9262376 whatever they gave me i tried to make the most out of it
9262377 they ran three plays a dive a keep and sometimes the quarterback did a rollout but well buckle down on those things at practice this week so it wont happen again this season at all i can guarantee that
9262378 he has the potential to go all the way on every play
9262379 i started to smell something then we heard a popping noise
9262380 she laid there a little while but she is ok
9262381 there was a massive amount of fire but we got in there and got it stopped and got into the attic and got it stopped
9262382 were having huli huli chicken in honor of the hawaiian rainbow warriors they hate to be called that were also having hawaiian rice and hawaiian punch and vodka
9262383 the sec is always tough but we get lsu at home this year thank god
9262384 our first big sec game is going to be away tennessee is one intimidating place to play
9262385 i just accept the fact that the swamp is a hot box
9262386 i think gatorade is good for getting electrolytes and staying hydrated
9262387 when we went to school here all the games were at 1 30 p m so i was glad when they moved to more night games
9262388 we have a large problem with it in the summer when kids are out of school and also when college starts up again
9262389 sometimes well see as many as 15 or 20 mailboxes in a single neighborhood destroyed
9262390 rarely do we catch the people who actually do it
9262391 it usually happens in the middle of the night and by the time you hear the noise and wake up theyre gone
9262392 i can tell you right now the u s attorneys office wont take a case unless there are mitigating circumstances like someones on a wild mailbox bashing spree and hit 400 mailboxes in one night
9262393 in 17 years weve never had one of these go to the u s attorneys office its a low priority crime for them
9262394 the poor guy was maybe 75 80 years old and was out there taping up his mailbox
9262395 had that law been in effect the kid wouldve lost his license for 30 days
9262396 are absolutely biased in the tank supporting the obama candidacy while claiming the mantle of objectivity whether theyre in the front page of the washington post the new york times whether its any one of the newscasts i mean its ridiculous
9262397 ladies and gentleman the coverage of barack obama was embarrassing
9262398 he is running for the most important office in the world he basically got a free pass
9262399 and obama has really evaded the issue and the media has not been after him for it and i think thats disgraceful
9262400 i think the way the national media in this country is performing is disgraceful
9262401 to report suspected child abuse while protecting the identity of the facility or person providing the information
9262402 on a bill in committee requiring criminals to serve consecutive sentences for separate crimes involving convictions for severe bodily harm or sexual assault but didnt vote at all when the measure came to the floor
9262403 making it harder for abusive and neglectful parents to regain custody of their children
9262404 to prohibit convicted sex offenders from serving on school boards
9262405 mr obama was the only member of the state senate to vote against a bill to prohibit the early release of convicted criminal sexual abusers and was among only four who voted against bills to toughen criminal sentences increase penalties for criminals whose offenses were committed in the furtherance of gang activities and increase penalties for the delivery of ecstasy and other designer drugs
9262406 they in fact were partners in various entities and regularly exchanged ideas
9262407 including on how to turn chicago schools into re education camps to create a generation of social revolutionaries
9262408 when i was growing up here the 301 24 interchange was the biggest thing i knew
9262409 as a kid that overpass was just huge and in the 50s before i 75 and i 95 301 was it
9262410 i want a coffee table book about 301 thats the more interesting road to me
9262411 there was just no hope there it was gone i mean its not like you could just go in and sop up the water and replace a few walls it was gone
9262412 we talk to them we comfort them we give them a meal and its like oh wow i cant believe you really did this for me
9262413 were still in a hotel but my husband is going to take care of that part of it while i go take care of the other people
9262414 it was amazing to watch our team evolve over the weekend
9262415 today we were able to win big points and take control of some sets early which allowed us to cross the threshold and win a couple matches i also liked the resilience our team showed in coming from behind to win some big sets
9262416 charde and emily supplied some tremendous performances in their first starts of the season
9262417 they were able to come in and change the teams chemistry on the floor helping lead us to a pair of victories
9262418 elaina and brittany were able to find a strong connection which will continue to grow as the season progresses
9262419 elaina had a strong tournament and deserved her spot on the all tournament team
9262420 this is an exciting award and we are grateful for the recognition
9262421 this only pushes us to work harder and to make more dynamic compelling and intelligent films that really connect with a wide and varied viewership
9262422 latino public broadcasting is proud of bernardos accomplishment and salutes american experience and pbs for bringing this moving portrait of a latino hero to television audiences
9262423 were facing what could be a very strong hurricane possibly one of the largest and strongest to hit america since records began
9262424 we have gone from a reactive organization to a proactive organization
9262425 theres no reason for anyone to stay in new orleans to ride out this storm
9262426 we cant stop the damage from happening what we can do is move people out of harms way
9262427 working at kings island helped prepare me so much because you have to work so hard doing four shows a day intense choreography and every day was challenging
9262428 an increase in the levels of cryptosporidium has been detected through our routine water quality sampling programme this has prompted us to take this precautionary measure to protect public health
9262429 tap water in the area is supplied by welsh waters mynydd llandegai water treatment works this works takes water from the machlyn bach and ffynnon lligwy reservoirs
9262430 the treatment works that supplies capel curig also uses ffynnon lligwy as a raw water source
9262431 an increase in the levels of cryptosporidium has been detected through our routine water quality sampling programme this has prompted us to take this precautionary measure to protect public health
9262432 if you have gastroenteritis dont return to school or work until you have been symptom free for 48 hours dont visit patients in local hospitals and long term care facilities
9262433 while many people tend to feel better sooner illness can still spread if they return to work or school within 48 hours since the last symptom
9262434 from media relations to measurement maximizing your multicultural initiatives in 2008
9262435 amazon amp beyond will not only be an exceptional exhibit at miami metrozoo but it will also be miamis next big thing we want the impressive collection of flora and fauna to inspire everyone to protect the endangered rainforests and the amazing animals that live there through participation in conservation programs and by making changes in the way we use natural resources together we can all make a positive impact
9262436 our hosts came together to bring viewers one of a kind interviews and red carpet exclusives of latino media greats we are very proud that one of latvs shows ceasar amp chuy was nominated and that mex 2 the max star yolanda perez performed a banda number at the sold out event the imagen foundation makes an invaluable contribution to the latino community and latino media as well as putting on a great show
9262437 though similar to the reprogramming technique developed by yamanaka of japan this new application eliminates the need to form embryonic type stem cells
9262438 harvard researchers had previously reported production of disease specific cell lines using the yamanaka technique but embryonic types of stem cells continue to show problems forming mature functional cells as well as their tendency to form tumors
9262439 melton has worked for years trying to make insulin secreting cells from embryonic stem cells
9262440 this new technique directly turns one type of fully formed adult cell into another type of adult cell eliminating the problematic step back to embryonic stem cells it also completely bypasses any need for using embryos or cloning for research
9262441 in case you missed it maarten van der weijden won the open water race olympic gold medal his life was saved years ago by an adult stem cell transplant for leukemia one of thousands of lives saved by adult stem cells
9262442 despite overwhelming popular support for restrictions on abortion the democratic party platform continues to advocate for the small minority of americans in favor of abortion on demand no matter what the circumstance
9262443 our party gets a lot of money from pro choice democrats but as this analysis shows it is not converted into votes for a pro choice presidential candidate
9262444 i am shocked at how cowardly these police officers behaved by attacking little girls without warning or provocation
9262445 operation rescue condemns this act of violence against peaceful demonstrators there was absolutely no reason for it
9262446 police officers are expected to control themselves better than that and if they cant they should not be in law enforcement we call for immediate disciplinary action against the officers involved in the brutality incident involving miss white and miss giacopuzzi
9262447 as a fsa 1 regulated business were ultimately responsible for the advice given to clients and this is documented in paperwork which has historically all been paper based while it has never happened this leaves the business vulnerable to claims if files were damaged lost or stolen and we couldnt prove what advice was given equally while the fsa has a series of principals about file storage these are open to interpretation and we wanted to move from a position of hopeful control to something more concrete
9262448 ifas produce tons of documents from the first fact finding stage where clients personal financial circumstances are assessed and recorded to applications ongoing evaluations and then management of commission statements the business was swamped with paper and deploying scanners and in future a group wide electronic document management system will allow us to streamline this
9262449 kodaks reliability is second to none and the throughput of the i1120 scanners is more than enough to cope with ifs workload theyre duplex have a small footprint and come with the most comprehensive warranty in the industry a unique three year next business day exchange warranty for free
9262450 over and above the obvious benefits the real value for us of scanning and electronic document management is the protection it provides in terms of proving what advice was given to clients if ever there were a query it is this safeguard which makes the investment in the hardware and software totally worthwhile
9262451 the new scanmate i1120s are proving a real hit with small to medium sized business who want a comprehensive package to realise the benefits of electronic document storage while they may be our entry level product they offer high performance and have all the features kodak has become well known for such as perfect page
9262452 i had a fractured skull with blood on my brain
9262453 i have bad dreams about it still today i was punched and i went to the floor he continued to beat my head into the floor
9262454 i dont understand why he did what he did and i dont think i ever will understand
9262455 i dont like it when people are behind me i even jump when my loved one comes up to rub my shoulders i jump
9262456 if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9262457 we want russia to be a good partner in the g8 and other organisations but it cannot pick and choose which rules to adhere to
9262458 that is why i will argue that russia should accept georgias territorial integrity and international mechanisms for addressing these conflicts and withdraw troops to their previous positions
9262459 suspension from membership of the party is a serious matter which will stand on councillor hanifs record in relation to all future activity
9262460 we will ensure the implementation of the plan of action as proposed by the conference to deal with the serious issue
9262461 however the nation has the resilience and the courage to stand up to such challenges
9262462 rpgs are for depressed gamers who like to sit alone in their dark rooms and play slow games
9262463 as a partner of the drive for diversity program since its inception sprint is proud to support an initiative that will help broaden the sport now and in the future

9262467 put concerted non violent efforts to bring a natural end to the torture and persecution in tibet
9262468 it clearly makes it more difficult for mccain to criticize obamas experience
9262469 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9262470 her executive experience consists of less than two years as governor of her sparsely populated state plus six years as mayor of wasilla pop 8 471
9262471 above all she has no record on foreign policy and national security including terrorism which mr mccain posits as the top challenge facing america and the world
9262472 i came to this job under a legal mandate i will only go if the law does not allow me to stay and not simply because someone issues threats and puts pressure on me
9262473 its a deadlock so we keep on protesting we are determined
9262474 this is a see saw battle it goes back and forth and we dont know how it will end
9262475 that royal trump card may allow samak to hold his ground
9262476 large scale evacuation will continue till all the marooned people are rescued in the next three to four days
9262477 we will have to provide food and shelter to the survivors until october as they will not be able to return home
9262478 essential commodities including food are now being transported by boat
9262479 more army personnel and medical teams have been sent to the affected districts with tents rubber sheets medicines and water purification tablets
9262480 we have been stuck here for the past 10 days with no rescue team reaching here our food and water stocks have run out our mobiles phones are working but they too will fail any moment
9262481 we have absolutely nothing with us here we left everything behind
9262482 considering that more than 40 states require vision screenings before children return to school and a recent survey found that 87 percent of respondents were unaware that one in four children have vision problems its very important that we provide a low cost solution for parents this back to school season and beyond
9262483 through our vision center products and services parents can ensure that their children receive the proper screenings necessary to head back to school without breaking the bank
9262484 were looking forward to presenting the findings and policy recommendations to the camps of both republican and democratic candidates as well as to key members of congress and other policy makers in september
9262485 a stronger latino community means a stronger nation as a whole its time to take the next step from diagnosis to action
9262486 the state of latinos 2008 defining an agenda for the future
9262487 we are proud of the latino center and pleased they are engaged in this important work with fundacion azteca america in an attempt to address one of the great issues of the day
9262488 today i notified csu athletic director paul kowalczyk that we would exercise this option
9262489 we will continue a dialogue with our colleagues at csu on the future of this great series beyond 2010 but it is very important that we host a sixth home game next year to live up to our commitment to our fans and to remain consistent with the standards of our big 12 conference
9262490 forty four of the 66 bcs schools are playing at least a seven game home schedule this season
9262491 and four of those teams are playing eight home games including nebraska from our own conference
9262492 its a horrible horrible tragedy for us and prosecutors throughout the state and really throughout the country were like a family
9262493 we are putting people who are violent people who are gang members behind bars and sometimes we are the targets of their rage
9262494 sean was one of the most warm caring people you could always matter
9262495 one of those people who always had a smile on his face
9262496 ihan ok kierros vaikka ei siit huippufiilikset j jos tekee loppuun kaksi bogia kaikki oli kuitenkin kunnossa

9262498 oli eritt in kova p iv tulokseen olen kuitenkin eritt in tyytyv inen siihen sain kaiken irti
9262499 we have suspended the agitation for the time being and not called it off as some of our demands are yet to be met
9262500 our goal is to provide the hispanic population with the knowledge necessary to understand political issues and thereby ultimately add their voice to the political election process
9262501 we want our audience to experience and understand the importance of this milestone event and to witness barack obamas historic acceptance of his partys nomination in front of a crowd of 75 000 we are equally proud to be the only station to provide this kind of comprehensive coverage to our communities
9262502 people say that they want change but to be honest with you people are afraid of you but change is here
9262503 he has the task of clearly defining the contrast between himself and sen john mccain and i think he did that
9262504 we are organizing in every corner of the state rural and urban cities and towns so thats what this campaign is going to come down to in north carolina
9262505 we just went out on some race set up and got going pretty good i just wanted to put in as good a lap as we could and if we got a point we got a point and if we didnt we didnt i kind of took it turn by turn and i knew i was on a good one i kept going with it and it was a decent lap
9262506 it was a pretty clean session everything went pretty good we made some changes to the bike last night and made it better hopefully it will be a good race
9262507 my bike has been good all year its a mess whats going on and im not getting involved with that i dont know whats going on but its a definite mess its not up to me so i cant speak for anybody on it
9262508 it was great to be out here for the first time playing a game the atmosphere was great
9262509 playing on the new field was exciting and it was good to hear when the lumen christi coaches came over and told me how impressed they were by the whole thing
9262510 he was just walking and officers noticed him stopped him and questioned him as to who he was
9262511 it was a good start and the defense played great tonight
9262512 donte donaldson had a great game at linebacker adrien bouyer had a big interception phil scullion and john ayres played solid as linebackers and the d line gave those three guys the opportunities to fill in and make the tackles
9262513 traffic is really going to dictate how long it will take the buses to get back and forth between bailey park and downtown
9262514 the big unknown in all of this is traffic conditions on capital avenue and trying to maintain a schedule theres not a lot of routes to take to get from downtown to bailey park
9262515 its going to be kind of a call it as it happens situation
9262516 i just met with some of the city folks as well as the campaign people helping to put this thing on and theyre anticipating somewhere upwards of 15 000 people
9262517 if they get those kinds of numbers there simply isnt enough parking to accommodate everybody at bailey park the shuttle service hopefully will take some of the pressure off of that
9262518 were keeping our fingers crossed that there is rain with the front
9262519 we really just want folks to be prepared to evacuate because this is a critical fire day and as folks in this country know things can happen fast
9262520 most of the fire looks really good but that north and northwest corner is being really active and it may have jumped the line again
9262521 i saw five of them today and they are in perfect condition
9262522 the fuel is completely burned out around four of them
9262523 your father died last night i will go to the funeral and you will go to school
9262524 dont feel so bad its like you were saying goodbye to your father with your song
9262525 that other insight is nice but it doesnt quite match the import of the words of your song listen to what you yourself wrote
9262526 those are not the words of a child singing to a parent those are the words of a parent singing to a child
9262527 when my father and mother leave me g d will gather me in
9262528 a person does not sin unless a spirit of insanity has entered into him
9262529 and for one who did not lie in wait to kill premeditatedly but g d has caused it to happen to him i shall establish for you a place to which he can flee
9262530 they really are talking about how to clean out the city should they need to
9262531 all three of our kids are politically conservative theyre all active and so its kind of fun to go to a republican convention if youre a republican
9262532 i just think it was the excitement of being there you know the balloons dropping getting to hear the president and vice president speak and it was just a lot of energy
9262533 my colors were pink and green he my father didnt really like that
9262534 i think because our biggest issue right now is national security with his experience
9262535 i feel comfortable that he will be able to make the united states safe and get through the war in iraq
9262536 obviously on our energy and gas we need to bring those prices down soon because im driving from denver to highlands ranch every day and its getting expensive
9262537 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9262538 and it is warm not something im really used to
9262539 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9262540 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9262541 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9262542 can step in and become president and i dont think anybody has any doubt about that
9262543 counsel and advice of somebody whos not going to agree with me 100 percent of the time
9262544 but for the rest of us theres still no change
9262545 we plan to start when were going to start and end when were going to end
9262546 were good friends were getting to know each other hes a really nice person
9262547 we go out minsan with friends minsan hindi laughs were getting to know each other
9262548 were getting to know each other because we work together so siyempre you want to get to know the people that you work with
9262549 siya na lang yung tanungin niyo basta we go out and just enjoy each others company
9262550 wonka arte is about celebrating day of the dead traditions with modern day hispanic youth in fun wacky and artistic ways
9262551 we partnered with mun2 to provide an open canvas that would allow teens to express themselves freely while embracing their cultural roots
9262552 every day i repent and plead with g d to forgive my shortcomings and failings in my service of him
9262553 at one point in my life i decided that all the honor and attention i was receiving from everyone around me was interfering with my service of the creator g d must be served with joy and without complete humility joy is impossible so i decided that i would spend several months in a place where no one recognized me
9262554 i dressed in simple garments and began my self imposed exile wandering from town to town one night i was in a small inn run by an old jew he was a very kind and simple man and we spoke for a while before i went to sleep early the next morning after i had prayed
9262555 what i didnt know was that several of my pupils had been searching for me and several hours after i left the inn they appeared hot on my trail did you see rabbi saadia gaon they asked him we have reason to believe that he was here
9262556 saadia gaon replied the bewildered old jew what would the great
9262557 but when the young men described me to him and explained about my exile and disguise the old jew grabbed his head and cried oy
9262558 after a short time he caught up to me jumped from his carriage and fell at my feet weeping please forgive me rav saadia please forgive me i didnt know that it was you
9262559 i made him stand up and brush himself off and then said to him but my dear friend you treated me very well you were very kind and hospitable why are you so sorry you have nothing to apologize for
9262560 no no rabbi he replied if i would have known who you are i would have served you
9262561 suddenly i realized that this man was teaching me a very important lesson in the service of g d and that the purpose of my exile had been fulfilled i thanked and blessed him and returned home
9262562 since then every evening when i say the prayer before sleeping i go over in my mind how i served g d that day then i think of that old innkeeper and say to myself oy if i had known about g d in the beginning of the day what i know now i would have served him completely differently

9262566 one of the greatest weaknesses exposed by hurricane katrina was the lack of planning and preparedness to care for the very people who are most vulnerable
9262567 yet most organizations have been afraid to care for medical special needs evacuees and turned them away either out of fear or lack of knowledge bcfs was chosen to take on this task due to our past experience in caring for people considered societys most vulnerable

9262575 we are a defensive team but today our defense didnt see too much time with the ball we were trying to possess the ball more in the second half
9262576 they dictate whats going to happen offensively and today we kept the ball in the attacking third 75 percent of the game so our defense didnt get a lot of time thats ok we have a big game today
9262577 we scored our first three goals in a spurt when we were playing pretty well
9262578 i think what happened was we just lost control of the midfield thats what turned the tide and i dont know how many 50 50 balls we won not very many
9262579 we know that early on were going to have to get some scoring we have some really good shooters and some goal scoring once we get some momentum going we can develop chances pretty fast

9262585 what it is about this is a check i do not understand what you are asking me
9262586 yes but the cheque was made out for 10 000 and there was no name on the check
9262587 ah why would i need my name on the check this is a donation i am not looking for honor for great awards you know i just want to give thats all
9262588 but tell me sir what is the reason that you sent us such a large donation
9262589 i want you to realize that it is very likely that we will be separated from each other

9262595 both of us survived the war mr bochner we were spared no one else in our entire town survived

9262597 more drivers are getting the message that if you drink and drive you will be caught you will be arrested and you will go to jail
9262598 but as good as this progress is in this day and age there is simply no excuse for someone to drink and then drive
9262599 i must say simons performance today was probably the most impressive thing i have seen from him since he joined our team he had only driven four laps around here in the wet prior to qualifying he went out and was quick straight away a very impressive performance
9262600 despite having no opportunity at all to fine tune the set up our guys and the acura engineers did a brilliant job to come up with a car that was very competitive
9262601 ive only done a couple laps in the wet myself but i think it is going to be a very interesting race tomorrow
9262602 im really proud of the team they gave me a great car and my first two laps in qualifying were my quickest they were really the only laps we had done in the dry
9262603 i really enjoyed it out there it was probably the best car i have ever had on a street circuit
9262604 we didnt want to risk anything during the morning in the wet and i only did a handful of laps im really happy with the result and it is great to get another front row start for such a young team
9262605 we havent done a lot of miles yet and we still have to look at tire degradation but i think we are looking strong for the race
9262606 despite the result of qualifying which places us on the fifth row we must also assess the positive points in our favour we feel we can maintain a good pace in the race tomorrow even if our single lap time is conditioned by some difficulties in the set up of our motorcycle in the warm up tomorrow we will be aiming to make a good recovery by finding an improved set up which should help us a little it is a pity as when you start a race aggressively as andrea has to youre using the bike to the very maximum the rider uses up energy and you are using up the tyres quickly too
9262607 we need to think about the race tomorrow and focus on the best way in which to approach it i put in a 1m 35 9s lap time despite the difficulties of the bike set up the michelin rubber is proving satisfactory but to recover so many positions from the start in the first few turns will be very difficult if we were on the second and not the fifth row then we would have a better chance of a good result obviously being positive we still have warm up tomorrow to exploit any changes in the bike to make some progress and then in the race we will give the maximum as always
9262608 these last two days we have focused our work on the development of the set up of the bike we did make constant and small progress but we expected more even in qualifying configuration andreas pace could be good tomorrow in the race and he should have the ability to show that but we are penalized by our position on the starting grid
9262609 its been a real task today as weve been on the back foot because i had to sit out practice yesterday my rib injury is definitely improving and i feel much more comfortable on the bike but a lack of time on track has caused us quite a headache weve struggled mainly with the front end of the machine and this track is completely different from brno so we had a lot of setting changes to make i had to squeeze a lot into the two hours on track and we had to wait until the afternoon heat which will be similar to that of the race before we could try to find a useable race tyre then we had to fit in qualifying too and our final position today reflects this my crew chief has a lot of ideas about the areas we need to change and we will review the data overnight to see where we can make significant improvements during tomorrows warm up
9262610 its frustrating to come here after such a great weekend in brno only to end up at the back of the field we tried many different set up changes to provide me with more confidence in the front of the bike but nothing really brought much of an improvement i cant brake hard into the turns and this makes it difficult to put a fast lap together we have to find an improvement overnight and i am sure that tomorrows race will be tough but we have to keep pushing forwards to achieve the results we have shown we are capable of
9262611 its good that johns injury has improved but it has been a real set back for us this weekend as we have lost two hours of valuable track time we couldnt try a race tyre this morning because the temperature change for the afternoon was so great it wouldnt have been a realistic evaluation this left us with a lot of work to do in qualifying and we came across a chatter problem in the front end of his machine we basically ran out of time to overcome this problem as we also had to use a qualifying tyre to try and improve johns lap time we will make some changes in tomorrows warm up after weve evaluated the data and although our starting position is not so good i am sure that we can make progress while improving our lap time during the race
9262612 the car felt really good today during both practice sessions the key to all road courses is track position so hopefully we can get the motorola car into the firestone fast six tomorrow and have a good finish i feel really good about this weekend
9262613 the team 7 eleven car was pretty strong today we are still chasing some guys but i am pretty happy overall i think we should have a good day tomorrow
9262614 we werent very good today and it was evident by looking at our times the good news is we know what we need to do to make the meijer car better we have some time before qualifying tomorrow so hopefully we can find some speed
9262615 it was a very frustrating day for the formula dream team we made some setup changes but we couldnt get results that we anticipated and it felt like we were not moving towards the right direction we will look into the data we got from today and hopefully we can improve the car for the qualifying tomorrow
9262616 tomorrow will obviously be better for the xm acura team its a little bit difficult to go into qualifying without having any testing on the track this is the first time ive been here i dont know the track or the tricks you need here and we did a couple of laps on the wets rain tires today also and they are absolutely not the same so there were a lot of things that cost us some speed today but i think we will be in a much better position for the race tomorrow
9262617 weve been in our daytona prototype car were quickest every session gs car quickest every session thats been rare that weve pulled a clean sweep like that so far so good nobody knows how this place presents itself for a long race and thats going to be the trick a lot of these corners bend in so it forces a car ahead of you to bend in before you get in i see a lot of contact coming and i dont know how to get out of that just yet were trying to come up with a strategy and a plan to win the race
9262618 you never ever get a clear lap every one of these laps that im doing is in traffic in both daytona prototype and gs we have a great car its just a coincidence that for some reason here we are with two great cars that do great things im quite happy
9262619 i cant think of three good things about myself can i write only one
9262620 how about if we write three things we dont like and one good thing
9262621 why do we have to write down something good about ourselves why dont we just write down the bad things and burn them
9262622 every jew each commensurate with his abilities whether scholar or businessman must make an accurate accounting in his soul of everything that occurred in the course of the year each must know the good qualities in his service of g d and strengthen them he must also be aware of the deficiencies in himself and in his service and correct these through this excellent preparation one merits a good and sweet year materially and spiritually

9262625 the state of texas is working closely with its public and private sector partners to prepare for this storm
9262626 i think we all learned a lot from the 2005 hurricane season so were definitely using those lessons in this situation
9262627 what theyre learning here is how to work with our partners to take in evacuees to simply how to treat people who are having a pretty bad day
9262628 if we let people come out here en masse lets say on lake jessup there are a few homes still under water and that would cause water to flow into their living rooms and thats why we have those rules in place
9262629 the rain is not so intense but there is a lot a lot of wind
9262630 the officials they have told us the wind will be bad first but then the rain could cause flooding into the night
9262631 its very big and weve got to get ready for whats coming
9262632 oregon making michigan players look like they were wearing ankle weights
9262633 the big ten has never hit such an identity crisis as right now
9262634 the perception is that the champion from the big ten is about the sixth best team in the sec and that perception has become reality for many college football fans around the country
9262635 if you look at the 85 scholarship players my guess is that the sec has more drafted talent than the big ten
9262636 i love speed and the sec has great speed especially on the defensive line
9262637 but there are appropriate balances when mixing academics and athletics i wish we had six teams among the top 10 recruiting classes every year but winning our way requires some discipline and restraint with the recruitment process
9262638 its very grave we need help and we need it now
9262639 hurricane gustav destroyed roads houses and farms there is no electricity and no potable water about 40 percent of this city has been destroyed

9262642 he was threatening to kill her and starting to countdown
9262643 i was fighting and i wanted so much to win that match she served very well she came to the net many times she was more aggressive than i was
9262644 for me its a special tournament i wanted to play very well here
9262645 she started coming in and i was not able to keep her back or come in myself
9262646 everything has happened very quickly so i could not even say goodbye to my team mates
9262647 i could not decide if i wanted to go to england at first first yes then no
9262648 the only thing that stopped me from leaving was my family but now all doubts are behind me and i decided to sign a contract with tottenham
9262649 we must keep working to further and further reduce accidents until everyone goes home uninjured
9262650 our challenge is to keep this up through this year and into next year in this way we will continue to get the support we need to move the mine forward
9262651 i am very pleased with the performance because it was a complete one
9262652 offensively and defensively we had a good balance in our team there was some great movement and apart from ten minutes at the beginning of the second half where we suffered a little bit we were always in control
9262653 we played the game we love the game we know how to play and could have scored more i am pleased that we didnt concede any goals
9262654 van persie can be that link between midfield and the strikers and it is the way we want to play i think you could see he was in shape and when he is like that he is very important player for us
9262655 we came up against a side that had to bounce back from a poor result
9262656 we needed a break which we didnt get like when nicky butts header hit the bar but theres no denying theyre an excellent side and will finish in the top four the only thing theyre fighting for is where they will finish
9262657 everything happened very quickly i did not even have time to say goodbye to my spartak team mates
9262658 were probably not ready to win premier league games at the moment
9262659 weve got a lot of young players in the side but its not those players who are letting us down there are big players in the team not playing as well as they should be
9262660 you dont expect the players we have got to concede goals but they are and they take a big responsibility for what happened today
9262661 id been waiting for jermain defoe to come good him and peter crouch and it was nice to see them link up together
9262662 glen johnson is such a good player that he can play anywhere hes got everything you need as a right back sometimes he can get a bit casual but in terms of ability hes absolutely top class
9262663 that was a good conservative run and start to the weekend
9262664 with five qualifying runs its good to get a full run under our belts on our first run it was on the conservative end but we wanted to make it down the track we have a game plan for the race and want to stick to it
9262665 it does for our sponsors thats the main thing we were all told that if you won the shootout you were locked in now all of a sudden those of us that were locked in are not locked in it just shows you that anything can change at any moment
9262666 ive got to get jason keller back before he retires dale earnhardt jr
9262667 ive got to get jason keller back before he retires earnhardt said
9262668 yall remember myrtle beach my first busch series race he come off the wall and spun me out i was running sixth
9262669 im glad hes thinking of me that means ive done something right keller said laughing
9262670 you mess with the bull you get the horns well that works both ways there are other bulls in the garage carls one of them
9262671 charter is pleased that an agreement in principle to offer the big ten network to our customers has been reached
9262672 we believe this agreement is in the best interests of all charter customers we will work closely with btn to add the channel as soon as possible to our line ups hopefully in time for this saturdays opening games
9262673 it was a hard fought victory and we made hard work of it we should have had it wrapped up long before we actually did
9262674 we need to be more ruthless in both boxes the penalty was a bit of a turning point at 2 0 they would have been dead and buried
9262675 the pleasing thing is that we kept our nerve and tuncay came up with a great finish to give us the win
9262676 the players had to work so hard out there to get something out of the game and i thought wed come away with something after we scored and took the steam out of them
9262677 to play a long time with ten men and get an equaliser then get punished like that after a mis hit shot drops to somebody in the box is tough on our lads
9262678 good players will move the ball around against ten men and they did that to us but our lads kept on working
9262679 everybody tells you about the premier league and what its going to be like and wigan have had five shots on target and beaten us 5 0
9262680 was that the gulf in class i say to myself no at half time hull city were beating hull city
9262681 we slipped up at a set piece at one end and we slipped up from a set piece at the other end
9262682 that was a little detail that was the difference between the two teams and that gives me a little bit of hope
9262683 its a tough one to swallow i didnt think the gulf in the two teams was five goals
9262684 were only three games in to the season of course but arguably its the worst weve played it sounds stupid enough but it is
9262685 we got off to a great start and then we got the second one and i said at half time that the first 20 minutes would be vital if they get one back then it could be a tough afternoon
9262686 it was difficult coming here make no mistake about that we thought it was going to be as hard as it was going to be
9262687 im just delighted we got the win its been a tough week after the performance at manchester city and the way we played for much of the cup tie against macclesfield
9262688 its difficult with fans having a go at you after only two games but west ham fans are second to none when they get behind the team and thats what we want i can take any flak
9262689 its always like a circus when i come back here today i thought it was pretty tepid it was great there are probably 15 000 fans out there that were not even born when it happened
9262690 ive been back five or six times as a player and you get used to it to be honest
9262691 everything went against me today and everything went for curbs im not happy because we had enough chances to change the course of the game
9262692 if nobody wants to talks with us on these issues and cooperation with russia is not needed then for gods sake do it yourself
9262693 one of the agents was able to infiltrate the iranian industry
9262694 various supplies could also be sabotaged and stopped these were parts for missiles and launching equipment
9262695 i thought territorially we had most of the game although west brom were always dangerous on the break because they have got a lot of quality in their team
9262696 most of the pressure in the game came from ourselves and the quality of that pressure was a lot better in the second 45 minutes
9262697 i think it was a game we could easily have got three points from but we could easily have lost it as well
9262698 the pleasing thing was that we stood up to the bombardment that came our way and there are hopefully a few other additions to come that will help us cope with teams like bolton and the questions they ask you
9262699 qualifying was exciting i think we had enough to get pole but with the changing conditions from the practice sessions we had a little bit too much at the rear the rear tires came in before the fronts and hence we had a little too much understeer that is fixable for tomorrow
9262700 we never could make a qualifying setup for the dry every time we went out we were fastest in the rain when it was dry other teams could go back to their setups from last year but the ferrari for us is a new car so we didnt know really what we had for the dry we gambled and i think we had a pretty good setup third place is very good the race is long tomorrow and it is important to stay out of trouble as we have seen at long beach and st petersburg is very important to stay out of trouble if you brake late you are in the wall and if you dont look in your mirrors you have contact with the prototypes for sure this is the hardest one to stay out of trouble we have to stick to our position and we cant get a gap between and the flying lizards
9262701 we got everything right on the second practice we had been quickest in both the sessions in qualifying there was one corner still wet where you are under braking there is some time that could be gained there if you risked a lot but it was our first try on the slick and not worth the risk position three is ok i think the combination is able to do pole but it was difficult for everybody congratulations to wolf henzler he obviously got a good lap it was close traffic is going to be the issue in the race we have saw it last year lots of incidents lots of contact hopefully last weekends work will pay off this weekend
9262702 it was a pretty messed up first day with the weather especially with the program jim and i had it just didnt work out like we had planned it now at the end of the day i think i have eight laps at detroit thats the only way it was going to work out the weather bit us a little bit jim did a great job not having any laps in the dry he got much faster every lap ill just have to go out there and find my way around for the start of my stint no big deal it is a long race
9262703 my confidence is really good i couldnt get the car to turn and it started to push that was where i left all my time alex and i will go and try and run a solid race and look for a good finish with the 73 ferrari
9262704 its just one of those things where crew chiefs mike green and alan johnson u s army dragster work so close together
9262705 with the fram dragster being the next to last car right before tony schumacher ran i knew we had a good shot when we saw the car in front of us smoke the tires i think mike made one little adjustment
9262706 when the fram car left the starting line it had the front end hiked way up there for a long way and thats usually a good indicator
9262707 and when it set the front end down it made a good charge in the middle of the track i knew it was on a good run it started spinning the tires a little bit at the other end and i was just hanging on to it to get through there
9262708 this fram team has just gotten better and better as weve gone along this is the perfect time to make this kind of move its the perfect start to the weekend
9262709 number one is will moody and k pax 3r racing
9262710 weve got a heck of a setup number two i think the porsche is well suited to this track because of its short wheelbase and with the weight of the engine over the drive wheels you can really accelerate out of the slow corners number three is scca my roots
9262711 its only the first practice im not going to get carried away and start lighting candles and start sending up bottle rockets in celebration but i had a great time and im in my element im not taking chances the car is handling so well that i can drive it hard without much risk thats a credit to k pax racing and will the mad scientist engineer
9262712 the turns here are slow road racers are not usually used to doing slow turns one after another they are used to bigger sweepers and much higher speeds we spend a lot of time in second gear on this track far more than we would on most road race circuits
9262713 driving my car is a lot more fun than i expected and the ruby tuesday team really worked hard and did a great job preparing for this race for the first time with our new riley were actually running strong coming right off the trailer
9262714 the flow is good and i like the really really fast turns weve been p 1 in every session and that is where this team belongs they work as hard as anyone in the paddock sometimes harder
9262715 it would be really tough to race here without knowing the track the car was familiar and i got to learn the braking references and how to get around here
9262716 finding the right place for overtaking gt cars can be very difficult but weve found the right direction to balance the car there are still some issues where we can improve but i think we can get a good position tomorrow

9262729 it was really good im very proud of that lap
9262730 we went out kind of at the peak of the heat when things were just starting to break all in all im just extremely pleased with the lap and progress we made throughout the day to make the car faster were happy to start up front and hopefully we can take advantage of that
9262731 i missed turns 1 and 2 but 3 and 4 were awesome that was a great great lap for us
9262732 including a j i think he did a great job putting down a good smooth lap and certainly had us scared throughout the afternoon
9262733 the car was pretty good so there wasnt much more i could get out of that lap it was smooth as i could be
9262734 its always tough when youre in that situation of going home or just trying to make the race because youre always just a little bit nervous just to try and get a
9262735 its 1979 and a young martin sheen is taking us up that fateful river again he is our wise and somber virgil our guide our narrator the orm the only rational man leading us up that labyrinthine river of death and insanity which is our national crucible our vietnam war that great river of no return that winding thread of dark infuriating lies that will take us further and further into the heart of darkness into the heart of darkness of our great national shame and guilt and self loathing this was the real secret mission of that clandestine journey and they almost succeeded
9262736 sincerely i was expecting this sort of result because yesterday even if he concluded in fourteenth position we were really close to the fastest we made some adjustments on the bike reducing the weight in the front part and this allowed us to make a big step forward anyway tomorrow is the important day even if we are really proud of the position conquered today sylvain made it to improve but tomorrow morning in the warm up he will have to find some other solutions to be even faster
9262737 this afternoon we had to make some modifications to give more stability to the bike and my technical staff made a great job for the first time i will start from the second row and i hope to start well to be able to stay close with the fastest riders i am really trustful also because i didnt only conquered a good lap time with the qualifying but i have also improved a lot the race rhythm in this last session
9262738 i cant be happy about the twelfth position but i think positive for tomorrows race because the race rhythm has improved a lot from yesterday and with some small changes tomorrow during the warm up we can be even faster the bike has improved lap after lap and i am now able to push the bike more i am only half of a second from the second row therefore if i will make a good start i believe anything could happen during the race
9262739 youll see formation loops and rolls and were putting the airplane through everything that its capable of doing

9262741 high pressure will settle over us and when you hear high pressure think happy weather and the weekend weather is going to make an awful lot of people very happy especially for all your outdoor activities lots of sunshine warm temperatures and a little on the muggy side here and up north
9262742 im pleased with the decision it could be a lot worse
9262743 but you know its all about me staying in shape mentally and physically the week im out and being there for my teammates and getting san diego when i get back
9262744 thats the past now and its just time to move forward im just excited about what were going to do as a team

9262746 we all bring something to the table thats a little different im excited to see those guys go out there and play and make big plays against oakland
9262747 exempting the ski industry from sales tax was put forward in the 60s when the ski industry was very small and the state legislature wanted to encourage and promote it
9262748 i would argue that the ski industry is very much on its feet and has probably grown a few extra feet
9262749 following recent assessment we found that she hasnt been performing very well in her duties so thats why we asked her to step down from her post

9262751 it is apparent that delays in implementation of various reform programmes which are significantly behind schedule are now beginning to have adverse effect on the operating results of the corporation
9262752 the bring the sugar industry back to global competitiveness and prepare in the industry to survive the reductions in the protocol sugar price to 14 3 per cent in 2008 and 36 per cent in 2009 the implementation of the industry reform programme is urgently required
9262753 this will require cooperation and support of all stakeholders including growers landowners government and related institutions the corporation looks forward to working closely with all the industry stakeholders on this initiative
9262754 these diversification strategies are consistent with global sugar industry best practices for competing in the new market conditions
9262755 in addition to the mill upgrade project increases in cane production and diversification projects several other key areas is the streamlining of harvesting and transportation operations which provide huge opportunities for cost reductions
9262756 i just ran and saw the bus on fire i didnt think of anything i just started pulling people out
9262757 i helped as many as i could but i could not help all of them
9262758 the passengers started jumping off from a certain distance before the bus stopped in the ditch
9262759 a woman threw her eight month old baby outside and then she jumped
9262760 then there was this man who had managed to jump out but was badly burnt
9262761 he fell into the bushes and because it was dark we were only able to spot him when were looking for the passengers in bushes next to the road the man was taken to hospital in a taxi
9262762 i saw a woman trying to come out but couldnt because her leg seemed to be trapped i dont think i will ever forget what i saw that night
9262763 i saw a man die trying to protect his family
9262764 he had made it off the bus and then realised his wife and child had been left behind and he ran back to save them but never made it back out
9262765 weve struggled mainly with the front end of the machine and this track is completely different from brno so we had a lot of setting changes to make
9262766 my crew chief has a lot of ideas about the areas we need to change and we will review the data overnight to see where we can make significant improvements during tomorrows warm up
9262767 marvin is a terrific leader with more than twenty years of retail experience across a variety of functional areas
9262768 he has achieved a tremendous amount of success in the northern division during the past two and a half years and we look forward to him having an impact throughout our entire domestic store base
9262769 i would like to thank paul for his contributions to the home depot his commitment to the company during the past eight years is genuinely appreciated and we wish him well in the future
9262770 weve had quite a good second day here weve changed some set up things on the bike and tested quite a few of the tyres from our allocation we tried some very hard compounds for these hot conditions and they seem to be working very well this afternoon on qualifiers the tyre worked pretty well in the new chassis but i never quite managed to do that perfect lap and unfortunately we didnt quite make it to the second row of the grid having said that seventh is one of my better dry qualifying positions of the season so we are definitely making improvements my race pace is strong for tomorrow and i think with a good start we can fight for the podium
9262771 i am a bit upset with my qualifying position because we found a really good set up yesterday and we were not too bad this morning and we wanted to continue like that but this afternoon was a bit hotter and we made some changes and on the qualifiers we struggled a bit i am quite confident for tomorrow it wont be easy starting from 11th but ill be aggressive early on and my rhythm with race tyres is really good so well have to see what happens
9262772 its been a very competitive weekend so far for the team and todays qualifying results are disappointing in that they dont reflect our true potential we would have liked to have seen both bikes on the first two rows of the grid
9262773 with loris we tried a different direction this afternoon which we thought would be better but unfortunately it didnt work and it took a while for him to come back to the high rhythm that he showed yesterday afternoon and this morning that combined with the fact that he had a lot of traffic on his final lap resulted in a far from ideal qualifying result he says he can do much better in the race and he has the fire in his eyes so we are expecting a big show from loris tomorrow
9262774 how can this be happening when i am trying to serve g d
9262775 its one of my all time favourites even before i first came here which was back in 2002 for a formula renault race i played it on my computer it was always one of the best tracks it has probably the most exciting corner in formula 1 eau rouge and its one of the few circuits where you really feel like youre actually going somewhere you blast off into the forest and get to the top of the hill and can feel the whole circuit beneath you its one of the best challenges in formula 1

9262785 i thought last year would finally be the year the lions made it up to their fans for the years of misery inflicted on them and for eight weeks it looked as if id been right
9262786 this year i really think is the year and when im inevitably proven wrong ill say the same thing about next year not to say the lions will be a super bowl contender because we all know that isnt going to happen but this is going to be an entertaining team that should take advantage of a weak division and fight for its crown i wouldnt be surprised to see 9 7 take the nfc north and thats in the lions wheelhouse
9262787 we all know what roy williams is going to bring to the table hes averaged over 900 yards and seven touchdowns a season in his career while missing anybody who could take attention away from him now hes got that in calvin johnson who was hurt for much of his rookie season but still managed to put up impressive numbers all things considered hes healthy and drawing rave reviews this preseason and camp eager to justify all of the hype and money he got coming into the league with williams in a contract year this could be the best receiving duo in the nfl this season

9262923 modec is governed at a maximum speed of 50mph although the vehicle is capable of more it is designed for urban use so the energy saved by limiting the top speed can be used to enhance the performance and range of the vehicle
9262924 the report said the mode timing location and efficiency of food transport was as important as the distance covered
9262925 defra minister lord bach said this study is an interesting contribution to the food miles debate
9262926 it shows that the issue is complex and that a range of factors have an effect on the overall impacts of food transport not purely the distance travelled by individual products
9262927 for example internet buying and home delivery can cut vehicle kilometres and reduce road congestion
9262928 lord bach said buying local products had the potential to reduce the distance covered but that those benefits could be compromised if the methods of distribution were inefficient and caused congestion
9262929 the report also suggests better monitoring of air transport of food because it was more responsible for the highest carbon dioxide emissions per tonne of cargo and was the fastest growing sector

9262931 a less well known side of nuclear power it requires great amounts of cool water to keep reactors operating at safe temperatures that is worrying if the rivers and reservoirs which many power plants rely on for water are hot or depleted because of steadily rising air temperatures
9262932 if temperatures soar above average this summer let alone steadily increase in years to come as many scientists predict many nuclear plants could face a dilemma either cut output or break environmental rules in either case hurting their reputation with customers and the public
9262933 governments and the energy industry are just starting to grasp the vulnerabilities of water hungry power plants
9262934 were going to have to solve the climate change problem if were going to have nuclear power not the other way around said david lochbaum a nuclear engineer who is with the union of concerned scientists

9262942 right now the most important environmental issue facing ontario is whether proportional representation will be adopted voters in the oct 10 election will make the decision
9262943 the current system of voting delivers unequal representation which inevitably distorts the wishes of the public how else to explain why the government at queens park has kept a weak minister in the environment portfolio while the public has made it clear that environmental deterioration is a top of the mind concern
9262944 the current ontario electoral system breeds instability its a blood sport where opposition parties focus more on gaining power than on good government largely because they have little hand in creating policies and have no commitment to them
9262945 as a result government policies often have a short life span
9262946 proportional representation will result in more minority governments and coalitions which means responsibility for government policies would lie with more than one party

9262952 the gravest threat we foresee starts with surface melt on west antarctica and interaction among positive feedbacks leading to catastrophic ice loss
9262953 the best chance for averting ice sheet disintegration seems to be intense simultaneous efforts to reduce both co2 emissions and non co2 climate forcings
9262954 present knowledge does not permit accurate specification of the dangerous level of human made ghgs however it is much lower than has commonly been assumed if we have not already passed the dangerous level the energy infrastructure in place ensures that we will pass it within several decades

9262969 food travelled an average of 1640 km in its final trip to the grocery store out of total of 6760 km on the road for the raw ingredients but some foods log more kilometres than others red meat averaged 20 400 km just 1800 of those from final delivery
9262970 accounting for greenhouse gas emissions made those contrasts even starker final delivery food miles make up just 1 of the greenhouse emissions of red meat and 11 for fruits and vegetables
9262971 to drive his point home weber calculated that a completely local diet would reduce a households greenhouse emissions by an amount equivalent to driving a car 1600 km fewer per year

9262992 oslo sept 28 reuters a record melt of arctic summer sea ice this month may be a sign that global warming is reaching a critical trigger point that could accelerate the northern thaw some scientists say
9262993 the reason so much of the arctic ice went suddenly is that it is hitting a tipping point that we have been warning about for the past few years james hansen director of nasas goddard institute for space studies told reuters the arctic summer sea ice shrank by more than 20 percent below the previous 2005 record low in mid september to 4 13 million sq km 1 6 million sq miles according to a 30 year satellite record it has now frozen out to 4 2 million sq km

9263024 alaska governor and all around sweet gal sarah palin can help sen mccain win this election by using her good looks and thin resume to appeal to voters who spend their entire day glued to fox news and or sleeping shes a mainstream republican girl who will shoot anyone who crosses her unite the party and service john mccain well when cindy mccain is not looking she has yet to decide what a vice president does but as soon as she memorizes the duties we will issue a new statement gov palin is an inclusive republican who will not accept contributions from gay or lesbian voters and because we love her shoes
9263025 sarah palin has executive experience more than obama more than john mccain even
9263026 ask yourself could sarah palin have run a national election campaign against say a machine as powerful as the bush family and won does she have the skill set to construct a campaign that would actually have brought her to the nomination herself i find the comparison with obama ludicrous but it will be made palin looks to me like a lovely person and a good local politician with some inevitable rough spots id be delighted if she took a leadership role in the gop in the future but in the same league as obama do republicans really think that little of him i guess they do we are looking at a different person

9263029 the packers might lose flynn if they place him on waivers and i dont think they are willing to take that chance
9263030 hes not ready to be a no 2 quarterback but hes an ideal no 3
9263031 the truth is green bay wouldve been better off had flynn played poorly against the titans i didnt see him getting claimed before that game but now im not so sure hes probably a better prospect than quite a few of the third stringers on other rosters
9263032 ted thompson and mike mccarthy arent stubborn enough to go with the two rookies behind rodgers are they if they are flynn may have won the no 2 job on thursday
9263033 there are three players fighting for one or two spots i know kregg lumpkin has gotten a lot of press lately but mccarthy really likes herron and morency this will be a tough call
9263034 i dont think tory humphrey has done enough to earn the backup job joey haynos outplayed finley all summer but he seems destined for the practice squad there should be some decent veterans available after final cuts
9263035 they could carry a sixth receiver if jones isnt going to be ready for the opener against the vikings brett swain would probably be the choice but would thompson keep him over a better player at another position i kind of doubt it
9263036 junius coston isnt a bad guy to have around but do the packers really need a third center and a fifth guard breno giacomini belongs on the practice squad the ninth offensive lineman could come via a trade or the waiver wire
9263037 thompson has done nothing in camp to earn a spot on the final roster but hell probably stick based on his draft status and his potential alfred malone would be a more deserving choice
9263038 it might be hard to justify keeping seven linebackers if the numbers dont work out hodge could wind up being traded
9263039 charlie peprah was playing well before he got hurt it could come down to either culver or jarrett bush culver had the better camp but the coaches really like bushs versatility
9263040 jansens knee injury against the titans and his erratic snapping in the last two games could put his roster spot in jeopardy

9263088 heres a great album i just listened to the recent winner of light from above was released on march 18 2008 blabbermouth net stating the album contains big sometimes pop based melodies meets crunchy guitar driven metal that falls somewhere between thrash traditional metal and the dirtier end of 80s glam hair metal
9263089 despite their youth they are certainly not ignorant of their roots they have started performing prowler an
9263090 hair metal was a fad even its most loyal fans couldnt have ever expected the genre to continue in the mainstream chart topping format that it had held in 80s america its a well known saying that too much of anything is bad for you and this was definitely true of the bands that had originally received fame on the la circuit hair metal was so in tune with the 80s that even the bands who had hit the big time in that decade found it hard to even chart their material in the 90s an article in q magazine once said that its readers taught kurt cobains greatest achievement was destroying hair metal it seems that the ignorance of the grunge era is not yet dead completely when we read this statement because we wonder why the supposed readers had no time to take into account the changing political climate the fall of the soviet union the reinvention of mtv and beavis and butthead an animated cartoon series about two college students who would sit on a couch and comment on the latest music videos with their next door neighbour being portrayed as an uncool kid that wore a winger t shirt but i suppose if you were the kind of person who got down to a song like poisons nothing but a good time in 1988 youd hardly have taken a fancy to nirvanas rape me in 1992
9263091 but were in 2005 now and both decades have ended and if you look around and i mean look beyond the obvious youll start noticing that hair metal is still there the bands still release the albums the groups still perform the tour and the records still ascend the charts but try looking for grunge try looking for grunge past bands like nickelback and staind past yet another nirvana greatest hits compilation and youll start to notice something grunge is gone grunge is dead sure grunge has helped influence some of the most successful rock groups of the late 90s and early 00s but it hasnt actually succeeded in doing what it was created to do eliminating the bands with the big mullets and the leather pants some hair metal bands remerged from the woodwork in the mid 90s noticing that their biggest enemy had vanished and they were free to sell records again in fact while nirvana fans may be so bold to claim that cobain killed hair metal music fans might admit that the real truth is simply that cobain just stalled hair metal and actually killed grunge as well as himself billy corgan of the smashing pumpkins once said kurts death seemed to take the wind out of everyones sails and in retrospect perhaps this is the most truthful statement that has ever been made about grunge
9263092 that was really stupid and wrong for me to wear that for one half hour in my life what nobody brings up is in 2000 when i was in

9263094 the last time i was doing a solo tour in brazil a longtime d2 fan approached me on the streets of sao paulo and he told me that he had been to an andy timmons guitar clinic and had a chance to speak with andy so he asked andy
9263095 hey andy want to play some concerts in south america with your band and then do a set of danger danger tunes with ted
9263096 i am very excited to be playing with andy again for this special tour and especially to see his own band in action just to watch him play up close is such a privilege its like watching a miracle in progress and when we combine forces onstage to play the classics i am going to have the best seat in the house i have been dreaming about this reunion for almost 20 years

9263108 a few days back i was in a city bus and struggling to juggle my laptop bag my purse and of course myself some people are gifted and can manage to stand through the most wobbly of rides but not me i belong to that elite group of people who manage to stumble on anything even in a stationary bus if there was ever a doubt then let me state with supreme confidence that i am probably the biggest klutz on planet earth lots of people saw my struggle but no one even offered to help me i felt so angry that i could have choke slammed a few of them right then and there but of course i didnt couldnt is the right word i realized how unreasonable i was being in expecting something when i myself have never volunteered to help someone with their luggage on a few occasions i have given up my seat for an elderly person but i can do much more instead of chatting away to glory like i do all the time if we could just look around in the bus we would find at least one person who could do with some help although there are reserved seats for physically handicapped people and senior citizens most of the time someone has to yell at a healthy teenager to vacate the seat before they themselves get up and offer the place i think that we should also urge the driver or conductor to not overload a bus when people do not even have place to stand

9263160 el amor es el que impulsa al artista a buscar los lenguajes que expresan la belleza
9263161 cuando uno conoce los mecanismos de la raz n termina por desconfiar de ella
9263162 no se puede ser artista si no se ha perdido algo
9263163 s lo el amor pasajero es eterno es amor que se va pero no muere la ausencia hace que los romances duren siempre
9263164 la incredulidad es la sabidur a de los imb ciles
9263165 cada sombra es una esperanza cada luz prendida un desenga o
9263166 la l grima corre la misma suerte de aquello que llora
9263167 el m rito del artista consiste en encontrar resquicio para filtrar su alma a trav s de las severas prisiones que imponen las formas
9263168 si la creaci n art stica implica la perpetua originalidad digo ya que su ejercicio es imposible
9263169 hay para cada hombre una mujer una sola que re ne todas las virtudes que ese hombre sue a su belleza est hecha para deslumbrar a ese hombre su voz ha sido creada para seducirlo su inteligencia para suscitarle y sugerirle ideas amables su ternura para hacerle dulce el diario sufrimiento esa mujer existe y anda por esas calles pero el destino ha decidido que nunca jam s se crucen los caminos de ning n hombre con la mujer que para l fue concebida
9263170 as como las personas que mueren en su plenitud nos ahorran el recuerdo de su vejez los amores interrumpidos abruptamente siguen viviendo en nuestro coraz n no como brasas agonizantes sino como horrorosas llamas que queman cada noche
9263171 no hay mejor amor que el que nunca ha sido los romances que alcanzan a completarse conducen inevitablemente al desenga o al encono o a la paciencia los amores incompletos son siempre capullo son siempre pasi n
9263172 a veces se me hace que este mundo es falsificaci n barata de otro nada sale nunca del todo bien la vida es hermosa pero uno se muere el amor tiene un precio alt simo el vino ocasiona dolor de cabeza siempre falta alg n detalle y ese detalle es decisivo
9263173 nadie puede negar el poder diab lico de la belleza se trata en realidad de una fuerza mucho m s irresistible que la del dinero o la prepotencia cualquiera puede despreciar a quien lo juzga mediante el soborno o el temor por el contrario uno no tiene m s remedio que amar a quien le impone humillaciones en virtud de su encanto y sta es una tr gica paradoja
9263174 el universo tiene un solo y espantoso secreto que es la ausencia de secretos
9263175 la vida consiste en el cumplimiento de inapelables directivas escritas previamente por un autor celeste
9263176 se equivoca uno al pensar que el amor y la muerte son dos destinos diferentes
9263177 nunca jam s se abandona lo que llorando se deja
9263178 bienaventurados los que han aprendido a llorar sin hacer preguntas
9263179 el arte es misterioso y conduce a la emoci n antes que al entendimiento
9263180 lo que existe y no se percibe bien podr a no existir
9263181 los nicos para sos que existen son los para sos perdidos
9263182 el amor de un poeta puede ser m s eficaz que un buen argumento
9263183 cualquier conducta lleva impl cita una renuncia a otra conducta posible
9263184 no hay peor cosa que un artista satisfecho de s mismo
9263185 vivimos entre los restos melanc licos de un prop sito maravilloso que sali mal
9263186 aprend el valor de la ausencia cualquier lugar es mejor apenas uno se va
9263187 toda alegr a no es m s que un olvido moment neo de la tragedia esencial de la vida
9263188 cuanto m s inteligente profunda y sensible es una persona m s probabilidades tiene de cruzarse con la tristeza
9263189 la inasistencia absoluta es imposible uno siempre est en alguna parte
9263190 un milagro es la negaci n de una met fora
9263191 la explicaci n metaf rica es una cobard a propia de quienes no se atreven ni a la fe ni a la incredulidad
9263192 es necesario evitar que el arte caiga en manos de los canallas no hay peor desgracia para la humanidad que un artista perverso
9263193 hay un verso que est siempre a punto de revel rsenos y que no escribiremos nunca
9263194 vivir no es otra cosa que una resistencia in til
9263195 deben existir personas excelentes que por discreci n por pudor o por el horror de lucirse aten an levemente sus virtudes no fingen maldad ni estupidez se limitan a descender un pelda o
9263196 la poes a es en verdad una invocaci n religiosa de la musa
9263197 no puede hablarse del placer de la creaci n art stica porque esta creaci n no siempre es placentera y la mayor a de las veces est rodeada de unas penurias tales que es necesario un enorme valor para evitar el desaliento
9263198 la musa es la mujer que uno ama el poeta inspirado se conecta con la diosa s lo a trav s de una mujer en la que ella reside hasta cierto punto un poeta verdadero se enamora absolutamente y su amor sincero es para l la encarnaci n de la musa
9263199 el azar no es m s que una consecuencia de la ignorancia
9263200 el universo es una organizaci n perversa donde siempre ocurre lo que uno no desea y donde todo acaba siempre en tragedia
9263201 la vida consiste en no saber qu es la vida
9263202 vivimos en un entrevero de predicados que pueden ser atribuidos a cualquiera
9263203 la preparaci n de una tristeza necesita de algunas alegr as
9263204 vivimos en v speras de sucesos que cuando ocurren resultan ser perpetuas v speras
9263205 la tarea de custodiar secretos genera prerrogativas para quienes la ejercen
9263206 no hay nada m s enojoso que una dama que se parece mucho a la mujer que uno ama
9263207 el arte debe diferenciarse de la realidad ya que esas diferencias son precisamente las que producen placer a los esp ritus sensibles es el artista y no la naturaleza el que decide el rumbo a seguir
9263208 cuando una ilusi n o un enga o producen los mismos efectos que los objetos reales entonces son reales
9263209 jam s sabremos c mo es el universo el resto de nuestros sentidos y el idioma contribuyen a completar este sue o de falsas apariencias que es nuestra percepci n cuanto menos sabemos menos nos hundimos en el error cuanto menos vemos m s cerca estamos de la verdad inconcebible
9263210 cada gesto de nuestra voluntad nos esclaviza cada deseo cumplido es una cadena cada orden que damos hace caer su peso sobre nosotros mismos
9263211 el arte es la rebeli n del hombre ante la malvada estupidez de los sucesos cotidianos
9263212 los artistas modificamos la realidad y triunfamos sobre ella si tomamos un palo y queremos que sea una espada ser una espada las obras terminan cuando nosotros queremos la vida en cambio sigue m s all de lo bello y lo bueno y termina en el momento menos conveniente deshilachada incompleta prosaica
9263213 la alucinaci n o percepci n de un objeto que no existe es un asunto que asegura la controversia perpetua
9263214 nos vemos a nosotros mismos como seres reales pero quiz somos nuestro propio y enga oso espejismo yo que me veo ahora denso y palpable soy sin embargo alucinaci n de m mismo
9263215 nuestro lugar est siempre vac o u ocupado por otras personas la serie de sustituciones es tan vertiginosa que no tenemos tiempo de ser nadie
9263216 nuestros m ritos son secretos a n para nosotros mismos nunca sabremos lo que hemos merecido porque no hay un jard n para los buenos versos ni un fuego eterno para los malos
9263217 en el humor como en el amor es preferible quedarse corto que saciarse
9263218 solo una vez en la vida de un hombre pasa un cent metro c bico de suerte y solo la pescar el que este todo el tiempo atento
9263219 salgamos de una vez a que nos peguen a que nos derroten a que nos traicionen cualquier cosa es preferible a sa mediocridad eficiente a sa miserable resignaci n que algunos llaman madurez
9263220 las aventuras verdaderamente grandes son aquellas que mejoran el alma de quien las vive
9263221 las personas decentes nos piden madurez y resignaci n quieren que olvidemos nuestras tr gicas enso aciones pero nosotros no queremos olvidar y el que olvide jam s jam s ser nuestro amigo ni siquiera cuando volvamos a encontrarnos otra vez y para siempre
9263222 pienso que el hombre vive inclinado hacia adelante hacia lo que no es hacia el amor que no tiene hacia el porvenir nos mueve el deseo de de lo no cumplido somos el deseo cuando las cosas se producen ya no son iguales
9263223 el hombre es una perpetua v spera es lo que es pero tambi n lo que todav a no es vive deseando y es l mismo su deseo
9263224 las musas existen existe desde luego el trabajo propio pero algunas cosas las recibe el artista desde afuera desde luego recibe lo que copia lo que lee recibe la influencia de otros escritores y de otros pensadores pero tambi n recibe impulsos extra os que no vienen de adentro voces extra as que le soplan en el o do cosas que tienen que ver incluso con el amor y con la muerte el amor y la muerte son dos musas muy potentes si no estuvi ramos obsesionados por el amor y si no fu ramos mortales dif cilmente escribir amos
9263225 la oscuridad le sirve principalmente al amante que no discrimina

9263263 the excellent weblog iowahawk summarized some of the thoughts i had i must also laud david burge of iowahawk for his gritty pragmatism he is no armchair crusader full of empty imprecations
9263264 if iowahawk ever decides to turn his guns on you accept your beating with good grace and a rueful chuckle if you try to fight back it only gets funnier
9263265 next time iowahawk beats up on you just take it if you try to fight back it only gets worse its like one of those monsters that the harder you fight it the stronger it gets because it actually feeds on your pathetic swats

9263277 hands down the best damn roadkill centric caucus coverage youll read
9263278 should be required reading for all students planning a career in journalism
9263279 inspired i was going to say parody but really it is far too close to the original to be called a parody really it is like the play hamlet stages to catch the conscience of the king a dramatic re enactment of the very crime claudius had committed but had yet to acknowledge it worked for hamlet will iowahawks performance work for the rest of us it is too early to tell but it is more truthful and far more amusing than anything youll read in the new york times

9263286 good thing that iowahawk exists otherwise wed have to invent him

9263481 milf units that targeted villages have engaged in serious violations of international law and should be held to account
9263482 but experience from around the world shows that the deployment of civilian militias can set off a chain of reprisals and only increases the danger facing civilians
9263483 all sides to this conflict should step back from the brink and demonstrate their commitment to avoid harming civilians the milf must control its forces and the philippine government should take responsibility for the security of all peoples in the philippines regardless of religion or ethnicity
9263484 we have to protect ourselves the military could not warrant our safety they come late

9263489 i was wounded on 28 may 1992 in my house which is in the centre of the city close to the presidency that was the night when the intelligence agencies caught a conversation between ratko mladic and one of his soldiers in which he orders his soldiers to burn part of the city and my house happened to be in this part of the city i was wounded taken to the hospital and stayed there for a month the bosnian serbs used a rocket launcher and shot with it through the city thirty six rockets were fired and one of these rockets fell in our apartment the previous day was the first massacre when people queueing for bread were shot at many were killed and injured the night i was injured there were many people like me and i was lying on a bed in the corridor of the hospital as there was no place in the rooms later i was transferred to a room with 48 other wounded people
9263490 the night i was admitted to hospital an elderly woman was admitted too she was wounded much worse than i the doctors were discussing in front of me what to do with the scarce resources they had whether to treat me first or her they decided to treat me first because i was young and had better chances of survival later in the night the older woman with whom i shared a bed as there were not enough beds died i spent the night in a bed drenched in blood next to a dead body i stayed in the hospital over a month to have my leg treated all the treatment was without anaesthesia
9263491 i believe in justice and i hope that his trial will allow us to learn something more about the reasons for the war and everything that happened in bosnia and herzegovina at the same time i am very suspicious that it can really bring us closure the war lasted so long nobody really helped the people during this period we waited so long for the arrest of karadzic and mladic is still free but the wounds not only those that we carry but the wounds are everywhere and this country is so fragile and i am not sure how much bright future we can have in this country as it is now so i am not sure that it will bring what we hoped for we were idealistic hoping that when karadzic and mladic are arrested that a new life will start for us this will not happen but we can at least hope that we can watch him in the trial and learn the truth about the many things that happened around us
9263492 people in the country realize that all the perpetrators will never face a trial like the man that shot me in the leg i will never learn who he was and what happened to him even though i would like to know i am following trials in the war crimes chambers on a daily basis and it is of huge importance the hague is very important but having the possibility to have the trials in the country where the crimes were perpetrated is very important for all of us it is a very important message not only for the people in bosnia but for the people in the whole world that it can be done it is still the whole process and the prosecution and the courts are still weak but they are getting stronger i hope that they will be stronger and able to deal with the most sensitive cases and the most important people who have committed war crimes this week 29 july the war crimes chamber pronounced the first genocide verdict in bosnia and herzegovina it was a verdict in the trial of 11 people who were accused of genocide committed after the fall of srebrenica seven of them were found guilty and they were sentenced to 42 years in prison
9263493 at this moment on state level the justice system is still not completely state owned because we still have international judges and prosecutors and the courts still depend on international donations it has to be a bosnia thing because it will demonstrate that this state wants to deal with war crimes on a local level much more is needed on a local level the system is underdeveloped the prosecution does not have enough capacity the courts do not have enough capacity they still do not have the possibility to offer witness protection much more has to be done on a local level than on a state level even though the state judiciary have to fight much more for their independence and the messages they are sending about the willingness to face the fathoms of the past
9263494 gathering and colluding to commit a crime against national security
9263495 we are forced to hold our meetings trainings and seminars in our homes but the security forces have worked hard to prevent us from even holding meetings in our own homes meetings have been broken up and members have been arrested

9263513 the system itself is stronger than it was before katrina
9263514 weve made great strides but were not there by any stretch of the imagination
9263515 as long as our hotels open and theres liquor were fine
9263516 the blood pressure reductions produced by valsartan were clinically relevant and did not cause adverse effects
9263517 as in other countries the primary caregivers of small children in afghanistan are their mothers however in this country mothers are subject to a number of restrictions in the decision making process regarding child healthcare
9263518 the poor economic and educational status of these women and their overall immaturity caused by a lack of learning opportunities may have resulted in difficulties in preventing illness in their children
9263519 culturally appropriate programmes with multifaceted approaches that provide families and communities with education and child marriage
9263520 current country wide efforts to ensure that all women have access to formal education the elimination of poverty and the improvement of sanitary conditions should be further enforced

9263534 parental leave policies in 21 countries assessing generosity and gender equality
9263535 when leave is transferable there is a greater likelihood that couples and companies alike will fall back on 1950s gender roles with mothers expected to take all of the time and fathers expected to take none
9263536 but since most men and women are now equally capable employees we should allow them to become equally capable parents
9263537 while the united states does a better job than many countries in allowing both men and women to utilize family leaves it also forces both men and women to make hard choices between their need to have income coming in and their need to spend time with their newborns
9263538 families need both time and money especially after the birth of a child
9263539 we found that most high income countries are able to guarantee both to new families
9263540 done properly parental leave policies arent a drag on the economy for example of the 19 rich countries with paid parental leave nine have an unemployment rate as low or lower than the united states

9263555 i have a hard time seeing how her qualifications stack up against the duties and responsibilities of being president i expect her to stick with simple truths when asked about continued american troop presence in iraq she said she knows only one thing about that i paraphrase no one has attacked the american homeland since george bush took the war to iraq
9263556 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president

9263568 with the lessons we learned from katrina and other hurricanes we feel that we are prepared to handle anything that is thrown at us
9263569 it is important to realize that while the governors husband is a member of a union this does not automatically qualify her for an on the job training program to become a heartbeat away from the presidency

9263582 while she is only in her second year as alaskas governor she has thus far shown herself to be a supporter of children and public education
9263583 in her less than two years as the states chief executive officer she was able to increase per pupil education spending and she is opposed to sending public money to support private schools through political schemes like vouchers
9263584 her selection however has certainly taken the issue of experience off the table for political debate
9263585 rnrn has been in communication with the community free clinics that arose from the aftermath of katrina and we will be monitoring the situation all throughout the labor day weekend to see when and if the services of our rn volunteers are needed
9263586 in the meantime we will be screening rns as to their availability and expertise
9263587 katrina revealed some ugly truths about our nations failure to care for its citizens in the wake of a natural disaster and here we go again
9263588 and we are still not prepared today we need a national healthcare system that has the capability of stepping in at the time of impact and providing the healthcare services needed
9263589 while we hope that our services arent needed we are ready willing and able to assist ifaw in helping animals and their owners should disaster strike
9263590 in situations like this we can only prepare for the worst and hope for the best we are happy to respond to the request for help from the state veterinarian of louisiana and plan to aid the state and its animal victims as swiftly and efficiently as possible

9263596 we need to talk about these things not just when a storm is staring us in the face and certainly not only after disaster strikes and another community is devastated

9263598 when appropriate wind resistance and flood elevation are originally built in to a structure it can provide effective passive protection for the people who live or work in that building
9263599 people need to know that the state or local building code is the minimum level of protection allowed by law fortunately there are builders who know how to can and want to build to an even higher safety standard ibhs is proud to work with many of these builders along the gulf coast as part of our fortified for safer living r program
9263600 an unfortunate fact in many areas just inland of the hurricane prone coastline is that homes and businesses have not been built to resist the kinds of strong winds that can occur when a hurricane rips across the coast and pushes inland
9263601 houston pops up as a prime example of this risky proposition while the texas department of insurance high wind standards have been implemented with varying degrees of success in coastal communities houston area homes and businesses have been built with little regard for hurricane winds mother nature frequently misses those memos and a strong storm barreling toward the coast can bring high winds well inland
9263602 we must get serious about spending the extra two percent to three percent it typically requires to properly connect the pieces of our houses together
9263603 louisiana stepped up and has adopted modern building codes throughout their state other states need to do the same until we do widespread but preventable structural damage will continue whenever the winds approach or exceed hurricane force
9263604 mezze in minneapolis a taste of the cuisine and culture of the arab world

9263610 shes a member of a pro woman but anti abortion group called feminists for life i believe in the strength and the power of women and the potential of every human life she said
9263611 it is unprecedented to see the platforms of both major u s political parties incorporate key pieces of ffls unique message
9263612 of course there is a certain excitement about the recent movement toward ffls woman centered solutions and message by the parties and now the selection of a pro life feminist as the vice presidential nominee but as a nonpartisan organization we cannot endorse any candidates
9263613 ffl members represent a broad political as well as religious spectrum and we remain both nonpartisan and nonsectarian there are many issues outside feminists for lifes mission feminists for life is dedicated to systematically eliminating the root causes that drive women to abortion primarily lack of practical resources and support through holistic woman centered solutions we recognize that abortion is a reflection that our society has failed to meet the needs of women and that too often women have settled for less women deserve better than abortion

9263632 take pictures and then email them to relatives living out of state a home inventory will help you replace your belongings faster
9263633 plan ahead and map out a safe and smooth evacuation route and please follow any evacuation orders
9263634 things can be replaced nothing is worth putting yourself or your family in harms way
9263635 it is also a good idea to have emergency supplies such as flashlights radio batteries and water on hand if you live in a hurricane prone area
9263636 we recommend installing storm shutters to protect your windows or nailing plywood panels to your window frames when a storm approaches
9263637 it is also a good idea to cover your sliding doors with plywood and to replace old garage doors and tracks with a door that is approved for both wind pressure and impact protection
9263638 if wind comes into your home through a large opening it increases your chances of major damage to the rest of your home especially your roof

9263640 it fulfills a critical need in tanzania where we have been improving health systems not only for people with hiv but also for those with other chronic health issues as well

9263649 many clinicians lack knowledge about how to identify smokers quickly and easily which treatments are effective how such treatments can be delivered and the relative effectiveness of different treatments
9263650 indiana data show that even brief interventions by our doctors dentists nurses and assistants can increase the number of hoosiers who try to quit
9263651 these new guidelines provide a blueprint for clinicians and health care systems describing how smokers can access effective treatments how clinicians can provide such treatments quickly and effectively and how health care systems can support both smokers and clinicians in smoking cessation efforts were pleased to award a grant to clarian health to begin implementing these practices
9263652 nicotine addiction often requires repeated intervention and multiple attempts to quit which is why support from health care providers is essential
9263653 identifying smokers and providing them with brief advice and help with quitting in clinical practice are both very effective and cost effective
9263654 tobacco cessation is among the top three highest priority and cost effective preventive services as a healthcare professional i found this to be true very early in my practice as a respiratory therapist while we are asking about smoking status national benchmarks show there is much room for improvement in delivering cessation assistance the community intervention trial for smoking cessation commit showed that 75 percent of people were being asked about use 49 percent advised to quit and only 25 percent being offered assistance like medications when more than 60 percent of our smokers want to quit we as health professionals need to be providing the means to assist them it has become clear over the last decade that providing smoking cessation counseling may be similar to that of annual colon cancer screening annual flu vaccinations mammograms and cholesterol screening this is why the clarian tobacco control center has launched an effort to assist healthcare providers in integrating evidence based components that will allow them to provide brief cessation intervention

9263680 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9263681 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok

9263690 what one skill if you developed and did it in an excellent fashion would help you the most in your career
9263691 the more you invest in yourself the more you will believe in yourself
9263692 to change anything in your outer world you must begin by changing what is going on in your inner world
9263693 a person who takes a single action as the result of a new idea or insight is far more valuable than the person who learns a hundred ideas but does nothing
9263694 the more attention you pay to your day to day spending the smarter you will become about the amount of money flowing through your fingers
9263695 perform more and more task of higher value and delegate delay outsource and eliminate tasks of lower value
9263696 concentrate single mindedly on one thing the most important thing all day long
9263697 essentially there are only four different things you can do to improve the quality of your life and work
9263698 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9263699 the alaska republican political machine is so rife with corruption that it makes chicago look clean its quite possible that palin bears no taint or both a oily gop slime machine and a dem slime machine will emerge to tar her unjustly showing the real ugly side of usa politics but it will be interesting to see what comes up and how thoroughly palin whose name kay bailey hutchison did not know how to pronounce was vetted
9263700 bushs job is to figure out a way to pass the torch in a way that does the least damage
9263701 it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9263702 he knows its not his convention hes had two of them and hell behave accordingly
9263703 help me shake up washington and make it start working again for the people
9263704 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9263705 as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need
9263706 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9263707 america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9263708 give her the reward she has earned and let her works bring her praise at the city gate
9263709 though we live in an era of worry over faceless internet predators and web identity thieves we can be at our most vulnerable face to face
9263710 all the cleaning all the laundry and all the vacuuming
9263711 this is ridiculous i should have known to expect this before we even had a baby ive tried to get even with him by just not doing the chores but he is happy to live in filth and squalor
9263712 typically her only solution is to fly into a rage and scream and yell and hell usually responds with minimal effort while acting like she is just unreasonable for expecting him to do even some of the housework
9263713 lady you need to get out of that house now
9263714 there has got to be a better way of living
9263715 space you dont fool me youre not a something youre nothing
9263716 every time something separates it becomes clearer what something is for then the different kinds of somethings can be compared therefore i will know myself better the more i divide into new kinds of something
9263717 this is nothing until now every time we separate something we found higher states of something but now we have found nothing so what happens if we separate nothing
9263718 nou slaap lekker dan nog bel ik wel een andere keer terug
9263719 the bullet was leaving the barrel just fine the trouble must have been at the other end

9263722 weeds are just uninvited guests at the organised nature party you call your garden
9263723 you have to go to millions of art schools to be accepted by an art gallery trying different drawings techniques and styles has been my art school
9263724 its difficult to say why people like abstract work is it the combination of colour or is it the composition maybe im a bit conservative on that matter but i think that before you do abstract works you have to do more traditional kinds of art work at least know how to draw go to an art school and if you dont go at least do something in your house learn to draw and draw a lot learn new stuff an artist has to give from himself
9263725 people are being more carefully selective about where theyre sending their tzedakah
9263726 everybody is feeling it and everybody is going to feel it were getting less funds in to local charities and many more requests
9263727 people dont realize that there are a lot of neighbors that need their help
9263728 a person who gave 100 last year gave 50 this year one who gave 500 last year is only giving 180 this year the number of donors hasnt decreased but theyre giving less than two or three years ago

9263733 our goal is to offer them assistance in a practical way
9263734 not just supporting one another but trying to use the structure of the kehillah and families that want to help each single parent will have a buddy family from the kehillah thats the goal the parents need an advocate being a single parent is very difficult we will try to do anything to minimize the challenge and make it easier
9263735 that they have someone they can count on its a talented close knit kehillah people will drop everything to help someone else
9263736 my daughters are the only ones in their grade from a divorced family they feel different the initiative is very helpful they do many different things they helped children from divorced families meet they know that they are not the only ones
9263737 they see the needs of the community and address those needs
9263738 for me its a scary experience without prior knowledge its even scarier we are trying to build a network we call each other some are further along and can give advice a book to read recommend a lawyer
9263739 its to raise awareness more of a friend helping a friend a shul member helping a shul member it should be a community wide effort we need all shuls to be involved they may be single but they are not alone and they shouldnt have to deal with the challenges themselves
9263740 getting hit in the head with a two by four
9263741 i was the only possible donor there were no other close matches
9263742 so how can you live with yourself knowing you could have helped someone and you didnt
9263743 all i can really think of is thanks for saving my life its hard to say much more than that
9263744 they are careful about informing you and insuring your safety

9263752 his own iniquities entrap the wicked man amp he is caught in the cords of his sin
9263753 for i see that you are poisoned by bitterness and bound by iniquity
9263754 for we ourselves were also once foolish disobedient deceived slaving various lusts and pleasures
9263755 they themselves are slaves of corruption for by whom a person is overcome by him also he is brought into bondage
9263756 you meant evil against me but god meant it for good in order to bring it about as it is this day to save many people alive
9263757 but i will harden his pharaohs heart so that he will not let the people go
9263758 and the lord had given the people favor in the sight of the egyptians so that they granted them what they requested thus they plundered the egyptians
9263759 and i indeed will harden the hearts of the egyptians and they shall follow them so i will gain honor over pharaoh and over all his army his chariots and his horsemen
9263760 but sihon king of heshbon would not let us pass through for the lord your god hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate that he might deliver him into your hand
9263761 for it was of the lord to harden their hearts that they should come against israel in battle that he might utterly destroy them
9263762 god sent a spirit of ill will between abimelech and the men of shechem and the men of shechem dealt treacherously with abimelech
9263763 the anger of the lord was aroused against israel and he moved david against them to say go number israel and judah
9263764 the lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these prophets
9263765 that the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah might be fulfilled the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom
9263766 the lord made them joyful and turned the heart of the king of assyria toward them to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of god
9263767 he turned their heart to hate his people to deal craftily with his servants
9263768 a mans heart will plans his way but the lord directs his steps
9263769 the kings heart will is in the hand of the lord he turns it wherever he wishes pr 21 1
9263770 woe to assyria the rod of my anger i will send him against an ungodly nation and against the people of my wrath i will give him charge yet he does not mean so nor does his heart think so
9263771 for the lord of hosts has purposed and who will annul it his hand is stretched out and who will turn it back
9263772 who says of cyrus he is my shepherd and he shall perform all my pleasure
9263773 i will give them one heart and one way that they may fear me forever
9263774 i will put my fear in their hearts so that they will not depart from me
9263775 i will give you a new heart will and put a new spirit within you i will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart will of flesh i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you will keep my judgments and do them
9263776 for his dominion is and everlasting dominion and his kingdom is from generation to generation
9263777 for truly against your holy servant jesus whom you anointed both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the people of israel were gathered together to do whatever your hand and your purpose determined before to be done
9263778 and we know that all things work together for good to those who love god to those who are the called according to his purpose
9263779 why does he still find fault for who has resisted his will
9263780 but one and the same spirit works all these things distributing to each one individually as he wills
9263781 for it is god who works in you both to will and to do for his good pleasure
9263782 instead you ought to say if the lord wills we shall live and do this or that
9263783 for god has put it into their hearts to fulfill his purpose to be of one mind and to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of god are fulfilled
9263784 adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god
9263785 then the lord god called to adam and said to him where are you
9263786 for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die
9263787 you who were dead in trespasses and sins even when you were dead in trespasses made us alive together with christ
9263788 and you being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh he has made alive
9263789 yet the lord has not given you a heart to perceive amp eyes to see amp ears to hear
9263790 i speak to them in parables because seeing they do not see and hearing they do not hear nor do they understand for the hearts of this people have grown dull their ears are hard of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears lest they should understand with their hearts and turn so that i should heal them
9263791 therefore they could not believe because isaiah said again he has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts lest they should see with their eyes lest they should understand with their hearts and turn so that i should heal them
9263792 to open their eyes in order to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan to god that they may receive forgiveness of sins
9263793 but even if our gospel is veiled it is veiled to those who are perishing whose minds the god of this age has blinded who do not believe lest the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image of god should shine on them
9263794 yet the lord has not given you a heart to perceive amp eyes to see amp ears to hear
9263795 i speak to them in parables because seeing they do not see and hearing they do not hear nor do they understand for the hearts of this people have grown dull their ears are hard of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears lest they should understand with their hearts and turn so that i should heal them
9263796 then the lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually
9263797 men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil
9263798 for everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light
9263799 i was found by those who did not seek me i was made manifest to those who did not ask for me
9263800 but you do not believe because you are not of my sheep
9263801 who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god
9263802 it is not of him who wills nor of him who runs but of god who shows mercy
9263803 of his own will he brought us forth birthed us by the word of truth
9263804 if fallen dead deaf blind sinners cant come to christ then how do they come to christ
9263805 he chose us in him before the foundation of the world having predestined us to adoption as sons by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will
9263806 in him also we have obtained an inheritance being predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will
9263807 god from the beginning chose you for salvation through sanctification by the spirit and belief in the truth
9263808 you did not choose me but i chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit
9263809 paul called to be an apostle of jesus christ through the will of god
9263810 and we know that all things work together for good to those who love god to those who are the called according to his purpose
9263811 who has saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given to us in christ jesus before time began
9263812 he opened their understanding that they might comprehend the scriptures
9263813 the lord opened her heart to heed the things spoken by paul
9263814 nor does anyone know the father except the son and the one to whom the son wills to reveal him
9263815 no one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him
9263816 moreover whom he predestined these he also called whom he called these he also justified and whom he justified these he also glorified
9263817 and as many as had been appointed to eternal life believed
9263818 concerning the election they are beloved for the sake of the fathers for the gifts and the calling of god are irrevocable
9263819 him god has exalted to his right hand to be prince and savior to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins
9263820 god has also granted to the gentiles repentance to life
9263821 those who are in opposition if god perhaps will grant them repentance so that they may know the truth
9263822 for by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest anyone should boast
9263823 for to you it has been granted on behalf of christ not only to believe in him but also to suffer
9263824 god from the beginning chose you for salvation through sanctification by the spirit and belief in the truth
9263825 every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and comes down from the father of lights
9263826 looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith
9263827 to those who have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god
9263828 i planted apollos watered but god gave the increase so then neither he who plants is anything nor he who waters but god who gives the increase
9263829 for who makes you differ and what do you have that you did not receive now if you did indeed receive it why do you boast as if you had not received it 1 cor 4 7
9263830 but by the grace of god i am what i am
9263831 for by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest anyone should boast

9263951 coaching kids of all levels on teams and at camps gave me a chance to try what i learned and believe and guess what it worked
9263952 the more i studied the game the more i read and saw from the huge amount of work that a 150 year old game can produce the more i believed in the things that my dad mr bahr kal csapo ron quinn and jerry sheska always told me
9263953 the overriding reason i did the stoners is because i want local kids to be fortunate enough to experience what i did in my life with soccer
9263954 the fault was purely mine i wanted to get the stoners started with the group of boys that played for the mssl side over the last few years as a result i rushed into it and wasnt careful enough to make sure the people in the group had the same soccer vision i had
9263955 the reserve program was central to what i thought our vision was in terms of a community based team and the set up of a professional organization
9263956 from the beginning it was meant to spark and carry out a cultural mission as much as anything else the other folks in the group had no idea of the concept and their subsequent actions surrounding the reserve side proved it
9263957 in retrospect i really couldnt have expected the other stoners guys to understand
9263958 they are all smart hardworking guys but their soccer understanding is based on far less study and experience it was wrong for me to get people into the stoners who have no concept of the level of soccer i was hoping to accomplish there
9263959 id be lying if i said it was great leaving i felt great for the success of the kids i knew from before about 8 9 of the kids on the playoff roster played for me before it is also important to note that i have no issues with the coaching staff they are who they are as are we all my only issues were with the board
9263960 its important not to confuse the present team with anything that went before the stoners name was chosen only because it had a tie to the past that was viewed favorably in the area the stoners team was meant to be a start towards learning what pro soccer is all about it is unfair to compare these boys with another time
9263961 our opportunities were different we had to learn to be professionals with little time to ramp up we were able to because we had a coach whod been there could surround us with quality pros and could ramp up our game
9263962 im helping some really top notch soccer folks to bring npsl and wpsl teams to the poconos for 2009
9263963 with an eye to introducing real professional soccer in the lehigh valley within a couple of years one of the group has tremendous ties with incredible people at all levels of sports in the us
9263964 the group will have three ex stoners board members three ex stoners professional players two ex stoners coaches and other folks with the experience perspective and understanding of what it takes to develop a soccer culture and club
9263965 in addition to all of the important soccer mad poconos residents five people with national level us soccer licenses will be on board as will the man who scouted and coached kaka for sao paulo and worked recently for lokomotiv moscow a fifa agent and affiliations with the top clubs in europe we will form a ypsl youth summer league in concert with local youth organizations and run a reserve program
9263966 the goal in addition to starting a new soccer culture is to give everyone the best shot at advancing their game to their highest possible level

9264050 i really enjoyed the video clips you used to illustrate your points your examples and anecdotes were also very relevant generally the pace of the session was just right there was a good mix of teacher talk and activity the messages delivered through the session were relevant e g there is diversity of skills present in a group that one should harness ones strengths etc there was concern that the profiling might lead to stereotyping and pigeon holing that pupils might get carried away with what they are bee hoon etc and fail to learn the more important messages behind the profiling there should be opportunities for application of skills learnt so that pupils do not just gain head knowledge the workshop would be useful in creating self awareness amongst pupils it could also include teaching of practical skills and strategies for teambuilding e g managing conflicts etc thank you so much for doing the sharing during the meeting your enthusiasm for what youre doing is very inspiring

9264110 container ships bringing goods to the u s from china used to travel back home empty today if you want to ship overseas you have to reserve a container well in advance
9264111 the overwhelming story is that the export numbers have offset domestic weakness in consumer spending and business investment
9264112 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
9264113 the birth of americas large scale commercial ice industry began in new england in 1805 frederick tudor a boston merchant created the first natural ice business in the united states he shipped ice harvested on a pond in lynn massachusetts to the west indies over the next thirty years tudor made a fortune shipping ice around the world to places like charleston new orleans cuba calcutta south america china and england british records show that queen victoria purchased some ice from massachusetts in the 1840s
9264114 between the revolution and the civil war america flourished not in discovery but in search it prospered not from the perfection of its ways but from their fluidity it lived with the constant belief that something else or something better might turn up

9264117 you have enough eyewitnesses here let me leave you my card and you can call if you need me hm
9264118 where have you been why werent you at the press conference were you in there when stonagal offed himself and took the brit with him you should have been here
9264119 theres prestige for us having you in there how are you going to convince anybody you were in there when you didnt show up for the press conference cameron whats the deal
9264120 how are you going to convince anybody you were in there
9264121 i hurried back here to get the story into the system
9264122 well if you were here then you probably know what happened before the press conference
9264123 youre not following me buck im saying if you were here for the press conference you heard about the stonagal suicide in the preliminary meeting the one you were supposed to come to
9264124 i wasnt at the press conference steve but i was in the room when stonagal and todd cothran died
9264125 i dont have time for this buck its not funny
9264126 whats the deal with you not even going to that meeting
9264127 yeah i saw you you were that close what did you do find something more important to do you got some fast talking to do cameron
9264128 im telling you i was there ill show you my credentials
9264129 i just checked the credential list and youre not on it
9264130 of course im on it ill show em to you
9264131 your names there im saying but its not checked off
9264132 mr bailey im looking at my credentials right now theyre in my hand
9264133 your credentials dont mean dirt if you didnt use em cameron
9264134 i just talked to three four people who were there including a u n guard and carpathias personal assistant not to mention plank none of them saw you you werent there
9264135 personnel says there is nobody in the new york police department named cenni and there never has been
9264136 either everyone else has gone mad and he alone has kept his sanity or else the other way around
9264137 face it edward its not that weve all turned into teddy bears its that youve gone crazy
9264138 all play and no work makes buck a dull boy
9264139 were cops we interview everybody especially people whore in a hurry to leave murder scenes
9264140 all buck could do now was try to convince stanton bailey
9264141 be about bearing in mind it also contains the phrase
9264142 mr bailey im looking at my credentials right now theyre in my hand
9264143 your credentials dont mean dirt if you didnt use em cameron
9264144 is it safe to assume that nothing further is ever revealed about this mystery
9264145 i dont want any more of this nonsense about your having been there i know you were in the building and i see your credentials but you know and i know and everyone who was in there know you werent i dont know what you thought was more important but you were wrong this is unacceptable and unforgivable cameron i cant have you as my executive editor
9264146 cant go along with that either pal i want you out of new york im going to put you in the chicago bureau
9264147 you dont get it do you cameron i dont trust you i should fire you but i know youd just wind up with somebody else
9264148 good because if you tried to jump to the competition id have to tell them about this stunt youre going to be a staff writer out of chicago working for the woman who was lucindas assistant there itll mean a whopping cut in pay especially considering what you wouldve gotten with the promotion that was the sorriest excuse for news gathering ive ever seen and by one of the best in the business
9264149 buck is saved and nicolae is a bad man with strange powers
9264150 because buck is a main character and thus immune to the feeble spells and weapons of the antichrist he is not as protected as rayford steele spoilers but he has more than enough authorial intervention mojo to shield him for at least another nine books
9264151 to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare senator mccain to candidate mccain
9264152 candidate mccain now supports the wartime tax cuts that senator mccain once denounced as immoral
9264153 candidate mccain says he would now vote against the immigration bill that sen mccain wrote
9264154 are you kidding talk about being for it before youre against it
9264155 let me tell you before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
9264156 and whats more senator mccain who once railed against the smears of karl rove when he was the target has morphed into candidate mccain who is using the same rove tactics and the same rove staff to repeat the same old politics of fear and smear
9264157 barack obama has seen farther thought harder and listened better and time and again barack obama has been proven right
9264158 nou dan heb ik een fijne boodschap voor u uw abonnement gaat flink goedkoper worden
9264159 you make a big election about small things and you know what its worked before because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government when washington doesnt work all its promises seem empty if your hopes have been dashed again and again then its best to stop hoping and settle for what you already know i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
9264160 without doubt the current climate is tough and it is likely to get tougher
9264161 but all the evidence in previous recessions shows that demand for budget hotels remains very strong during a downturn people still have to travel and they will trade down
9264162 a number of independent reports tell us that demand for the budget sector should remain strong we have not scaled back our plans and we will still have a modest market share
9264163 it doesnt matter much what facilities there are once the lights are out
9264164 we have brought people in from the three and four star hotels and many in that sector are actually quite poor
9264165 they usually want to complicate the operation by adding services we dont need
9264166 while demand is good in the budget sector i see some of my competitors adding complexity to the business of course you need to give the customer a warm welcome and a clean room and there are some things we could not leave out if we ever took the tea and coffee facilities away there would be uproar
9264167 we open one hotel every six days and there will be 18 in december alone
9264168 i hold my hands up but if someone is providing us with labour that is trained for our needs and people who want to work then why not do it
9264169 in many cases you have people who have either never worked or have been out of work for some time maybe they are single parents or have a disability whatever the case they are often grateful to have a job and some self respect and they are delighted to have the opportunity
9264170 quite frankly we are frustrated and disillusioned with the way the proposals have been put together and the way the consultation has taken place
9264171 higher prices may affect consumption but not necessarily among the groups the government wishes to target the creation of a separate aisle may just drive people into different shopping patterns
9264172 we believe the most effective approach to promoting the highest standards of responsible behaviour across industry and for every consumer is through a fair transparent and effective system of co regulation
9264173 alcohol misuse costs scotland at least 2 25bn every year and its affecting our health service our criminal justice system and our economy its not the drink its how were drinking it and we need to take action now to rebalance our relationship with alcohol
9264174 weve outlined a bold package of measures from minimum pricing to tackling irresponsible promotions which together we think can start to change scotlands relationship with alcohol for the better
9264175 we depend on land for the food on our table and the energy we consume it dictates how we live it is home to our unique flora and fauna however so far little has been done to examine how best these competing pressures can be managed as a whole it is essential that we look at how we use rural land to everyones benefit
9264176 food supply has come back into prominence however at the same time we are witnessing the exodus from the hills of large numbers of people and livestock
9264177 this has potentially devastating implications both environmentally and socially in these fragile communities we must look at how to arrest that decline to save scotlands landscapes and food production resources
9264178 from a trading perspective the group has done well against a challenging consumer backdrop

9264183 each day many people use the perry farm grounds farm display renovations walking areas and the farm museum for young people
9264184 hopefully they will be able to see more of the genuine articles that once made up the perry farm home
9264185 we are in the early stages of making the perry farm house a museum
9264186 the purpose of bringing these items back here is to preserve the past and educate the public so they can learn about the perry house
9264187 our goal is to educate the youth on farmland since we live in a small community surrounded by farmland
9264188 obviously i had never heard of her before but i trust mccains judgment on so many other things that i will trust him on this one
9264189 this is another way of reaching out and drawing in resources that havent been tapped
9264190 shes going to be good because shes a normal person
9264191 i dont see how she can match what biden can offer
9264192 im going to have a hard time now not voting for obama
9264193 i would be able to cheer for either team if they made the world series mostly because i would like to see some success in chicago
9264194 i have been a fan of both teams for as long as i can remember
9264195 i cheer for the cubs when the two teams play
9264196 i will do it for the history of wrigley for the honor of my dad and my uncles whove passed on but would have loved to see it happen and for the fans whove been committed to them for so long especially people who have very little hope in their lives or are sick elderly or alone and love the cubs
9264197 its more than fanfare for the players they are doing their job and seem to care
9264198 its time they get to feel what white sox fans felt in 2005
9264199 even though im a lifelong cubs fan i did root for the sox in 2005
9264200 i was born on the south side of chicago and still work there
9264201 their team chemistry is impeccable they have one of the best bullpens in baseball and they have a solid core of young talent surrounded by a group of seasoned veterans
9264202 and of course ozzie guillen the fieriest manager in baseball with an uncanny ability to bring his team together and enhance the intensity of the game
9264203 granted they have lots of talent but their team chemistry isnt quite there
9264204 i dont think they can compete with the american league
9264205 after all the cubs were swept by the tampa bay rays
9264206 in 2003 i bought discounted white sox tickets through my workplace and i thought my boyfriend jeff might like to go
9264207 he told me that the white sox were not winning much but we knew wed have fun going just to watch live baseball
9264208 we want to be the go to web destination for anything related to kankakee county
9264209 while many community sites provide a piece of the puzzle you should be able to start at mykankakeecounty com and either find the information youre looking for or find a link to a site that gets you to it
9264210 i dont know what it would take to truly change the dynamics of springfield
9264211 what he should do is move on to another career
9264212 with numbers like that i dont know how anybody could be serious about re election
9264213 theres more to do and i have no reason to think i dont want to keep doing this job
9264214 people are going to truly look within the democratic party for a leader that can bring people together with the same message obama brings into the world this week
9264215 i dont think that he will be successful running for a third term if hes under incitement for political corruption
9264216 the cop said we needed a permit to knock on doors

9264230 non rimpianger mai il tempo passato insieme a te non dimenticher neppure un secondo anche se ogni attimo di quel tempo stato un attimo rubato un falso attimo di gioia che nascondeva la pi grande delle bugie ora la ferita sembra rimarginata ma non posso pi guardarti negli occhi e sentirmi felice perch ogni volta che incrocio i tuoi occhi non posso non rivedere quelle immagini e non posso non risentire echeggiare nella mente quella frase che ha distrutto un castello di sabbia gi per met annientato dimenticami scott te lo chiedo per favore anche se conoscendoti ti sar impossibile farlo allora non dimenticarmi ma lasciami vivere la mia vita lontano da te lontano dalla persona che pi amo e odio al mondo sentimenti che non riesco a far convivere nel mio cuore chiss forse il destino ci metter nuovamente sulla stessa strada e allora questo sar un arrivederci o forse non ci incontreremo pi e allora questo sar il mio ultimo addio un bacio k
9264231 at 5 50 a glass thats all i can afford on the way back we did what we often did when we returned home to kankakee following a game we stopped at white castle
9264232 dr kings legacy is living through barack obama and all those who support him and his vision for a better america for all americans
9264233 it was an excellent speech and an exciting time he more than got his point across
9264234 it was not an elegant speech but that may have been on purpose
9264235 his attacks on mccain were pretty tough and thats the one element of his speech where he was in danger of conflicting with his brand
9264236 he was very detailed with what he wanted to accomplish during his administration
9264237 if you listened and youre in the middle class of america you would be hard pressed not to be behind barack he laid out what he was going to do from education to the work environment it was a very powerful speech
9264238 what has he done to make changes nothing he has been the senator of illinois for two years and he failed to make the changes he talked about what has he accomplished for us
9264239 barack obama raised the bar again last night in his speech it was a superb speech in all aspects he laid out the details of his plan and all the pundits and naysayers have heard how he will address the issues of this campaign
9264240 he talked about tax cuts coming to working class americans and not the upper echelons of society on health care education and infrastructure needs he laid out all his plans
9264241 even surrounded by 80 000 people you could heard a pin drop in that stadium thats how intensely people were listening to his speech
9264242 i thought it was a phenomenal exercise of communication with all americans it was very insightful and he succeeded in detailing the mission of his presidency i feel that his vision for improving our international relations and setting a domestic agenda for middle american were the most important aspects of his change for america theme
9264243 no matter how mad you get you come right back to them
9264244 they have their head cases like carlos zambrano but when hes on hes one of the best
9264245 i dont think the sox have the want to at this point
9264246 our pitching staff is having a good year and our roster is also getting healthy
9264247 i got really involved three or four years ago and got hooked on it
9264248 i know there are many fans who have endured the pain for much longer than that
9264249 there are probably a few who were there in 1908
9264250 as lou piniella says this team has good pitching defense and timely hitting
9264251 they would have to sustain all three elements at the same time to win a world series and at times the hitting and pitching are inconsistent
9264252 the american league doesnt play real baseball by using the designated hitter
9264253 its a completely different style of baseball that takes the manager out of the game regarding decision making and moves
9264254 we need more troops more helicopters better intelligence gathering and more nonmilitary assistance to accomplish the mission there i will not hold our military our resources and our foreign policy hostage to a misguided desire to maintain permanent bases in iraq
9264255 return our national guard and reserve to its traditional mission which is primarily one of homeland security
9264256 while economic development is alive and well throughout kankakee county i am a bit perplexed by the fact that many of the contractors and workers are coming from outside the area
9264257 we need local jobs for local people who get paid area standards with good benefits
9264258 only then does economic development benefit the entire community and county and not a select few
9264259 the options this board will face will not be pleasant
9264260 well have to start thinking in terms of what we can cut
9264261 this positive balance is actually on the backs of the bonds you issued
9264262 i think you have reached the pinnacle in increases in the reserve funds
9264263 there has been a lot of cutting already done in this budget it is conservative
9264264 we shut down work wednesday and are waiting for an analysis of the material
9264265 probably more like a 10 percent increase from a year ago
9264266 we want to take actions to make sure it doesnt happen again
9264267 he couldnt find an adult he was comfortable talking to
9264268 well go over with all the children what they should do it they find themselves in this situation
9264269 we have had students on a wrong bus before but they were able to find an adult
9264270 the governors actions will put abused and neglected children at greater risk reduce access to medicaid and food stamps and further harm state parks and historic sites
9264271 he went after programs and services that truly affect peoples lives
9264272 its unfortunate to cut jobs when were understaffed in many different areas then to cut more doesnt make any sense
9264273 the governor has to make tough decisions its not easy to be governor but thats his responsibility
9264274 were in an economic downturn in illinois and the governments grown too much
9264275 we picked the parks to close based in part on attendance we also looked to see if the population area was served by another park nearby
9264276 we are dealing with the hand that is before us and we worked very hard with the governors office to minimize the impact of these cuts
9264277 our union will do everything possible to prevent layoffs protect our members and restore public services but we cant do it alone
9264278 the public needs to insist that child protection human services state parks and illinois history are too important to fall victim to the governors budget axe lawmakers should return to springfield as soon as possible to take whatever action is necessary to fix the budget and stop these cuts
9264279 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9264280 if they say we cant guarantee your safety you dont go
9264281 i think we are looking at something like 4 hours of tailgating prior to the concert 8 of us are going and we should be pretty
9264282 we were expecting a big group and they were a lot bigger than we had expected
9264283 the internal building is full and we have no more classrooms
9264284 if were looking at enrollment growth in the future well have to make some decisions about how to use that space
9264285 we can probably squeeze out two extra classrooms by moving teachers
9264286 i think people are fed up they are offended that so many chicago politicians seem to think they have a right to hand down a public office to their children
9264287 they dont trust us things like handing off a seat and carving voters out of the process makes it hard for them to trust us
9264288 if your dads a fireman youre going to be interested in being a firefighter if your dads a construction worker youre going to be interested in construction
9264289 whenever this happens it hits a nerve with the public
9264290 what tends to get peoples goats is when it appears to be very blatant when its their son or daughter
9264291 can you imagine what it would be like to spend your entire life locked in a cage like environment thinking that is all that existed there is a certain comfort in being trapped and not realizing it it would get meals and water and attention then suddenly it finds a freedom that it never realized existed its small world expands incomprehensibly it meets others who are exactly like it that it had never seen before i would be completely petrified if that happened to me wouldnt you
9264292 what joy there is today it is a time of special celebration for today holds out the instant to the darkened world where its release is set the day has come when sorrows pass away and pain is gone the glory of salvation dawns today upon a world set free this is the time of hope for countless millions they will be united now as you forgive them all for i will be forgiven by you today
9264293 we have forgiven one another now and so we come at last to you again father your son who never left returns to heaven and his home how glad are we to have our sanity restored to us and to remember that we all are one
9264294 if i dont get out of this this day is going to be terrible
9264295 then why are you going youre crazy youre in horrible shape youll never make it
9264296 look at me im sitting on the steps doing an abbott and costello routine with jesus i must really be going crazy
9264297 is this how you plan on spending labor day laboring to the top of a mountain you could just spend it lying on the beach
9264298 and so we give today to you we come with wholly open minds we do not ask for anything that we may think we want give us what you would have received by us you know all our desires and our wants and you will give us everything we need in helping us to find the way to you
9264299 reverse engines it is come out the way it came in
9264300 it seemed so promising mirrors sprawled across desert land in the scorching south west delivering clean electricity and helping to wean americans off imported fossil fuels
9264301 further dampening hopes for a big solar energy boom the federal bureau of land management blm has abruptly slapped a moratorium on new applications to put solar collectors on federal land the agency says it has a backlog of more than 130 applications and needs to conduct a region wide environmental impact study on the industry before it will accept any more the study will take 22 months to complete however few argue against trying to preserve precious water sources and protect desert tortoises and other creatures that might not enjoy cohabiting with sprawling fields of mirrors but many solar advocates wonder why the government is not acting as cautiously when it comes to drilling for oil and gas
9264302 senator maria cantwell a democrat from washington state wants a congressional probe into the proposed moratorium the fact that the blm pops this out without people even knowing about it especially when solar thermal looks extremely promising as a baseload power source is not right she says harry reid of nevada who is the majority leader in the senate also condemns the blms freeze saying that it could slow new development to a crawl the blm is not without its supporters however at a public meeting on june 23rd in golden colorado alex daue of the wilderness society said that his organisation supports renewable energy development as long as it doesnt damage other important resources the message is clear no rubber stamps even for renewable energy
9264303 the main impediment to the widespread use of solar power clouds and nightfall aside is the cost of the silicon cells that actually convert the suns rays into electricity to keep the expense down people have been searching for ways to minimise the size of solar panels relative to the amount of light they can harvest often this is done using clunky pieces of kit called solar trackers which tilt an array of mirrors so as to direct large amounts of sunlight onto small high performance cells such trackers however are expensive to install and run and are prone to heat the cells up too much which reduces their efficiency and may damage them that in turn means the cells have to be fitted with pricey cooling systems an alternative now being tested is called the luminescent solar concentrator lsc instead of focusing the suns rays on a cell as a solar tracker does an lsc first traps them wherever they have come from and then delivers them to the cell using what is known as a waveguide no moving parts are involved
9264304 many researchers around the world are working on lscs the latest group to report in a paper in this weeks science is led by michael currie and jonathan mapel of the massachusetts institute of technology they reckon they can triple the efficiency of such devices and thus launch them on the path to success a standard lsc is made of a sheet of plastic containing molecules of dye and stretched within a frame that is in effect a single long thin solar cell the dye absorbs incoming sunlight and then re emits it the re emitted light is trapped inside the plastic sheet by a process called total internal reflection which causes it to bounce between the sheets surfaces without being able to escape and thus guides it towards the circumferential solar cell optical fibres work in a similar way alas this approach too has its limits in particular some of the light is reabsorbed as it bounces around and is lost as heat the more dye molecules there are the more light is lost on the other hand you want a lot of dye molecules in order to absorb a lot of light in the first place a difficult balance has to be struck dr currie and dr mapel think they have found a way round this problem and as a bonus one that will also make lscs easier to manufacture their answer is to get rid of the plastic sheet instead they spray a sheet of glass with a mixture of dyes combined with a substance called tris 8 hydroxyquinoline aluminium in combination the dyes and the glass act as the waveguide preventing light from escaping meanwhile the interaction between the different dye molecules and those of the tris 8 hydroxyquinoline aluminium allows a quantum mechanical phenomenon called f rster energy transfer to come into play this eliminates the reabsorption loss by ensuring that light is re emitted at a frequency which the dye molecules cannot then reabsorb
9264305 on top of this literally dr currie and dr mapel have come up with another trick placing a second sandwich of dye and glass over the first the upper layer of dye intercepts high energy light such as ultraviolet the lower one captures longer wavelengths that have passed unperturbed through the upper and also any lower energy light that has been re emitted within the top layer and somehow escaped the upshot is a device that even as a prototype converts ten times more of the incident light into electricity than a conventional solar cell and another contestant in the increasingly crowded race to replace old fashioned power generation with electricity from the sun
9264306 the dirty secret of clean energy is that while generating it is getting easier moving it to market is not the grid today according to experts is a system conceived 100 years ago to let utilities prop each other up reducing blackouts and sharing power in small regions it resembles a network of streets avenues and country roads
9264307 while the united states today gets barely 1 percent of its electricity from wind turbines many experts are starting to think that figure could hit 20 percent achieving that would require moving large amounts of power over long distances from the windy lightly populated plains in the middle of the country to the coasts where many people live builders are also contemplating immense solar power stations in the nations deserts that would pose the same transmission problems the grids limitations are putting a damper on such projects already the windiest sites have not been built because there is no way to move that electricity from there to the load centers gabriel alonso chief development officer of horizon wind energy said the basic problem is that many transmission lines and the connections between them are simply too small for the amount of power companies would like to squeeze through them the difficulty is most acute for long distance transmission but shows up at times even over distances of a few hundred miles

9264322 every time that anyones gotten the chance to redefine superman and there have been more than just a few of these chances since 1970 the first thing theyve thought to do was to de power him i didnt and dont see the point of depowering him its been my point of view that superman stories are not about power theyre about moral and ethical choices each one asks the question what does a good person do in a given situation if hes got all the power in the world
9264323 my desire for order and perfection was matched only by their dreams of violence and chaos the population was largely grateful and obedient but freedom fighters remained something of a problem i offered them utopia but they fought for their right to live in hell
9264324 america heals but america is not the world stronger in number the league begins to confront anarchy on a global scale as on their home territory supermans army begins to meet with success more infrequently social government was never supermans arena is it possible that the constant pressures thrust upon him as an emerging world leader could bend even a man of steel to the breaking point
9264325 time to put our hands up daddy lets go isa will help
9264326 i tried to send a text to most of you yesterday we lost the pregnancy it is an interesting dichotomy of events to experience the joy and excitement that comes with pregnancy and the sorrow of the loss of a child in the few weeks we wondered and few days we knew of the pregnancy we grew to love and care for our baby however the other shoe drops and we are saddened at the thought of what might have been a precious little girl and or an adventurous little boy needless to say we know god is at work in us refining us and challenging us to trust in him more over the past few days i continually find myself pondering the lords will and how in the midst of situations such as this we can often villainize despise or just avoid the lords will gods will is sovereign god is faithful and god is good i am not the victim of supernatural cruelty nor have i been ignored by immortal indifference he loves me and i cannot consider him an adversary i am realizing dependence on god in both good and bad times i will seek and know his purpose his plan the map and route of the trip he is taking with me he has charted the territory and he knows the land i will trust him thanks for your prayers
9264327 gods will is sovereign god is faithful and god is good

9264333 well i am trying to sick to a budget everything back home is double for me
9264334 oh thats right your accent should have given it away i understand then everything is a bit more for you

9264336 you just look so familiar have you been to the uk before
9264337 oh you look so familiar have i seen you on tv before
9264338 and may i just say quickly that i have been here for five days and it has not rained once i think the whole weather thing is a myth to keep people away

9264344 thorns so easily creep into my life daddy they so easily spring up nearly overnight their ability to do so is a testimony to my lack of addressing the root struggles of my heart could they appear if their roots werent buried beneath the surface of the soil it seems that i can manage the thorns sticking out above the surface of the ground but all the while the lower reaches of the plant are still active how else could i succumb to a barrage of sinful actions fully contradictory to the spirit within me

9264346 mijn basisstraf was zeven jaar werkkamp volgens paragraaf tien en geloof me ieder die minder dan acht jaar kreeg had niets gedan de beschuldigingen berustten nergens op maar dan was er nog paragraaf elf die betrekking heeft op groeps activiteit omdat we een groep waren werden we allemaal voor eeuwig verbannen verspreid over verschillende plaatsen om te zorgen dat we niet meer op de oude plaats bij elkaar konden komen ja wij waren een bende studenten jongens en meisjes in ons eerste jaar en soms praatten we over h m ach weet je er waren bepaalde dingen waar we ontevreden over waren we waren om zo te zeggen niet verrukt over alles in mei voor de examens rekenden ze ons allemaal in ook de meisjes

9264363 things previously outside the market once thought to be impossible to commodify are becoming routinely privatised

9264869 how to rent vacation properties by owner 2nd edition the complete guide to buy manage furnish rent maintain and advertise your vacation rental investment
9264870 renting out your vacation home allows you to have your cake and eat it too and the good news is its easy to do it yourself not to mention surprisingly lucrative
9264871 life rarely turns out to look like we thought it was going to look
9264872 thats okay some of the happiest most successful people ive met during my years working in this field never dreamed they would rent out their vacation home and yet once they tried it they love doing it it pays to be flexible and keep your options open
9264873 traditionally many retirees would sell the home they lived in for forty years downsize to a smaller house or apartment and split their time between that home and their vacation place in say florida
9264874 but there are drawbacks to doing that you lose your neighbors youre no longer close to your familiar grocery store and so forth and you dont get to pass the homestead down to your kids rent out your vacation home and you can have the best of both worlds you can afford both places its the perfect balanced solution
9264875 when people decide to postpone retirement they may also postpone moving to their retirement home
9264876 even if they do retire and then rejoin the workforce either full time or part time they may not want to live in the city they associate with retirement its a psychological thing and so in these cases its better to keep the vacation home a vacation home renting it out allows them to do that
9264877 if you have a mortgage on your second home renting it out only seventeen weeks will cover your mortgage payments for an entire year
9264878 if its paid for free and clear only five off week rentals will cover costs like bills for your phone power cable and association dues all the rest is profit when you consider that in some markets you can earn as much as 30k 40k in rental revenue per year from your vacation home youre looking at a nice raise for yourself
9264879 heres another good reason for seniors to rent by owner they typically have time to handle the details
9264880 not that theres a huge amount of work involved but it is easier to respond to renter inquiries do bookkeeping orchestrate routine maintenance details and so forth when you arent tied down to small children and or a demanding career plus vacation rental homeowners often meet interesting people and form friendships with them and retirees tend to have more time to nurture these relationships
9264881 who knows becoming a vacation rental property owner may become your encore career
9264882 buying and renting out vacation homes is addictive ive done this for years and i cant imagine ever not doing it its more than a way to make money its a richly rewarding way of life at any age
9264883 hmm is it as really as bad as they say it is
9264884 this little voice in conservatives is particularly loud and it is tied to a religious fear that equates voting for a pro choice candidate with sin
9264885 if you cannot love your brother whom you can see how can you love god whom you cannot see
9264886 they find a lot they look at the design they go through many months of what theyre buying without looking at the contractors proposed business terms
9264887 then the contractor pulls out the contract and says sign here by then the consumer has lost their leverage theyre so invested in the process
9264888 theres a natural tension for the homeowner to wonder if the contractor will cheapen the project in ways they dont see because his profit is being eroded
9264889 i dont really know what it will cost is a scary thing
9264890 if their scores are not optimal customers are feeling that in the wallet a little bit
9264891 yes we do look at the escalation and cost clauses
9264892 the only solution is to ask the customer to come up with more cash or refinance the construction loan when the project is done or you make a separate second mortgage or lien of credit to cover the extra cost
9264893 you wouldnt want to build something thats too customized or a home thats twice the size of others in the neighborhood
9264894 with the market as it is you wont get any of that value back

9264904 excellent and one of the better hymn albums youll find millard sounds great as usual bannisters production is typically flawless and the recording is teeming with great musicianship i just hope it s not the last because there are too many beloved church standards and too many creative ways to perform them for millard to wrap up a series with so much potential or for that matter to repeat himself musically from one hymned to another
9264905 shuffling through 10 historic gems and one original tune hymned again is a dazzling departure from mercymes more pensive pop rock fare flinging the door wide open for interpretation hymned again brilliantly stylizes its classic catalog with western swing brassy big band finger pickin dixieland simple acoustic and waltzy blues and jazz hymned again is an unusual and oh so wonderful blend of melody music and history that is unfortunately rare in todays capitalistic musical commerce
9264906 the man is like a diamond with more facets than you could ever guess it seems that music runs so deeply into bart millards soul that well have to get several more installments of the hymned series before we can do more than just scratch the surface
9264907 the musical styles on this collection may not appeal to everyone but those who have a fondness for church classics or folk country or blues music will surely enjoy this album warning spontaneous swaying toe tapping or head bobbing likely to occur while being hymned again
9264908 millards vocal versatility shines though as theres not a single moment where you think he shouldnt be tackling a style be it blues bluegrass jazz or balladry hes just that good

9265013 the snake is your animal soul when you bring it into the hot air of your wanting energy warmed by that and by the prospect of power and wealth it does massive damage leave it in the snow mountains dont expect to oppose it with quietness and sweetness and wishing it takes moses to deal with such a beast to lead it back and make it lie down in the snow but there was no moses then hundreds of thousands died
9265014 the sufis say that approximately 97 percent of the human beings in any nation are controlled by the nafs every breath they take comes out of the nafs all their acquiring and spending amounts to worship of the nafs and their reason or rational element overwhelmed by the nafs is reduced to making up excuses for peoples improper and embarrassing behavior
9265015 a few of the people in any nation perhaps 2 percent are while possessed by the nafs also aware of it some of them try to appeal to the nafs of the other 97 these people politicians can get the masses to do what they want them to do that the nafs hates government would be a surprise to no one
9265016 our effort here is to put clearly the odds that our
9265017 despite their fantastic recent growth record investors need to be very cautious about emerging markets
9265018 the emerging market universe will split into the haves and have nots
9265019 i am absolutely delighted by this selection once again john mccain has shown that he is an independent thinker who paints in bold strokes sarah palin is a conservative reformer with executive experience who will bring a breath of fresh air to washington she will be an ideal running mate for john mccain and will make a major contribution to our countrys future
9265020 a slow easy ride is what i had in mind anyway
9265021 i havent been riding much lately and im feeling a little rusty hopefully since its labor day weekend a lot of people will be away and traffic around the city will be light
9265022 she has more executive experience than the three other candidates combined
9265023 do i have a good relationship with him oneill i dont think so if i have to say hello then i will say hello to him i dont have any problem i had a good relationship with martin oneill before this summer and i was surprised at what has been said i talked with him in april and i havent spoken to him since then but i do not believe there will be any problem shaking hands we can do it my concern is to see my team playing well on the pitch and if the other things can be good then thats good but if not i will stay concentrated on my team i dont know what the reaction will be from the villa fans but we were correct in what we did with the transfer
9265024 its a win win james milner has got a fantastic move and we have got some more money in the pot should we choose to use it in this window or the next i did want to keep james but there comes a point when a deal is right to do im convinced that despite the fact that it wont look a positive move to our fans at the moment i think what will happen over the next two or three days will be positive for the future of this club
9265025 the threat to premier league dominance may not come from la liga or serie a after all but an entirely unexpected quarter
9265026 wenger wants it all he wants beautiful football and sooner rather than later he would like to win
9265027 russian technique has always been impressive if the capacity to sign the best players and the best managers to coach them is now added to that package we could be witnessing the dawn of a new force in the european game the threat to premier league dominance may not come from la liga or serie a after all but an entirely unexpected quarter
9265028 always looking for the quick pass scholes partnered the busy anderson in central midfield with darren fletcher and the left sided nani trying to provide the width tevez again terrific buzzed around in support of the front running wayne rooney whose uncertain movement against the excellent russians gave capello food for thought at right back gary neville looked far short of sharpness for super cup action let alone england
9265029 united should have plenty in reserve to come through a relatively moderate opening assignment in their defence of the trophy but scholess indiscretion was fitting for an evening when too many of fergusons players seemed distracted or to care little about the possibility of adding another trophy to the club collection carlos tevez was the exception playing indefatigably yet this is a strange time for rooney who had another peripheral game moreover nani flickered only sporadically and not for the first time it is easy to understand why ferguson is so keen to bring in dimitar berbatov
9265030 uniteds willingness to allow saha to leave for no initial fee suggests a deal with berbatov is imminent the frenchman a 12 8m buy from fulham in january 2004 still had two years left to run on his 65 000 a week contract his departure combined with the defender mika l silvestres exit for arsenal last week has taken over 100 000 off uniteds weekly wage bill but left united short of strikers before mondays transfer deadline
9265031 new evidence suggests that bayern are keen on the player and could swoop in and use spurs hostility towards last seasons champions league winners to take him from under their noses berbatov is reportedly on a list of players drawn up by the german champions who they are interested bayern are also looking for a defensive midfielder with anatoly tymoschuk 29 currently with uefa cup winners zenit st petersburg apparently a strong contender
9265032 if it was me i wouldnt do it in the first place i would play it doesnt give out a great message but it makes the boys work twice as hard for each other if i was in the same situation i would be working for the club as hard as i could until told otherwise ill always give 100 per cent wherever i am if i didnt want to be somewhere id still give my all every training session every game all the time
9265033 its important that we trust the club weve already spent a lot of money on people like david bentley and luka modric and i have confidence that the club wont be standing still ok to see someone like robbie leave is tough he was a great player for us hes a great lad well miss him and we wish him well berba is another brilliant player although for now he is still a spurs player but no player is irreplaceable and maybe it can be darren bents season as well i cant give darren enough credit for his attitude even last season when he was sat on the bench he was patient he never moaned and he trained hard every single day he was on the bench in the carling cup final but when that whistle went he was out on the pitch celebrating with everybody else
9265034 real value robinho at 32 million but chelseas offer falls about 5 million below that real though had wanted to secure a replacement for the forward before allowing him to leave but failed to capture david villa of valencia or santi cazorla of villarreal without a big name signing this summer after his pursuit of cristiano ronaldo fell flat calder n would suffer criticism from real fans if he allows robinho to leave especially after bernd schuster the real coach had expressed a desire to hold on to him
9265035 jo tal ben haim and vincent kompany may lack the wow factor of those long ago world footballers of the year but as men for the longer term they are far more valuable with martin petrov and wright phillips city will boast perhaps the most potent wing attack in the premier league the fact that the arrival of full back pablo zabaleta from espanyol will take hughes spending to about 50 million should ease those worries although vedran corluka is still likely to leave for tottenham and nery castillo for real betis
9265036 the question now facing every arsenal fan and current and putative directors and investors is whether wengers version of footballs holy grail is something to be prized and suffered or tossed out as so much fancy thinking placed in the path of such financial behemoths as chelsea and manchester united wenger says that the ambition to win is fundamental but it is also important how you do it how you build an understanding of how you secure the future and shape that most precious of assets a real identity wenger wants it all he wants beautiful football and sooner rather than later he would like to win yes it is a dream but sometimes a dream comes true and doesnt that make the life of a true fan ultimately worthwhile
9265037 keegan will offer newcastle supporters faith another test by placing joey barton on the bench at arsenal for this evenings televised game it is bartons first appearance in club colours since his release from prison for assault his football association hearing is next friday bartons presence is due to an injury crisis that has affected an already small squad to the point where keegan said he has 14 fit first teamers a 17 year old called nile ranger may start today recently released from southamptons academy he signed as a free agent a few weeks ago and slipped virtually unnoticed on to newcastles bench at coventry city on tuesday night
9265038 in his effort to encourage clean sport platini plans to introduce two supplementary referees patrolling the touchline looking for simulation i dived once he revealed it was in a game for nancy against nantes in 1975 now i can admit it the referee didnt see it i was happy to do it on that occasion if we could win the match because i cheated everyone was happy what the referee cant see the supplementary referees can see we wont have diving around it will also mean less running for the central referees who can referee until they are 50 we will test it at the uefa youth championships platinis ideas are beginning to be turned into reality
9265039 i like reading autobiographies ive just finished reading martin johnsons book and lawrence dallaglios ive got respect for people like that the biggest thing that stands out was their passion to play for their country and their conduct in the rugby world cup final against australia a bad decision was given against england and australia kicked a penalty to draw level johnson didnt have a go at the referee he just accepted it it must have been difficult that stood out thats respect
9265040 in wayne rooney and michael owen we have two of the greatest strikers in the world put them together and we could we should have one of the most lethal partnerships in the game ok i agree they havent exactly set the world alight yet but when two players are so gifted and so rich in natural talent then it only takes a few minor adjustments for the fireworks to start the ground rule here should be this owen must go no further than the halfway line and then rooney must go no further than 12 yards deeper than this the logic is simple if england counter attack rooney is close enough to owen to be able to break out and give him support and if england are defending once rooney has stopped at this 12 yard point there are still eight more players left to cover the small area of the pitch that is left in front of our goal
9265041 desperate england aces smuggled chocolate bars into their rooms to fill the hole left by coach fabio capellos new super tough diet
9265042 capello will name his squad tomorrow for the opening world cup qualifying matches away to andorra a week today and croatia four days later and with hargreaves joining steven gerrard and michael carrick on the injured list his options will be severely limited frank lampard and gareth barry who failed to impress as a central midfield partnership in the recent drawn friendly with the czech republic at wembley appear certain to start both matches with jermaine jenas their only obvious understudy beyond that capello may have to call up a player such as tom huddlestone out of favour at tottenham hotspur scott parker mark noble nigel reo coker or even contemplate a recall for nicky butt who has not played for england since 2004
9265043 we wont know the lineup until the day before the game so im not sure if ill be starting or coming off the bench i just have to be ready to play i have the feeling that ive been given a reward in a way because the coach has liked what hes seen from me also we have a couple of injuries to our forwards giuseppe rossi and nihat again i dont know if im going to start on sunday i really would be shocked but im just really excited and cant wait to get on the field and to be a part of the whole thing

9265058 it takes longer to become a good tailor than a good doctor
9265059 lets interfere with everyones usability and experience because there are a couple of bad seeds out there
9265060 with climate change and globalisation the ageing of the population is one of the major challenges europe must face
9265061 from 2015 onwards deaths would outnumber births and population growth due to natural increase would cease
9265062 positive net migration would be the only population growth factor however from 2035 this positive net migration would no longer counterbalance the negative natural change
9265063 in the honest belief that he needed to protect his son
9265064 it is beyond question that by acting in the way that he
9265065 that is a consequence for which mr khan must be punished with a significant custodial sentence
9265066 what became obvious as the evidence unfolded however is that from time to time despite denials to the contrary both mr brown and his son ashley barker were involved in acts of racial aggression towards members of mr khans family
9265067 but the man who knows the relations of the forces of nature and actions sees how some forces of nature work upon other forces of nature and becomes not their slave
9265068 they scream they sing they fall down they take their clothes off they cross dress they vomit
9265069 it is only the british people not the germans or the french
9265070 these people are giving a bad name to their country
9265071 many arrests are due to behavior caused by excessive drinking
9265072 i think that in their country they are like prisoners and they want to feel free
9265073 its because of british culture no one can relax so they become inebriated to be the people they want to be
9265074 when things do go wrong they go wrong in quite a big way
9265075 what were trying to do here is reduce some of these avoidable accidents where they have so much to drink that they fall off balconies and are either killed or need huge operations
9265076 british tour operators present them with these packages that promise a wild holiday in malia
9265077 this predisposes them they are automatically put into a wild and lawless mind set that is beyond them
9265078 ive never seen anyone get stabbed the whole time ive been here
9265079 if theres a girl being sick in the streets you see people helping her out
9265080 we dont like you lot coming in and ruining the place
9265081 for 10 weeks this place is littered with kids being sick and unconscious in the streets
9265082 we have stressful jobs and we dont get much time off and we like to enjoy ourselves and have a good laugh and we love a bargain
9265083 every moving thing that lives shall be food for you and just as i gave you the green plants i give you everything only you shall not eat flesh with its life that is its blood
9265084 to the egyptians the heart was not only a vital organ of the body it
9265085 we must go all the way back to babylonian divination to find the liver
9265086 1 it is not as a matter of fact impossible that the words life and liver are ultimately connected as german leib and leber certainly are though there are breaks in the chain of etymological evidence for the hypothesis
9265087 the discovery of the epic and the first arrangement and translation of its material was due to the genius of george smith although attention had early been drawn by sir henry rawlinson to the probability that the accounts in genesis had a babylonian origin and that gilgamesh was a solar hero
9265088 as has already been noted the versions found in babylonia have much in
9265089 enkidu why are you cursing my harlot shamhat who fed you on food fit for gods
9265090 you shall not eat cursed is the ground because of you
9265091 opinion source is a great way to track influential op eds without having to scour through all the top newspapers or even those newspapers web sites i find it useful for getting a quick round up of what editorials are saying on any given day as a media professional im always on information overload so consolidation of smart content is key
9265092 i always appreciate the newsletters from opinionsource i look forward to keeping up with national and international news your network keeps the reader informed from china to the new york isles thank you
9265093 if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye live through the spirit to mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live
9265094 put to death therefore whatever belongs to your earthly nature sexual immorality impurity lust evil desires and greed which is idolatry
9265095 only flesh is a group of piercers and tattoo artists that formed a group dedicated to combining body modification flesh pulls brandings cuttings object suspension piercing flesh suspension and performance art to shock arouse and entertain
9265096 so women are often obliged to repress their sexuality in order for them to be taken seriously however of course we do all realise that this is bullshit take my friend jenna right intelligent credible forceful and persuasive intellectually capable basically but jesus sexy the womans on fire by looking only at her body my body roxys body whoevers body are we denying their intelligence no not necessarily the two are not mutually dependent
9265097 gold bars on the advice of an accountant uh no thats like the hugest red flag you could raise with fincen might as well don a t shirt that reads hi im laundering money and run victory laps around the local district attorneys office
9265098 nowhere do they address the sex workers who choose this profession nowhere do they talk about how the criminalization of sex work makes pimps more powerful and prevents sex workers from reporting crimes committed against them nowhere do they talk about the men and women who engage with sex workers and lead healthy normal lives
9265099 on a tuesday morning at 7 a m i set out to discover just how easy it would be for me to get my hands on some emergency contraception
9265100 eight million articles on how the sex industry will spike during the democratic and republican national conventions as based on the evidence from craigslist ads news media i tip my cap to you you actually made a graph of craigslist ads
9265101 i am desperate for you to understand this an american city in the year 2008 asked a jury of seven men and women to declare that a movie of adults having sex could be illegal
9265102 i know that im going to be thinking of acevedo when this years international day to end violence against sex workers comes around because the naked contempt for her death says so much about who our society considers disposable in the end shes not a tragedy just a one liner
9265103 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to the agenda of big oil
9265104 youre absolutely right on the cleansing thats needed in our party in the republican party
9265105 well i dont know governor palin i have not met her before i had a brief conversation with her after she was selected to congratulate her and wish her luck but not too much luck on the campaign trial and she seems to have a compelling life story
9265106 god couldnt she at least have turned it right side up
9265107 the rumor on the shop floor is that despite increased productivity and nearly a centurys worth of community ties this facility may soon be closed and production shipped overseas

9265109 do you have a vise grip theyre not going to get rid of vise grip
9265110 thats one of their growth businesses they love the tool business
9265111 one could ask if theyll continue to make vise grips in dewitt nebraska
9265112 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9265113 to have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9265114 should really make the app start to shine a bit more
9265115 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
9265116 in washington they call this the ownership society but what that really means is youre on your own
9265117 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes
9265118 talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
9265119 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
9265120 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war thats not the judgment we need
9265121 you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying iraq you cant truly stand up for georgia when youve strained our oldest alliances
9265122 to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
9265123 the whole obama narrative is built around the narrative that obama and campaign strategist david axelrod built and like all stories its not entirely true
9265124 his constituents the media and his political opponents to fully examine him
9265125 pattern of rarely volunteering information or documents even when relatively innocuous
9265126 as the president of the law review obama didnt write articles he edited and reviewed them
9265127 we have released documents that reflect every one of the final terms of the senators purchase of the home
9265128 i know hillary clinton and sarah palin is no hillary clinton
9265129 they wouldnt let me look at it or respond to it
9265130 fork method im not sure what this means but the fingertips have a single piece of leather that curves around the outside of each finger with leather sewn on the top and bottom to cap it see photo below
9265131 we hope to develop these techniques further and apply them to more volcanoes worldwide
9265132 potentially these techniques could extend our knowledge of volcanic recharge considerably as they can be applied to material erupted before volcanic monitoring was commonplace
9265133 we hope that what we find in the crystals in terms of timescales can be linked with phenomena such as earthquakes
9265134 if we can relate the timescales we measure to such events we may be able to say when we could expect a volcano to erupt
9265135 this is an exciting new method that will help us understand the timescales of fundamental volcanic processes driving eruptions
9265136 injuries from well intentioned use of cotton swabs to remove earwax are something i see almost every day in my practice despite the admonition on every box that clearly says
9265137 the best way to keep your ears clean is to leave them alone we all have a self cleaning mechanism like a little conveyor belt in our ear canals that can bring wax out every time you chew and swallow it helps to move that process along the best way to have it work is not to sabotage it by sticking items in your ear canal that may have a negative effect
9265138 if youre constantly sticking earphones in your ear youre going to interfere with the normal removal of wax
9265139 i dont think anyone knows the exact mechanism of how it goes awry
9265140 some of it is genetic different types of people have different types of earwax the genetics in certain people is such that there is a very dry or flaky earwax produced which is often more prone to accumulation some have a more sticky earwax
9265141 the cane toads cannot survive in much of southern australia because they would be too cold to move about and forage or spawn
9265142 we found that cane toads can barely hop once they get below about 15 degrees celsius
9265143 their range would also be constrained by the limited availability of water for their tadpoles in some parts of australia
9265144 these are perfect conditions for growing wine but you are unlikely to meet a toad at a winery
9265145 our study is particularly helpful in predicting where cane toads could live under climate change because we have identified a cause and effect way that climate limits the toads
9265146 in one way it is obvious why dry conditions are bad for frogs they lose too much water
9265147 but having wet skin also provides frogs with a thermal challenge because the evaporating water takes heat away from their bodies and often makes them colder than the air
9265148 the remarkable alignment of the electric vector with the rotational axis of the pulsar together with its similarity to the optical polarization angle suggests that both fluxes originate at the same site close to the neutron star the findings have clear implications on many aspects of high energy accelerators such as the crab
9265149 we figured out how to get the mother of all blood stem cells with the right culture conditions
9265150 there is real hope that in the future we can grow billions of blood cells at will to treat blood related disorders and just as critically if not more so weve got ace as a new old marker to guide our work
9265151 but were very pleasantly surprised to discover it as a beacon for finding the earliest blood stem cells known as well as new ways to find and manipulate this marker to make them grow
9265152 we can make lots and lots of blood cells from human stem cells for transfusions regenerate new vascular trees for heart diseases as well as create test tube factories for making transplantable blood cells that treat diseases we are very far from treatment

9265191 to take a practical political stand is one thing and to analyze political structures and party positions is another the words one uses in a political meeting are not means of scientific analysis but means of canvassing votes and winning over others they are not plowshares to loosen the soil of contemplative thought they are swords against the enemies such words are weapons it would be an outrage however to use words in this fashion in a lecture or in the classroom
9265192 i am ready to prove from the works of our historians that whenever the man of science introduces his personal value judgment a full understanding of the facts

9265271 the rate of grade 3 toxicity from 3dcrt with 78 gy in 2 0 gy fractions remains better than expected compared to historical controls however low grade late toxicity is significantly higher in dose level v than dose level iii these differences may be dose and or volume related
9265272 tolerance to three dimensional conformal radiotherapy with 74 gy in 2 gy fractions remains better than expected compared with historical controls the magnitude of any effect from fraction size requires additional follow up
9265273 this multicenter controlled phase iii trial failed to confirm the efficacy of betaseron in patients receiving definitive radiotherapy for locally advanced nonmetastatic non small cell lung cancer the use of beta interferon led to greater rates of both acute and late treatment related toxicity

9265281 results of this trial regarding psa response and clinical disappearance of disease are similar to historical controls and do not warrant further investigation of etanidazole as was done in this trial
9265282 patients with unresectable alpha fetoprotein positive hepatocellular carcinoma experienced improved survival and decreased toxicity when managed with post induction cycles of intra arterial cisplatin as compared with intravenous doxorubicin and 5 fu intravenous 131i polyclonal antiferritin did not improve survival when added to either post induction regimen but dramatically increased hematologic toxicities
9265283 the maximum tolerated dose of fractionated 2 50 gy hbi was found to be 17 5 gy the major dose limiting toxicity was hematological thromboleukopenia there was not a significant dose response effect on occult disease appearance of new disease or in the requirement for additional treatment although certain trends were noted for the higher doses when only patients completing assigned hbi from rtog 82 06 and 88 22 were compared there was no difference in the time to new disease or additional treatment in the treated field based on the investigative parameters of this study single high dose hbi was as effective as fractionated hbi
9265284 in patients with gleason score 2 6 carcinoma of the prostate a short course of androgen ablation administered before and during radiotherapy has been associated with a highly significant improvement in local control reduction in disease progression and overall survival
9265285 in a population of patients with unfavorable prognosis carcinoma of the prostate androgen suppression applied as an adjuvant after definitive rt was associated not only with a reduction in disease progression but in a statistically significant improvement in absolute survival the improvement in survival appeared preferentially in patients with a gleason score of 7 10

9265289 does race influence survival for esophageal cancer patients treated on the radiation and chemotherapy arm of rtog 85 01
9265290 the study design could not credibly establish a safe dose for hepatic irradiation however it did succeed in determining that 33 gy in fractions of 1 5 gy is unsafe carrying a substantial risk of delayed radiation injury the absence of apparent late liver injury at the 27 gy and 30 gy dose levels suggests that a prior clinical trial of adjuvant hepatic irradiation in patients with resected colon cancer may have employed an insufficient radiation dose 21 gy to fully test the question
9265291 intravenous 131 i polyclonal antiferritin did not improve survival when added to either post induction regimen but dramatically increased hematologic toxicities
9265292 the results of the study indicate comparable efficacy using tumor clearance as an end point of des and megestrol although des appears more effective in suppressing testosterone it is also associated with a higher incidence of drug related toxicity
9265293 fraction size in external beam radiation therapy in the treatment of melanoma
9265294 these studies have demonstrated the toxicity and therapeutic activity of 131i antiferritin and the emerging role of radiolabelled antibody in cancer therapy
9265295 this clinical trial demonstrates that hbi has the potential to be used to treat systemic and occult metastases particularly if both halves of the body can be treated
9265296 present results suggest that further clinical studies with isotopic immunoglobulin are indicated
9265297 hbi achieves pain relief sooner and with less evidence of pain recurrence in the irradiated area than conventionally treated patients the most effective and safest of the hbi doses tested were 600 rad for the upper hbi and 800 rad for the lower or mid hbi
9265298 the results of the study revealed no statistically significant benefit of elective pelvic irradiation
9265299 periaortic irradiation was not associated with a significantly increased incidence of bowel injuries manifested by diarrhea no correlation between the total dose to the regional lymphatics ranging from 4400 to 5100 cgy and the incidence of bowel and bladder injuries could be established doses to the prostate in excess of 7000 cgy have not resulted in a significantly increased incidence of bladder injuries but have been associated with a significant increase in the incidence of bowel injuries manifested by diarrhea the techniques of pelvic irradiation did not seem to significantly influence the incidence of bowel or bladder complications the technique of delivery of the prostatic boost did seem to influence the incidence of bowel injuries this refers to the lateral boost technique and the perineal boost technique which have been associated with a higher incidence of diarrhea

9265327 there is a movement in mexico to recognize the contributions of migrants to this country and give them a voice
9265328 anyone who participates in that process of transmitting information from the united states anyone is at this point playing a very important role
9265329 i still believe there is opportunity in this area but there is also a lot more for the mexican immigrant to deal with
9265330 we target our efforts in that area in hopes that a visible police presence in that area would be a deterrent to criminals
9265331 persons who are driving with an appropriate drivers license and obeying the law certainly do not have any reason to be fearful of any interaction with the police

9265340 murphy brown is doing better than i am at least she knows she still has a job next year
9265341 ive heard many comments that latino people need to volunteer
9265342 we want to volunteer the offer has been out there for a long time i think the group would benefit from having latino representation
9265343 we were not aware of the revitalization of the group now that we know what its all about and that the mayor is hoping to add new members we believe that we should be active formal members of this alliance
9265344 it is troublesome that a community that is 60 percent hispanic has no latino sitting on a governing body if you dont like whats happening then run for office we should be part of the police department part of the fire department its up to us to make that happen
9265345 cine joven is open to anyone age 14 to 19 and within the program
9265346 we have the telenovela class which were doing for the first time this summer we have the regular summer camps that start at the beginning of june and august and then during the school year we have classes that meet once a week for 10 weeks where the kids make a five minute short which is then screened at the asfs loud amp clear film festival in the following march
9265347 weve been building the cine joven program for four years now and its still very much in development were still learning were trying to serve not just the hispanic community but also the spanish speaking community as a whole and also those people who are connected to that culture in essence cine joven is trying to give a voice to young people without having them tell the usual immigrant crossing the border narrative of course thats a pertinent theme but were really just experimenting and trying to discover what other genres kids will tap into
9265348 obviously there is a debate about race and immigration going on throughout the country as well as here in austin
9265349 the first question most parents had was is this a remedial course
9265350 that if anything this is an advanced course not in spite of but because it is bilingual the kids are creating projects using two different languages parents can also have a feeling of is this going to serve the kids at all in the future because we dont want to get their hopes up and we dont want to waste their time and you know to paraphrase from one of the reality shows popular on tv right now its really hard to be creative if you dont have the means to do it with a lot of these kids its very hard to even find the time to be creative because they go to school and then they go to work and thats it theres not time for dilly dallying or creative endeavors its survival its work
9265351 thats another big part of our outreach program at asf and cine joven
9265352 we want them to have access to the tools of filmmaking and media production and weve got those tools right here
9265353 ultimately weve found that the parents usually get on board once they realize that their kids are going to be learning not only filmmaking but also life building skills and skills that will help them academically in the future in the past some parents have arrived with the idea that cine joven was just another extracurricular activity and so they werent all that interested in enrolling their kids but once we get the parents in here and they actually see the technical aspects of the program obviously as part of the asf were apple certified and we have access to all the cameras computers and editing software we need and how multidisciplinary the program is be it via career building or creating a portfolio that these kids can use when they apply to college or just by learning basic creative skills then the parents really get behind it you know we can actually get away with having these kids write a lot if we tell them its a film or telenovela script and they love it
9265354 getting these kids stories out of their hearts and onto paper
9265355 was actually looking for a way to get out of work but then i really got into the class and now im thinking i might make a career out of it you know
9265356 i like scorsese hes italian american which is kind of like being mexican american
9265357 yes im interested in depicting my familys struggle my parents immigrated to austin from mexico city in the eighties do you know the director alejandro gonz lez i rritu i enjoy his work because it shows the realism and background of actually living in mexico hispanic culture is such a vast and interesting culture that to have it represented in the arts and in film by the standard images of gangs and criminals is just insulting the 2007 larry the cable guy film delta farce is a good example of just how much of an insult it can be i think we can do better than that i know the new generation of filmmakers will do better than that
9265358 especially the dynasty warriors series where you could create your own characters
9265359 later on as i got more and more into gaming
9265360 i thought wow i could make a movie out of this and the only way i could do that was through cine joven now i want to learn how to act i know i can do this but i always say it takes time to fulfill dreams
9265361 create a backstory for your character what do they do when theyre not doing whats in the script who do they hang out with what sets them apart from all the other characters
9265362 about what separates them from the other people that live in austin and whats common to mexican areas of town
9265363 that idea of class and social boundaries is a big part of what were doing with the telenovela its going to be kind of like the sandlot where you have that happy kind of feel of what its like to be just a kid with a normal life in a normal neighborhood with kids doing all the things kids do kind of like the rich privileged little leaguers versus the scruffy sandlot heroes but in our case theyre all hispanic and theyre not playing baseball
9265364 fully 50 percent latino and 50 percent everybody else and thats because so many people who used to live in austin just cant afford it anymore
9265365 from preproduction through production to postproduction and giving them the basic skill sets that they need to get out there and make a film
9265366 i try to teach them as much as possible from a technical standpoint and its tough because theyre all over the place they want to get out there and do it already
9265367 now they have a pretty clear idea of how filmmaking is done so that when theyre writing they can think ahead to what sort of camera angles they might want what kind of editing choices they might need to consider all that theyre able to visualize ahead of time what might or might not work
9265368 they kind of come in with the idea that theyre just going to take a video camera and go shoot something
9265369 thats important and exciting to me too as their teacher but its even more important when you stop to consider that in our global economy nowadays it doesnt matter anymore if you know word and spreadsheets
9265370 when you learn filmmaking and when youre involved in filmmaking youre also learning all these other things you learn how to manage your time efficiently you learn how to organize you learn how to plan you learn leadership skills communication skills so many things and when you get out into the real world youre going to need that to be successful

9265396 the disappointing thing was the way we started the game the first 25 minutes was so unlike us as we made it so easy for hearts and conceded a soft goal
9265397 but after that i thought we came right back into the game
9265398 we played three up front but the three did not do enough and ive told them that in the dressing room
9265399 richard offiong had a chance late on and unfortunately he slipped and nicked his hamstring
9265400 we were a bit naive at times and hearts probably shaded the game but if you ask me who were the better football team then i would say us
9265401 it is not easy playing against a team who have just come up from the first division
9265402 i must compliment hamilton as they are a young team with good spirit but we had more of the game and played good football
9265403 our fans must understand that we have a very young squad without experience but it was a fantastic afternoon for us
9265404 layrea kingston was a big personality in the game and andrew driver sometimes does not realise how much talent he has
9265405 we should have won the game we had three or four really good chances and just one mistake at the end of the first half has punished us
9265406 i thought garry brady was the best player on the park a real assured performance against quality opposition
9265407 at half time we are scratching our heads and wondering how we have gone in one down with the dominance that we had
9265408 i think the manner which were playing is exciting weve just got to cut out individual mistakes and keep playing with the belief and confidence we have been showing
9265409 i thought we started very well and were knocking it about but then we started to get sloppy
9265410 it was a mistake by them and weve got a break at a very important time
9265411 second half we had so many chances to put it bed and we didnt guss team worked their socks off and garry brady did really well for them in midfield
9265412 but we got the result and its another clean sheet away from home thats us got seven points from four games now in difficult matches

9265418 im in the most contested senate race in the state of florida
9265419 to get people excited you need a mix of good candidates
9265420 its a strategy and it did not happen by chance
9265421 stronger parties that are better organized can better recruit candidates because they know they have a better chance of winning
9265422 our concentration is voter turnout which is something we do well and they do not
9265423 at the end of the day its about who gets the most votes
9265424 florida at large is fiscally conservative and socially moderate and depending on the issue one of those sides takes more prominence
9265425 people arent going to donate unless they think you have a good chance of winning
9265426 when you have a great bunch of candidates that can only help voter turnout
9265427 now our voters have plenty of reasons to come out to the polls and vote the entire ballot
9265428 sarasota is gaining national attention because if sarasota goes obama the state goes obama and then the country goes obama
9265429 we get a lot of questions like why is that one on top of the other one
9265430 we do talk a lot about the birds and the bees
9265431 it would be like the brakes on a subway except with more rapidly fluctuating amplitude

9265435 the best thing the delegates could do to ensure that the party continues to grow is to focus on non divisive issues
9265436 social conservatives are and will be highly skeptical of charlie crist
9265437 charlie crist is first and foremost a pragmatist and that means that the issues he pushes or advocate will change depending on what the circumstances are
9265438 i do think theres a risk to crist being seen as trying to appease the extreme wing of his party
9265439 people like the live and let live guy theyre not really fond of someone who will go whichever way he thinks the political wind is blowing
9265440 the party platform across the board is a conservative document
9265441 it embodies social conservative views social conservatives are the heartbeat of the party
9265442 the republican party as a whole not only in the state but nationally has to decide if its going to be exclusive or inclusive
9265443 it will play out in this election if those who differ from the far far right conservative planks of the platform are made to feel as if they are unloved and unwanted i think theyll stay home
9265444 illustrates that he understands or at least the people around him understand that social conservatives are an important part of his base and its time to start sending the message that they matter
9265445 but im not at all convinced that the next three picks will be as strong as charles canady
9265446 an attempt to shore up his base and pander to the extreme right
9265447 i dont think people of any political persuasion like to feel as though theyre being told what they want to hear
9265448 it may be a situation that today social conservatives may not be at the head table of the republican party but were still in the same room
9265449 anybody who is a good thinking logical person knows if were going to win anything weve got to do that
9265450 she had a kind of driven quality and was not afraid of change or embracing something new
9265451 she would tell us about her joy of being on the sea and having her cameras with her

9265458 they tend to come and spend time at a library where there are friendly people some comfortable seating
9265459 maybe some aspect of the collection is important to them but its mainly just their basic need for information
9265460 this is a renegade trend in libraries to throw out dewey and organize the collection in the way that people might logically find things
9265461 i dont want to say i was depressed but for the first couple of weeks i just kind of sat there saying holy crap
9265462 unemployment rates are higher than the entire time i have been in this business 13 years
9265463 were not expecting it to go that high at this point
9265464 we are in for a couple of months of these bad job market reports for florida
9265465 this is going to weigh down on the economy probably until the mid part of 2009
9265466 the employer looks at the applicant and the applicant may decide this is not the kind of work environment i want
9265467 seasoned professionals are out in the market and some of them are applying for entry level jobs to get their foot back in if theyve been laid off
9265468 so that is adding to the competition for our new job seekers
9265469 someone from the real estate market who loves sales coming back for a finance degree
9265470 if you look at the jobs on our web site they are not low end jobs
9265471 engineering technician executive secretary medical administrator bookkeeper field inspector auditing clerk these are good jobs

9265554 let the day perish wherein i was spawned and the night in which it was said a seed oyster has appeared why is light given to him that is in misery and life to the bitter in soul why do i live my days in doubt and darkness o that one would hear me and tell me openly of the glories above behold my desire is that the almighty would answer me
9265555 all right all right but i have to make it short its friday afternoon
9265556 and its not all slapdash either ive got creatures so graceful they almost break your heart when it comes to exquisite moves my favorite maybe is girls knees lovely some people think thats a funny thing to get excited about but in my line of work theres no substitute for enthusiasm
9265557 seriously if you take the knee thing and really go all the way with it you get my absolute favorite for loveliness a prima ballerina talk about moves its like ernie digregorio marcel marceau and squirrel nutkin all rolled together but as a girl which makes it that much better terrific
9265558 listen though its almost sundown and i have to set a good example as i said your basic problem is your point of view there really are all these great moves but you unfortunately dont know from motion if your going into business as the worlds first philosophical oyster its o k by me but just so you shouldnt get it all wrong ill give you one piece of advice think very carefully remember that all this stuff really is but it cant possibly be the way you think or to turn it around the way you think about things will never be exactly the same as the way they are but enough i really have to run mazel tov

9265564 a student is not above his teacher but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher
9265565 follow my example as i follow the example of christ

9265569 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9265570 in this very competitive election for them to go pick somebody who is under a cloud of suspicion who is under investigation for abuse of power it just sounds like a pretty slow start to me we need a vice president who can step in if god forbid something happened to john mccain i dont think shes someone who is ready for that 3 a m phone call
9265571 a mixed set of emotions kind of an odd sense of alaska nationalism or pride this is like watching a moon landing or something its just something you dont expect to see very often its wonderful it was an emotional thing to see the governor walk out with her family and i say wow i work for her
9265572 she brings her voice of new energy and change and she knows alaska
9265573 this shocking choice says more about mccains desperation than it does about palins qualifications

9265582 being governor of a small state for less than two years is not consistent with the normal criteria for determining whos of presidential caliber
9265583 i think she is the most inexperienced person on a major party ticket in modern history
9265584 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it

9265795 i suspect that the radio advert which features an impassioned american accented voice exhorting us to come for the purpose of burning plastic jesus es would highly amuse some and highly annoy others whether they knew what he was talking about or not personally i am all for re instating the image of jesus to the phenomenal status he deserves both immanent and transcendent but i cant help wishing that there had been a little more aussie cultural contextualisation homework done for the promotional campaign
9265796 pure spiritual intellectual love shot form their faces like barbed lightning it was so unlike the love we experience that its expression could easily be mistaken for ferocity
9265797 no i did not its three in the morning and it is pouring out

9265808 oklahoma city is home for me and my family and my heart is here being a blazer means the world to me and is something i will never take for granted having said that i have huge expectations for myself this year i feel i have another level as a player that i can get to everything i am capable of has to be brought to the table every night to have a positive impact on this hockey club i want to prove myself over and over everyday prove myself as leader a leader is under the microscope and his actions have to motivate and affect others in a positive way a challenge that i welcome
9265809 there has been a lot of change happen over the course of the summer and it has been like a good long look in the mirror a chance to refocus with change comes a sense of suspense and anticipation which ultimately leads to a feeling of excitement i cant remember the last time i have been so excited in regards to an upcoming season oklahoma city has the greatest fans in the central hockey league and all of pro hockey as far as im concerned and they deserve something special i will kill myself to give it to them its time to win
9265810 the good thing about the schedule is that we got to keep our saturday night games
9265811 the pattern for the basketball team was to play games on wednesday friday and sunday night while we miss out on a few friday nights we can capitalize on the saturday night games with the help of gary desjardins the staff at smg and the cooperation of the chl we were able to pick up two friday dates that the nba team was not awarded on their schedule

9265819 this is the second cornerstone of foundation of our team
9265820 we feel he can be a first line center on our team in the league he is not a flashy type of player he is a hard worker who is good on draws and shows up on the scoresheet nearly every night
9265821 i see this nation differently than i did 10 months ago
9265822 that this travesty was committed by the democratic party has forever changed my approach to politics
9265823 this is not the usual reaction to an election loss
9265824 i know that is the way it is being spun but its not prototypical anyone who doesnt take time to analyze it will do so at their own peril
9265825 that the winter of discontent in politics had come for women
9265826 the american womans movement and her interest in great moral and social questions is splintered into a hundred fragments under as many warring leaders
9265827 the feminist movement is dying of partial victory and inanition
9265828 where for years there had been purpose consecrated to an immortal principle
9265829 keeping the light on is probably the best contribution that we can make where there is now stygian darkness
9265830 exactly where men political leaders wanted them bound gagged divided and delivered to the republican and democratic parties
9265831 the feminist crash of the 20s came as a painful shock so painful that it took history several decades to face up to it
9265832 i am sorry for you young women who have to carry on the work in the next 10 years for suffrage was a symbol and you have lost your symbol

9265863 trillions for military technology how the pentagon innovates and why it costs so much

9265867 in my 30 year history in the drug enforcement administration and related agencies the major targets of my investigations almost invariably turned out to be working for the cia

9265923 well what about foreign policy she doesnt have any foreign policy
9265924 who does this woman represent in alaska but a handfull of rednecks and several thousand moose
9265925 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven moore said with a chuckle in a televised interview
9265926 that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river moore said in an interview with msmbcs keith olbermann on
9265927 certainly i hope nobody gets hurtt i hope everybodys taking cover
9265928 went through some things im not sure i could go through
9265929 the friday interviewing was conducted in an unusual political environment the first conducted fully after obamas well regarded acceptance speech gallup notes
9265930 a lot of people in the activist community are really on pins and needles about whos next
9265931 our organization will continue we will be on the streets
9265932 take the evacuation seriously even if you have ridden out the storm before
9265933 every indication has the storm bearing down on the louisiana coast and it is potentially a very powerful storm
9265934 do not ride it out ride it out of town
9265935 i have town hall meetings all over the country all of the time and i know how people are hurting
9265936 i dont think americans are too concerned that my father in law was able to achieve the great american success story they want to stay in their own homes
9265937 first of all i think a lot of them know i spent 51 2 years in a lot of anxiety and pain
9265938 and i didnt have a kitchen table and i didnt have a chair
9265939 i was just talking to some people in ohio where they continue to lose jobs they continue to lose their homes
9265940 ive got to give them a specific and strong plan of action
9265941 in difficult times weve had a bush administration and voters want change
9265942 ive got to make a convincing case that i represent the right kind of change based on my record and outlining a strong agenda
9265943 sure i do sure i do and its a documented fact that it was the dnc that went after me first and the 527s political groups and the unions
9265944 but the fact is people should have a sense of humor
9265945 let me say sen obama made a choice about iraq and he chose to say the surge wouldnt work he said it would fail he got the nomination in large degree by going to the far left of his party on iraq
9265946 i chose the path which was least popular im not questioning his patriotism im questioning his judgment and i will continue to question his judgment and his qualifications to lead
9265947 what i hear from everybody i know is that i dont talk about it enough
9265948 people keep saying to me talk about it more we need to hear your personal story how you made a choice for your country when you refused to come home early i think that sen obama has a great story to tell and certainly i dont begrudge him telling it
9265949 theyre not going to speak theyre not going to do any politicking or campaigning theyre just part of our family and its appropriate for our family be there
9265950 both of them are on duty so theyll be leaving right after the convention is over back to their duties
9265951 sure im nervous particularly given the fact that sen obama is probably the greatest speaker of our time
9265952 when you found out your baby would be born with down syndrome did you consider killing it before or after the due date
9265953 rush just now imagining a series of questions that obama can ask palin if they ever meet
9265954 a staffer with separate responsibilities made a poor recommendation that was not heeded the individual has been spoken to and this will not occur again
9265955 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9265956 palin has more executive level decision making and governing experience in two years than obama and biden do combined
9265957 she saw something that she thought was wrong and she wanted to see it righted
9265958 democrats rejected a woman obama could have picked one but he bypassed hillary he didnt even vet her he disrespected hillary clinton big time look what has happened for all the talk of a new kind of politics he chose biden
9265959 he told her she would be a terrific candidate and that he looked forward to seeing her on the campaign trail
9265960 he also wished her good luck but not too much luck
9265961 its all about how much good work is out there and who wants it enough to pay the highest price for the best of it
9265962 be sure to do a 10 minute stretch before hand maybe run a couple laps around the block and we advise you attend an anger management course before hand be sure to set up a few counceling sessions immediatley afterward

9265966 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster mccain says in an interview with fox news sunday that will be shown tomorrow
9265967 hurricane gustav is bearing down on the gulf coast are there any circumstances under which you would consider suspending the republican convention if the hurricane really bashes that part of the country
9265968 im afraid chris that we may have to look at that situation and well try to monitor it mccain replies in the interview an excerpt provided by fox
9265969 theres never been a time since ive been around where so many people have been knocked down and this government has paid so little attention

9265971 i am grateful for mr wilsons principled belief that the green party deserves a voice in parliament and for his firm commitment to democracy with a green mp sitting in the house of commons it will now be impossible to exclude the green party from the televised leaders debates in the next election
9265972 how many more victims are out there who dont know theyre victims
9265973 what is remarkable is that while you seem to have adopted wholeheartedly the more draconian aspects of american legislation evident in their dmca you have ignored its most democratic element fair use

9265983 the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race
9265984 im not sure if its been mentioned before as this thread is so long but crystal meredith was not the first parent to sue she was successful but deborah stallworth tried several years ago she wanted her child black to attend central and was denied stallworth was of great support to meredith throughout this ordeal im a product of the old louisville independent district i didnt need to sit next to white kids to learn i have three college degrees and i dont think black kids need it now im glad i wasnt bused and im grateful that my relatives living in louisville wont have to be
9265985 if central wants to maintain its black heritage then all liberals nod in simultaneous agreement all black is a good thing good for the kids black teachers good black principle good all black students good but god forbid a poor white child not have a minority is his class shudder the poor child is destined for failure please the truth is either the exact opposite or somewhere in the reasonable middle
9265986 a more bitter or unjustified blow is hard to conceive

9265996 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9265997 and it is warm not something im really used to
9265998 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too

9266003 both he and his wife have donated time and money over the years to various causes and organizations and done that anonymously

9266013 nice guy very talkative outgoing he had a nice family
9266014 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention

9266082 its very difficult at times to prove that these hires are being done for the specific intent to secure the recruitment of a prospect but that doesnt mean the enforcement staff is going to turn a blind eye
9266083 but you have to be accountable when you do something wrong
9266084 que se va a curar m s r pido que es m s potente
9266085 desde luego que como es de todos sabido hay una nueva generaci n de dispositivos intrauterinos que adem s de que contienen cobre liberan hormonas y entonces de alguna forma son mucho m s gentiles con el organismo no inducen una cantidad mayor de sangrado a la usuaria sino al contrario va disminuyendo de tal forma que son mucho m s seguros son muy efectivos y menos agresivos tambi n est n los implantes subd rmicos que tambi n se han promovido recientemente como el uniplant el implanon el norplant que son m todos de larga duraci n aqu la nica desventaja es que necesitan insertar en el organismo en el brazo de la usuaria tienen una duraci n de tres a seis a os y realmente son altamente efectivos la desventaja aqu es que dependen del prestador de servicio es decir que la usuaria tiene que ir a la cl nica para que el m dico la supervise y para que el m dico en determinado momento si hay alg n problema tenga que retirar el implante no lo puede hacer cualquier persona nosotros estamos promoviendo m todos que sean controlados por la usuaria
9266086 desde luego que s cada vez la mujer reclama m s que sean m todos adem s de amigables con ella que sean altamente efectivos pocos efectos secundarios pero que adem s los controle la usuaria el dispositivo no lo controla la usuaria el implante tampoco ahora hay otro nuevo que andan incluso hasta promocionando en los medios de comunicaci n que es el parche transd rmico son tres parches mensuales se pone uno cada semana la mujer y en la cuarta semana deja de usarlo y en ese momento viene la menstruaci n tambi n son efectivos est n a nivel experimental todav a aqu yo creo que la desventaja es de que se desprenda el parche que en ocasiones si dura m s tiempo puede ocasionar problemas de irritaci n en la piel en clima muy h medos y muy calurosos se puede llegar incluso a desprender
9266087 m xico desde luego tiene uno de los programas de salud reproductiva mejores del mundo de hecho ha servido de ejemplo el programa para otros pa ses de la regi n m xico fue uno de los primeros que adopt el nuevo concepto de salud reproductiva es decir no ver a la planificaci n familiar como tal sino verla dentro de un contexto de salud integral para la mujer para el hombre y para la pareja entonces deja de ser la planificaci n familiar una cuesti n restrictiva demogr fica de control de la natalidad y se convierte en un programa m s humano m s relacionado con la salud integral de las parejas y el bienestar de las parejas y de los individuos promueve la participaci n del var n se cre la norma oficial mexicana de servicios de planificaci n familiar en 1994 y hasta la fecha ha dado muy buenos resultados y los indicadores nos muestran que realmente s ha funcionado ahora las nuevas autoridades de salud reproductiva le han dado un cambio a esto para que sea m s incluyente que incluya salud sexual sexualidad responsable que es el nuevo concepto en donde la planificaci n familiar viene a ser una parte es incluyente porque abarca muchos otros temas y se le est dando nfasis a la prevenci n de problemas relacionados con la mujer y con el hombre por ejemplo c ncer de mama c ncer c rvico uterino en el caso del hombre c ncer de pr stata enfermedades de transmisi n sexual uno de los avances importantes fue la actualizaci n de la norma oficial mexicana de los servicios de planificaci n familiar que ocurri este a o 2004 en donde tuvieron la certeza y la voluntad de incluir temas como la anticoncepci n de emergencia que hab a estado en a os anteriores un poco rezagado en parte por el clima pol tico en parte por la cuesti n burocr tica interna porque desde el 94 se plante la necesidad de incluir a la anticoncepci n de emergencia en ese sentido la voluntad de las autoridades actuales hizo que finalmente se aprobara este m todo anticonceptivo que por cierto no es abortifaciente sino que es un m todo que previene el embarazo no deseado y en nuestro caso embarazo no deseado significa a todos los niveles a nivel de adolescentes a nivel de parejas establecidas cuando les falla el m todo primario pueden recurrir a la anticoncepci n de emergencia como m todo secundario en el caso de mujeres violadas tambi n es una opci n ltima muy noble para evitar un embarazo no deseado
9266088 no porque lleva una inercia los cambios importantes se hicieron antes de esto afortunadamente no se modific sustancialmente esa tendencia y la planificaci n familiar y la salud reproductiva est en la conciencia de las gentes y entonces esto es inercial es irreversible esperemos que siga avanzando pero en una forma m s c lida aqu en lo que se debe hacer nfasis ahora es en la calidad de la atenci n esta debe de reforzarse mucho incluir a los grupos que no escuchan bien el mensaje es decir los j venes y las j venes no se identifican con los mensajes estos de planificaci n familiar en la regulaci n de la fertilidad sin embargo se tiene que hacer nfasis desde luego en la equidad de g nero en aspectos relevantes de informaci n en consejer a para que se adopte concientemente un m todo de planificaci n familiar y en esa medida puedan adherirse m s al m todo y tener una mejor cobertura los j venes luego son una prioridad y otros aspectos importantes que deben enfocarse como son la calidad en la prestaci n de los servicios y la atenci n a grupos vulnerables como ser an j venes poblaci n ind gena poblaci n discapacitada y desde luego todo esto dentro de un marco de equidad de g nero es decir de justicia para ambos sexos y tomando en cuenta tambi n a los grupos minoritarios que tienen otras tendencias y conductas sexuales o sea incluyente
9266089 las m s importantes decisiones dependen de juicios acerca del futuro y estas decisiones se tomar n tanto si la ciencia est preparada como si no
9266090 me interesa el futuro porque es el sitio donde voy a pasar el resto de mi vida

9266106 dad i thought i heard a pig in our car
9266107 yo creo que este enfrentamiento con el pa s m s poderoso del mundo nos afecta porque se prende una televisi n y estamos viendo todo el mundo est viendo un mundo que nunca van a lograr esa frustraci n provoca muchos sinsabores sobre todo cuando vemos cosas tan tremendas como que no hay empleo como que no hay seguridad para las mujeres como que no hay refugios como que no hay tanta cosa que necesita nuestra sufrida gente que viene al norte llegan con las ganas de trabajar nicamente y con el valor de enfrentar una sociedad que les es adversa
9266108 el primer crimen registrado oficialmente tuvo lugar el 19 de agosto de 2002 cuando los restos de una mujer fueron encontrados calcinados en un recipiente luego el 30 de septiembre del a o pasado el cad ver de una joven la nica que ha sido identificada hasta el momento fue encontrado enterrado en un predio de la periferia el 14 de agosto los cuerpos mutilados de dos mujeres fueron hallados en el interior de bolsas de pl stico la ola delictiva no termin ah pues el 19 de marzo pasado apareci el cad ver de una mujer descuartizada
9266109 intenta matar a su esposa le prende fuego a su casa dice que lo hizo porque ella se iba a bailar con otros
9266110 la extraordinaria importancia en cuanto al n mero de v ctimas su sucesi n temporal a lo largo de una d cada la gravedad intr nseca a cada uno de los cr menes y la complejidad de la investigaci n requerida han puesto a prueba un sistema de por s insuficiente que ha sido desbordado por un desaf o criminal para el que no estaba preparado dando lugar a un colapso institucional que ha determinado la impunidad generalizada de los responsables de los cr menes
9266111 sabemos que no es natural la violencia se incuba en la sociedad y en el estado debido a la inequidad gen rica patriarcal
9266112 la violencia de g nero es un mecanismo pol tico cuyo fin es mantener a las mujeres en desventaja y desigualdad en el mundo y en las relaciones con los hombres permite excluir a las mujeres del acceso a bienes recursos y oportunidades contribuye a desvalorizar denigrar y amedrentar a las mujeres y reproduce el dominio patriarcal
9266113 el problema de la violencia domestica es que se paga con la vida todas las asociaciones con las que hemos trabajado dicen que las medidas que se han puesto en funcionamiento son parches creo que no se lo toman demasiado en serio hay que articular pol ticas eficaces y por supuesto dar medios no restringirlos los pol ticos y los jueces no le dan la importancia que tiene me impresiona mucho el silencio en el que viven su soledad que no cuentan sus casos a nadie y pueden pasar a os esa manera en la que se les hunde muchas dicen que lo peor no son los golpes sino reconstruirse por dentro
9266114 el feminicidio es el genocidio de mujeres y sucede cuando se atenta contra la integridad la salud las libertades y la vida de las mujeres
9266115 reconocer a mujeres que sean merecedoras de un reconocimiento por su participaci n activa en la vida pol tica de su entidad y represente el esp ritu de los logros del voto femenino
9266116 me llama mucho la atenci n que aqu mismo hayan matado a una fot grafa en soriana y nadie hace ni dice nada
9266117 yo quiero que la gente cuando salga de la funci n se conmueva salga pensando en la situaci n estamos muy comprometidas sabemos que tenemos una gran responsabilidad las actrices no van a lucirse no es un tema banal con adi s querida m a me di cuenta que todas las mujeres somos una sola nos falta mucho camino por recorrer nos espera una gran batalla debemos ayudarnos respet ndonos mutuamente
9266118 se imaginan escuchando eso en un bar bail ndolo las madres no necesitan eso lo que necesitan es que se respete su dolor no que comercialicen la tragedia con ello no creo que este tipo de gente tenga la m nima intenci n de ayudar son gente que no conoce el dolor yo creo que ni siquiera han ido a ju rez donde en cada poste de la luz hay una cruz por sus muertas
9266119 me parece indigno que los tigres del norte est n haciendo eso yo quisiera que la gente no les compre que no los haga m s ricos que no comercien con el dolor
9266120 intromisi n en asuntos que interesan s lo a los mexicanos
9266121 si a una le pasa algo a todas nos pasa yo creo que eso de entrometerse lo dicen los hombres las autoridades y las mujeres que hablan como persona no como mujeres no como g nero si todas las mujeres levant ramos la voz al mismo tiempo y dij ramos no a la guerra muy probablemente podr amos parar la guerra como mujeres s nos compete
9266122 at the moment all i know is i have the great pleasure to go and jam with the two guys and start work on some material
9266123 when i get there in the studio i never ask any questions if i get a phone call to go and play i enjoy every moment of it
9266124 whatever it ends up as to ever get a chance to jam with two people like that it is a phenomenal thing for me its my life its what ive dreamed about doing
9266125 lots of politics would need to get ironed out before an album could be made

9266130 pride goes before destruction a haughty spirit before a fall
9266131 sarah palin has long been considered to be a libertarian leaning republican as mayor of wasila anchorage suburb palin was friends with local libertarian republican elected officials and worked closely with them on tax cut proposals
9266132 she is known to have spoken to two libertarian party meetings in 2004 05 she was endorsed by the libertarian party of alaska in the final days of her race for governor in 2006 even though the lp had its sic own candidate on election night ms palin at the egan center went out of her way to acknowledge the libertarian partys support in her victory speech
9266133 governor palin was not endorsed by the rlc in 2006 but is somewhat allied with libertarian republicans in alaska the rlc recently endorsed her closely allied lt governor sean parnell in his race against don pork barrel young a race in which the results are too close to call at this time
9266134 mccains choice is an indicator that perhaps his campaign is interested in receiving votes from libertarian republicans
9266135 for republican nominee john mccain there are a numerous potential political downsides and upsides to choosing a relative unknown for vp but stepping outside the horserace aspects of 2008 palin is the most libertarian republican thats been on a major ticket for a long time this ideological storyline should appeal to many western voters
9266136 shes not a libertarian folks shes a conservative republican shes a pro war pro tyranny and anti freedom vice presidential pick theres nothing consistently libertarian about her
9266137 this development is so radically unexpected that it is hard to understand how it could have happened but i gather all solidly pro life americans are thrilled beyond measure about it i just saw pat buchanan on nbcs hardball go on and on with such enthusiasm i thought he was going to have a stroke that is how excited palin has made social conservative americans
9266138 the invasion and occupation of iraq were two separate mistakes which collectively have cost thousands of american lives and hundreds of billions of u s taxpayer dollars
9266139 the invasion and occupation of iraq were two separate mistakes which collectively have cost thousands of american lives and hundreds of billions of u s taxpayer dollars
9266140 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few the loss of liberty at home is to be charged to the provisions against danger real or imagined from abroad
9266141 thats absolute bull sh t libertarians understand the need for a state aparatus an administration as opposed to what we have now which is a fascist look it up mob rule style of government thing is we believe that this administration has a few basic functions and thats it posted by jc 30 aug 08 11 44 51 am
9266142 1 a person who advocates liberty esp with regard to thought or conduct 2 a person who maintains the doctrine of free will distinguished from necessitarian adjective 3 advocating liberty or conforming to principles of liberty 4 maintaining the doctrine of free will
9266143 sadly ron paul is the only person in national government that i know of that follows the letter and intent of the document and therefore the only one that upholds his oath of office and the voting public waits for promises of more socialism
9266144 and i didnt develop my views on libertarianism by reading a dictionary the scope there is far too narrow
9266145 maybe political libertarians must be anarchists but i kind of doubt it in any event your definition doesnt decide the matter one way or the other
9266146 while terrence and i might be wrong one reason to take our word for it is because were both phd students in philosophy specializing in political philosophy we also teach undergrads on this subject
9266147 1 a state of society without government or law 2 political and social disorder due to the absence of governmental control the death of the king was followed by a year of anarchy 3 a theory that regards the absence of all direct or coercive government as a political ideal and that proposes the cooperative and voluntary association of individuals and groups as the principal mode of organized society 4 confusion chaos disorder intellectual and moral anarchy followed his loss of faith
9266148 cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law and do them
9266149 unvaccinated people are carriers of disease and a danger to society
9266150 unvaccinated people danger others that are not able to be vaccinated because they are immune compromised and cannot be vaccinated or they are in the
9266151 likewise since their immune system cant fight off infection on its own these people really do rely on the immunity of others if everyone around me is immune the chances of me catching whatever illness is greatly reduced
9266152 viral bacterial mutation is vastly overestimated there are only 2 pathogens of any significance which readily change their genome hiv and the flu
9266153 that leaves a good 2 3 of the vaccinated people still at risk like in 1 these people rely on the rest of us to shield them from that virus
9266154 she does not give us anything much less replace one virus with another
9266155 do this often enough and viral disease will be gone forever
9266156 viruses have the potential to mutate the longer they are allowed to circulate the greater the risk they will
9266157 flu changes fairly slowly so a yearly vaccine usually does the trick last year was a fluke it usually works quite well
9266158 if present at all the benefit was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
9266159 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
9266160 controlling for those variables reduced the relative risk of death to a statistically non significant 19 percent
9266161 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality
9266162 further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
9266163 having had chicken pox in the natural way i am at risk for shingles in later life if youve ever treated a patient with shingles you know just how terribly painful that disease is if a chicken pox vaccine and a varicella one in adulthood can prevent shingles i am all for it
9266164 any possible shingles epidemic associated with the chickenpox vaccine can be offset by treating adults with a shingles vaccine
9266165 using a shingles vaccine to control shingles epidemics in adults would likely fail because adult vaccination programs have rarely proved successful
9266166 there appears to be no way to avoid a mass epidemic of shingles lasting as long as several generations among adults
9266167 the principal reason that vaccinees in japan maintained high levels of immunity 20 years following vaccination was that only 1 in 5 or 20 of japanese children were vaccinated
9266168 so those vaccinated received immunologic boosting from contact with children with natural chickenpox but the universal varicella vaccination program in the u s will nearly eradicate this natural boosting mechanism and will leave our population vulnerable to shingles epidemics
9266169 church of the lamb of god presumably the mormon church
9266170 consecrate your time talents and everything which the lord has blessed you or with which he may bless you to the church of jesus christ of latter day saints
9266171 you just dont who you are you dont know what you want yet
9266172 see lookie here we have a woman and your beloved dems dont
9266173 wtf who is she we dont know her how can she run the country if mccain has another bout with cancer i mean damn she was mayor of a town of 9 000 people the 2006 census shows alaska has a population of 670 053 http quickfacts census gov qfd states 02000 html hell memphis had 674 028 according to 2007 figures mccain tries to discredit obamas experience but he picks a runningmate whos been governor for 2 years
9266174 im going to leverage my hypocritical religious standing to curry votes so i can roll back the rights of women homosexuals minorities the poor and the real middle class as soon as im sworn in
9266175 she said oh come on boy arent you tired of talking about sex i said little girl what do you really expect and then she pledges her allegiance to the united states of me
9266176 you either hunt with the big dogs or you get on the porch with the pups
9266177 hey its good to see you what have you been up to
9266178 well im getting a divorce still working at the airport and my daughters in college now

9266181 i am the vine you are the branches if a man
9266182 at least youve got a reason now that would make me feel better
9266183 so all bore witness to him and marveled at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth
9266184 and when he was twelve years old they went up to jerusalem according to the custom of the feast when they had finished the days as they returned the boy jesus lingered behind in jerusalem they returned to jerusalem seeking him now so it was that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the teachers both listening to them and asking them questions and all who heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers
9266185 for there is born to you this day in the city of david a savior who is christ the lord
9266186 then he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subject to them but his mother kept all these things in her heart and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and men
9266187 the lord god has given me the tongue of the learned that i should know how to speak a word in season to him who is weary he awakens me morning by morning he awakens my ear to hear as the learned the lord god has opened my ear and i was not rebellious nor did i turn away i gave my back to those who struck me and my cheeks to those who plucked out the beard i did not hide my face from shame and spitting
9266188 is this not the carpenter the son of mary and brother of james joses judas and simon and are not his sisters here with us
9266189 do the rulers know indeed that this is truly the christ
9266190 however we know where this man is from but when the christ comes no one knows where he is from
9266191 the disciple jesus of 2 000 years ago has by now become one of the most senior masters in the hierarchy the master jesus
9266192 jesus of nazareth and maitreya the christ by peter liefhebber share international published by lucis publishing co peter liefhebber is a veteran dutch journalist
9266193 in reality jesus was a fourth degree initiate and one of the older disciples of the masters of wisdom he appeared before in biblical times as joshua the son of nun then as isaiah and again as joshua in the book of zachariah in palestine he made the great sacrifice of allowing himself to be used by maitreya to fulfill his mission during the three years following the baptism in the river jordan this is a fable which many of the occultists and initiates into secret wisdom teachings of the far east invent because they must deny the validity and accuracy of the bible who is god marilyn furgueson tells a story of a friend having a pantheistic revelation of god
9266194 teachings of the masters of the far east p 39
9266195 the christ is the master of all the masters but he is not god and never claimed to be god

9266211 i have five kids too and i think it is exciting when you see someone who is working actively to make her family a part of her mission
9266212 and her decision to have her child when she knew he had downs syndrome is a beautiful beautiful story
9266213 with this bold and inspired selection sen mccain has verified his stated commitment to assembling a truly pro life administration the republican ticket stands in stark contrast to the stridently pro abortion ticket put forth by the democratic party you can be sure the vice presidential selections will have far reaching ramifications in this race
9266214 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
9266215 you are the christ the son of the living god
9266216 how is such a well loved ballet company now facing the terrible reality of shutting its doors
9266217 evangelicals divorce do drugs drink alcohol have sex outside marriage have abortions you name it they do it at the same rates as everyone else
9266218 i guess any time something traumatic like this happens good people just crawl out of the woodwork
9266219 if people could just learn something from this how quick we can leave this world and be prepared
9266220 then there are those days that i think man look at everything ive been through and im standing
9266221 charlies one of the smartest political minds in the business
9266222 i think he shows us the worst side of how washington works
9266223 hes very much a player in what is ultimately a very small town
9266224 youd have to say this was one of the greatest political comebacks of any weve seen in modern history
9266225 ive proven to be pretty good at pulling strategies together and getting people to cooperate
9266226 the philosophy was what moved me limited government strong national defense stand up to communism
9266227 i saw the goal line i was mad on that one
9266228 that play it really changed the momentum said backup tailback shaun draughn
9266229 he can make guys miss and you need guys like that that can change field position and change the complexion of a ballgame
9266230 the only way to get out of debt is to give to gods work
9266231 it doesnt take a whole lot of faith for 50
9266232 the long and short of it i think hes a con man
9266233 youre not ready to die even though as a christian youre prepared to die
9266234 early on in my affiliation with the practice i was talking to an elderly lady who was a patient of marks
9266235 she said i thought i was being robbed but it was dr yoffe making a house call on the motorcycle
9266236 he was never afraid of being who he was even when he was calling on an elderly lady at night
9266237 one thing that impressed me was that he made direct eye contact with me the whole time
9266238 i took part in the marine corps marathon in 2004 it had been 24 years since i ran a marathon
9266239 i ended up running on the second hottest oct 31 in washington d c history
9266240 i was honored and humbled to be nominated for man of the year
9266241 when they asked me to get involved i asked what do you have to do
9266242 we are so proud to have him associated with us and have him as one of our friends
9266243 i have to walk the line of reality with them but i have to have some optimism or i couldnt stay in the business
9266244 did she make a mistake in helping her husband cover up the affair of course she did but she is far more the wronged party what she did was cover up for her husband i can understand that
9266245 for an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections
9266246 it really is looking at a practically impossible situation and making it happen just miraculously quickly
9266247 were trying to bring circus animals and have a carnival
9266248 i thing its very nice that someone wants to do this for us
9266249 i had no idea i would be doing this four months ago
9266250 having this project has been the perfect opportunity to gain the skills that i needed
9266251 i want to give back to people and this is a perfect opportunity
9266252 i was just looking around to see somebody else around me if theyd get that bounce
9266253 at halftime i told the team were giving it away
9266254 hello alison its me yeah corey hey listen i was just hello alison hello
9266255 we want 100 per cent evacuation if you decide to stay you are on your own
9266256 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day that im not sure weve seen anything like it this is the real deal
9266257 riding this storm out would be one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9266258 i dont want to see another katrina with dead bodies floating in the water
9266259 i saw elderly people floating i saw one body that really got to me a child floating and it just made me sick
9266260 the wind here is terrible this is looking very bad
9266261 i hope he doesnt leave the parliament and i hope hes available for higher duty
9266262 i would relish the opportunity each and every day and im sure treasurer wayne swan would relish it too
9266263 there are some very clear facts about mr costellos track record which im sure we would be pointing
9266264 i think brendan nelson is doing a terrific job under difficult circumstances
9266265 the question marks that are now very much hanging over the rudd government are due in large measure to brendan nelsons tenacity and political savvy
9266266 it was a tough choice it was a close choice
9266267 politik pr sentation in den usa immer noch sehr stark anderen mustern folgt als in deutschland
9266268 bei den etwas n chterner urteilenden deutschen ganz sicher nicht auf die gleiche akzeptanz sto en
9266269 nicht neu vorbereiten auf internationale politik oder auf die transatlantischen beziehungen
9266270 ist einer der in seinen reden durchaus scharf urteilt aber er ist ganz sicher auch ein berechenbarer politiker
9266271 ich finde bereinstimmung bei dem befund dass wir von beiden seiten des atlantiks viel f r die erneuerung der beziehungen tun und klassische sicherheitspolitische themen erg nzen m ssen um fragen der klimaschutz und energiepolitik
9266272 au erdem ist sein votum f r neue partnerschaften nach den erfahrungen der letzten jahre nicht nur f r die usa ein attraktives ziel der au enpolitik
9266273 its getting to the point in the season where were heading into september and he seems to have a lot left
9266274 he viewed it as a balanced polarity between good and evil
9266275 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
9266276 gov sarah palin vetoed a bill thursday that sought to block the state from giving public employee benefits such as health insurance to same sex couples
9266277 it makes you realize i can play at this level
9266278 it was impressive to see brian danaher a walk on kid
9266279 people were maybe assuming things about him being young but hes a die hard cougar
9266280 i was shocked they did a lot better than i thought theyd do
9266281 it was a dream i remember coming into these games when they first started in 2002
9266282 ive been to pretty much every one i could point to sections in the stands where i was sitting
9266283 zac has a lot of confidence in me he expects me to make that play so i expect myself to make that play
9266284 we had some potential big plays we didnt take advantage of
9266285 i didnt play to the best of my abilities we were slow and boring in the first half it wasnt the cougar offense youre used to
9266286 it is going to be a painstaking and lengthy process before the full examination of the house and its surrounds is completed
9266287 in the meantime we will keep an open mind concerning what we may or may not find
9266288 you dont look like a christian father he only takes them all for the orphans under his care
9266289 look at the way they put their feet up and set em down can they walk
9266290 lets assume youre football coach theres the opposing team you size em up hog judges look at kind of the same thing muscle agility body volume you have to have a pig that can function not be one of those stiff legged stress prone pigs
9266291 what an experience that kind of gets in your blood
9266292 the breeders took care of em the ones that tried to get away with something they didnt come back we dont need no cheaters
9266293 they treat you better here everything at wisconsin is rush rush rush
9266294 you had to park your truck and trailer five miles away
9266295 he treats everyone the same very approachable its a lot of little things
9266296 we used to not be able to open the windows
9266297 there was another story in 1735 in the boston evening post about a man and woman who came to be married but before the ceremony was over the woman gave birth to a daughter
9266298 things like that rivet our attention and apparently have done so since the time there were newspapers
9266299 we are continuing to navigate through the modern world with a stone age mind
9266300 who needs a favor who is in a position to offer one who is trustworthy who is a liar who is available sexually who is under the protection of a jealous partner who is likely to abandon a family who poses a threat to us
9266301 gee i dont want to get mixed up with this guy because even in my hour of greatest need i might not be able to count on him
9266302 people are always coming into town to sell farmers something
9266303 my husband is the one he really pushed this to get all those farmers on one wavelength
9266304 people are moving in and out almost like a precise ballet
9266305 the only problem is it doesnt come with a hookup to run an extension cord out to it
9266306 when the day is done a w is a w no matter how you get the job done
9266307 it showed how resilient we are i thought a lot of guys showed a lot of guts
9266308 i was thinking about getting in the end zone by any means necessary
9266309 if they put 11 guys in front of me i knew id have to find a way in
9266310 but i think well be able to swallow this one pretty easily
9266311 it was going to be bang bang usually when guys are hopping off the mound theyre kind of slinging and it tilts up the line a little bit
9266312 i was kind of leaning that way but it was on the other minnesota twins joe nathan makes an errant throw to third baseman brendan harris top left as oakland athletics bobby crosby slides to third base during the ninth inning of a baseball game saturday aug 30 2008 in oakland calif the throw by nathan which ended up in left field allowed crosby and as emil brown to score winning the game for oakland 3 2 ap photo ben margot side of my body i didnt have enough leverage to get enough glove on it to block it
9266313 even though it was a well placed bunt i felt like if i could bounce off the mound make a good throw i think we had him the throw beat him
9266314 but i think i cut it a little bit i know it was a tough read at third
9266315 it was right in the middle it was just in a good spot it would have been a tough play six inches either way and we have him
9266316 to both shut down the republican national convention and actually harm the officers that are working this convention
9266317 to go in and arrest people on conspiracy charges without any solid evidence is to start to criminalize protected political activity and speech
9266318 one this appears this might be a pre emptive strike to chill protesters on monday
9266319 two we always have concerns about any type of conspiracy arrests because conspiracy isnt an act in the normal sense of the word and three were concerned first amendment protected material may have been taken
9266320 we have worked very very hard to make sure weve protected peoples right to exercise free speech
9266321 to pick up a protest sign thats fine if youre here to pick up a brick or some other instrument theres a problem
9266322 were here to put to rest whether law enforcement is picking on civil protesters
9266323 long before we recovered this evidence here we began an investigation into an obvious attempt to block the entrances into downtown st paul
9266324 literally hundreds of anarchists from around the country all with the same goal of blocking the streets and stopping delegates from getting into the convention
9266325 we know that these items were going to be used because we had sources that were working inside
9266326 these people are some of the best people in our society
9266327 derail rnc protest organizing efforts and to intimidate and terrorize individuals and groups converging in the twin cities to exercise what are supposed to be their basic civil rights
9266328 we basically came out of there with our animals and the clothes on the back
9266329 format value from other fields function in the masstagger obviously there should be an option to overwrite existing playlist in case it already exists
9266330 weve talked about this before but you must keep your pants on at work
9266331 weve talked about this before but you must keep your pants on at work
9266332 i see you marrying either someone quite a bit younger than you or just a little older
9266333 i speak on behalf of humanity and the vast majority of international governments
9266334 we created many opportunities but it seemed like one of those nights when you just cant catch a break and then the break came in the last seconds of the game
9266335 atiba has been giving us a lot of minutes this year
9266336 he had one or two opportunities tonight and finally he got a goal in the last seconds of the game so im very happy for him hopefully he will get a lot of confidence from this
9266337 i thought it was going to come earlier it was suicide defending and thats not good enough that was disastrous for me thats the worst weve played im absolutely furious
9266338 ill take my hat off to preki he changed things he brought fresh legs on lets be honest i think they got the result they deserved
9266339 nos merecemos recuperar a m xico y la gente que est marchando se lo merece porque estamos trabajando para conseguirlo
9266340 despu s de la marcha del 2004 yo me fui a mi casa y todos esperamos una soluci n m gica que nos dimos cuenta que no se dio y no se dio porque ten amos que seguir participando y esa responsabilidad se la dimos a las autoridades y ya no hicimos nada
9266341 ojal y dios quiera que la encontremos viva o muerta
9266342 para exigir que las autoridades que son las responsables de mantener el estado de derecho lo hagan
9266343 hasta el momento no hemos visto ning n resultado desde hace muchos a os
9266344 virtually no one had heard of her a mccain adviser said
9266345 had long decided that mr mccains experience versus change argument against mr obama had run its course to the extent that it had worked at all
9266346 shes a woman governor with a newborn how motherly is that who exactly is caring for her child
9266347 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
9266348 im tired of singing and jogging im tired of riding elevators ive taken so many cold showers this week im starting to get diaper rash
9266349 quick which of your husbands annoying idiosyncrasies make you want to pound his lip with a frying pan
9266350 quick which member of the opposite sex do you find yourself thinking impure thoughts about
9266351 quick in lieu of cold showers what method do you use to combat temptation
9266352 please tell us of your latest dream about yet another male celebrity
9266353 the bush administration has not proven that it will effectively enforce labor and environmental provisions however good they may be
9266354 what you would see in an obama administration would not be an abandonment of trade expansion but rather an expansion of issues
9266355 dont tell me in mexico you expect to get the same kind of treatment that we give other democracies and then you dont act in a democratic way not on my watch
9266356 has fought to address the root cause of the dissatisfaction and subsequent instability that has plagued the region particularly in recent years tremendous social inequality
9266357 this isnt about the federal workforce this is about the management of the federal workforce
9266358 it is unreasonable and unfair to expect taxpayers to foot the bill for inefficiencies that federal agencies fail to address
9266359 this administration really distrusts government workers just right across the board
9266360 we can trust those guys the administration thought and theyre the private sector and theyll do it right
9266361 right now im sure that with the large contracts that we have been receiving
9266362 everybody every subcontractor that is who had my name in a rolodex has been calling me and everyone else they knew at shaw to get a piece of that
9266363 our consultants people who really delivered the bacon to us
9266364 a lot of lobbying and consulting efforts both in louisiana and in washington
9266365 really pays off when its time to get some contracts
9266366 people will be driving down oklahoma highway 66 which parallels this pasture and they will see this amazing amount of horse trailers and horses at a fast run through the pasture
9266367 many of them are from abroad who are on a route 66 tour
9266368 i always wonder about the history of the license plates i use what roads they may have traveled down and where they may be headed next
9266369 like the cars they once belonged to i hope my artwork will take fantastic journeys in the lives of their owners and always remind them of lifes eternal sense of whimsy and adventure
9266370 mestinya di wilayah itu paling banyak ada lima desa wisata sehingga upaya mengembangkannya bisa maksimal dan bisa menarik minat wisatawan berkunjung ke wilayah itu

9266374 rumah makan ada dimana mana bahkan rumah tempat tinggal saja dijadikan sebagai rumah makan yang ini sulit menarik retribusi karena berjualan di rumahnya
9266375 ini memang belum musim mekar jadi sedikit saja yang bisa kita lihat
9266376 bagi yang belum melihat dikiranya anggrek hitam itu berwarna hitam padahal kelopak bunganya putih kehijauan yang agak kehitaman hanyalah putik bunganya saja

9266381 sejak ada kafe jumlah pelanggan bertambah mereka senang mendengarkan musik sambil makan
9266382 tempat ini memang berkonsep torang samua basudara kami tak pandang dari suku dan agama mana kita ini bersaudara
9266383 memang awalnya salon tapi pengunjung lama lama minta dibikinin masakan manado macam macam lama lama malah restorannya yang maju daripada salonnya
9266384 orang manado mungkin hanya sekitar 25 persen sisanya suku suku lain jawa sampai bule warga negara asing
9266385 the united states federal government should provide adequate and affordable healthcare for all its citizens
9266386 let me get this straight you say that we shouldnt go to the hospital because there is a chance that there may be a mistake made in our case
9266387 so for example if someone was deathly ill they shouldnt go to the hospital they should just sit around and die while watching wheel of fortune
9266388 i had faith in your plan paul i had faith the whole time
9266389 la administraci n bush no ha demostrado que har cumplir con efectividad las disposiciones laborales y ambientales por muy buenas que parezcan
9266390 lo que se ver a en una administraci n obama no ser a un abandono de la expansi n del comercio sino m s bien una expansi n de los temas
9266391 no me digan que en m xico esperan recibir el mismo trato que le damos a otras democracias cuando no act an en forma democr tica
9266392 ha luchado por responder a la causa fundamental de la insatisfacci n y de la resultante inestabilidad que ha asolado a la regi n particularmente en los ltimos a os la tremenda inequidad social
9266393 he didnt want to go with the deputy and became combative
9266394 in an effort to protect mr jones and himself from injury the deputy used his taser
9266395 j w is an exceptional young man who is the chief aide to the attorney general and who is almost indispens able in terms of the many functions he carries out in this office
9266396 if i go to the hearing it will be to make the point that while i think there have been certain abuses by the administration impeachment in my opinion ought to be reserved for someone who commits a demonstrable violation of the federal criminal statutes i dont think its been proven or established that president bush did that
9266397 an idiot is one who is of non sane memory from his birth by a perpetual infirmity without lucid intervals and those are said to be idiots who cannot count 20 or tell the days of the week or who do not know their fathers or mothers or the like
9266398 the benefit of doubt has to be given to the accused
9266399 the aim of this years festival is to showcase just how absolutely versatile and unique our film industry is besides rays retrospective we have ventured beyond bollywood and have a true representation of indian cinema by giving a platform to some of the finest regional films from our country
9266400 rays films have a huge following among the western audience and its the best platform to bring in a wider audience we are thrilled to showcase five of rays classics on the big screen in new enhanced prints including the eternal much loved timeless classics pather pachali and apur sansar which break all cultural and language barriers
9266401 i am big fan of indian cinema it helps me keep the connection with indian culture
9266402 watching hindi films also complements my other talent i am learning bollywood dancing
9266403 since watching bend it like beckham i have been smitten by indian cinema as it answers a lot of questions about my family who are originally from mauritius which has a strong indian influence
9266404 it is a good idea to broaden the festival now the diverse range in this years festival gives films more validity and helps people understand that indian cinema has a lot of variety and it is not all song and dance
9266405 ray is one of those maestros whose films have not been easily accessible on dvd so this is a unique opportunity to see how his films have stood the test of time
9266406 bois reported 6 crores net in the weekend was overreprted tarans weekend number of 5 crores seems to be more precise
9266407 bah was always competing with sik was it not in week two bah had to contend with sik in week 3 and phoonk ro and many other lesser releases so if sik can take a hit why not bah
9266408 tango taran published it early according to time stamp it could be argued that boi used to publish indore s and taran followed him
9266409 one from a house that has just one lagaan before with no distribution clout
9266410 a much heralded future star who has had a lavish launch in saawariya hot bombshell bipasha after the sucess of race and a heroine who is being touted as a numero one heroine fresh from the success of blockbuster om shanthi om
9266411 we had already made a film out of so extensive and controversial a topic but it was just adam sandlers tactics that we managed to settle it down in a pretty light way in fact it was his idea only which came to its ultimate projection you dont mess with the zohan is about zohan dvir played by adam sandler who is an israeli mossad agent who dreams of becoming a hairstylist on a mission to recapture the phantom a known terrorist he takes advantage of the showdown to fake his own death armed with his scissors and his coveted book of hip hairstyles he heads for america shunned by the uptight salons of new york he makes a name for himself in a lesser known barber shop
9266412 the film basically deals with enmity between israel and palestine but this topic is dealt with in a humourous way
9266413 its not as crazy as it sounds the people living in conflict in the middle east are the same people living in one neighbourhood in new york except that while there may be rivalries in gaza they dont hate each other in brooklyn everybody just gets along they treat each other more as people than as rival factions you dont mess with the zohan is a comic way of sort of getting at the west side story aspect of life so i think the subject itself was controversial and that is why i doubted that some middle east countries wouldnt be showing it but i am happy that the film has been understood well and is not offensive so this is particularly one reason we mentioned the credits of the song jimmy jimmy thats perhaps to stay out of any controversy
9266414 let me clear that my perception for this song to be featured in zohan was made when i came across jimmy jimmy and not tes ok so it was something like jimmy jimmy that i had wanted in zohan therefore for me it was necessary to accredit the makers of this song and deal with people acquiring rights of this song only i dont know who lifted which song neither do i want to get into the core of this i tried to accomplish my duty had i thought of ottawans song first i would surely have credited it in zohan
9266415 although i have grown up on the ottawan track i dont find any similarity between that and jimmy jimmy
9266416 bappi can even claim that he conceived the tune for jimmy while taking a bath one fine 1976 afternoon he has no doubt composed some good tracks like chalte chalte but he is a hopeless liar when it comes to crediting his inspirations the man has to repent
9266417 this woman had a down syndrome baby for a photo op and burnish her anti abortion cred and then shoves the kid off on other family members or her husband the womans a narcissist
9266418 she looks like sally field and sounds like katie couric i can never see her standing up to putins russia or the iranians like shooting unarmed moose in a controlled environment in alaska is the same thing right
9266419 the ability to reach out not just to government leaders but to the people of our allies
9266420 he will be able to communicate more effectively with the leaders of our allies and the people that this is their fight too i think that level of communication hasnt been forthcoming from president bushs administration they have been preoccupied with iraq which is not a conflict that has a lot of popular support
9266421 i believe that one of the things he will bring to the challenge of bringing more resources to afghanistan is clarity of where the serious issue is it is along that afghani pakistan border this will be a priority with president obama
9266422 bollywood cinema is indias foremost artistic export so the narrowness of these audiences is striking its hard to imagine a bolshoi world tour playing to 90 per cent russian migr s or the berlin philharmonic appealing exclusively to german expats
9266423 if anything was going to raise international awareness of bollywoods unique brand of magic this unforgettable tour should have been it
9266424 we dont look into that aspect we are contracted to go and perform the pricing and the ticketing and the sales are sic all done by promoters
9266425 the lights are so bright we never get to see whos sitting in the audience and who they are
9266426 it was more us wanting to meet our audiences just an opportunity for us to come and meet the fans and to give them the opportunity to see us live
9266427 vishal shekhar duo as having said that 85 to 90 per cent of the audience are from the diaspora
9266428 arbolist look up the word i dont know maybe i made it up anyway its an arbo tree ist somebody who knows about trees
9266429 the russians have checkpoints and we still cannot bring these people back home the threat of paramilitary irregulars looting and robbing is still very high
9266430 apparently the russian military are not willing to prevent these kind of cases
9266431 c ourts commonly assume that certain types of bilateral treaties such as
9266432 property shall not be taken except for a public purpose nor shall it be taken without the prompt payment of just compensation
9266433 only set s forth substantive rules of conduct and state s that compensation shall be paid for certain wrongs do es not create private rights of action for foreign corporations to recover compensation from foreign states in united states courts
9266434 historically the economy seems to matter and given the state of the economy it should be giving obama an edge

9266528 im shocked by the video when i look at amy i think for christs sake just get a grip of yourself
9266529 as the police know amy is a drug addict and she has now been caught twice on film taking illegal drugs they should arrest her and put her behind bars
9266530 rehab clinics are a waste of money unless you want them to work
9266531 amy doesnt want to give up drugs so shes got to learn the hard way in prison
9266532 police have to act she is making a mockery of the law it has got to stop
9266533 the price amy has got to pay is losing her freedom
9266534 my position is that a sensible jury would not expect people to be sniffing talcum powder
9266535 prison has helped blake give up drugs and hes doing brilliantly in edmunds hill
9266536 when he went in pentonville last november he was in a terrible mess his skin was a horrible dirty yellow colour he was painfully thin and he had dead eyes i will never forget that haunted look i feared we were going to lose him
9266537 but they gave him amazing medical treatment in prison to get him off drugs and then helped him conquer his personal demons
9266538 now nine months on he looks amazing he has put on nearly two stone in weight his skin is glowing with health and he is so relaxed and happy
9266539 but while blake has been inside amy has gone disastrously downhill
9266540 prison worked for blake its the only thing that can now save amy
9266541 blakes been given his own room with an ensuite shower
9266542 he also has a tv cd player and a shelf full of books in his room
9266543 he even has his own key so he can lock himself in if he wants privacy
9266544 its so much nicer than pentonville which was the pitts
9266545 and the difference in blake since hes been in there is absolutely amazing
9266546 they are respectful and dont even mention her name to him
9266547 instead of doing work in prison blake has chosen to do an educational course to keep him busy and is doing art and writing
9266548 the video will come as a bitter blow to him
9266549 i hope this time it works but i have heard it so many times before i havent any faith in her
9266550 amy tried to get in to see blake last weekend but was turned away because she was too late
9266551 we didnt have a driver when we visited blake but she had a driver and she still couldnt turn up on time
9266552 blake was not impressed he is only allowed three visits a month
9266553 since blake has been in prison amy has just deteriorated more and more while he has managed to get himself clean inside
9266554 blake told me i promise you mum when i get out of prison i will sort amy out
9266555 but she has deteriorated to such an extent that i know even blake cant save her now
9266556 she needs to stay in there for the next four months until blake comes out of prison or be locked up in jail until she gets herself clean
9266557 blake hopes she will beat drugs for him and save their marriage
9266558 but its clear amy loves drugs more than her husband
9266559 weve been going against each other for 30 days so we were ready to go
9266560 this win really validates all the hard work we put in
9266561 when vanessa plays like that she gives us a huge lift
9266562 as a coach you always like it when those threes go down
9266563 she hit a couple big shots we found a play we were able to go to
9266564 this head coaching thing is just a title were all doing the same things we did before its not broke and im not going to try and fix it
9266565 youre playing on your home field and in front of these fans the greatest fans in the world and the way our defense played and the way our offense came out and played
9266566 we wanted to get a good w on the board for tschimperle right away because we knew there was a lot of pressure on him
9266567 i feel the same as i did when i was the head coach
9266568 and i dont like that feeling im still as nervous and edgy as ever i guess that feelings ingrained
9266569 doses a screamer and a yeller tschimp seems to get right to the point and he knows what hes talking about so does dose but hes a little feistier
9266570 i think theyll probably try to keep as much consistency as they can with all the success theyve had over the years
9266571 its hard to replace good people whether theyre players or coaches
9266572 and i felt very confident we could convert on fourth down convert and then go score thats what we did
9266573 coach put the ball in my hands and i just tried to come through
9266574 we knew duane would get us that yard and he did
9266575 this was going to make or break us i know we had a lot of heartbreaks last season we all wanted this one
9266576 decker is such a great athlete that we have him a part of it and he showed what he could do in this game
9266577 after the season we had last year we just werent going to give up
9266578 we never got down on ourselves as a team we knew that if we got the ball with some time left we could make something happen luckily we put the ball in at the end
9266579 we had no choice but to win this game we went into spring ball preparing for this game we knew after this game we had to be 1 0
9266580 sometimes you take wins for granted we learned last year you cant do anything like that we stuck with the game plan and never gave up on each other we have really grown and know its about continuing that into our next game
9266581 mike had the complete respect of the players sold them that defense would win it and the chemistry on this team was great
9266582 is very athletic has some power and is a much more polished player than i thought he was
9266583 meeting my norwegian fans was an awesome experience from the time i landed i did so much from the royal palace to the end of the world i took pictures for the media everywhere
9266584 id like to thank wicked and erotikknett no for allowing me to travel to such an amazing place to meet so many fans when i danced at the show friday and saturday in front of thousands it was a dream come true and i think they enjoyed it as much as i did i look forward to next year
9266585 its a w said steve erban a gophers booster as he exited the dome
9266586 average is about the worst thing you can say about somebody
9266587 i was sitting out there in the ninth going well i left a small village on base but at least we can close it out with a win
9266588 i think if there was a better throw we get him
9266589 when we get our closer in normally its a done deal
9266590 it just didnt work out tonight we couldnt finish them off very tough loss
9266591 joe nathans a great athlete thats why we made him the closer
9266592 he can field his position he can do a lot of things i dont think it was the wrong decision i thought we had him if we execute
9266593 we had bad weather cool and wet during the peak of the pheasant hatch said kurt haroldson dnr wildlife biologist generally that means bad news for pheasant production he said
9266594 normally i would forecast a decline in the pheasant population he said
9266595 but we also have a lot of hens out there and that could compensate for the weather
9266596 i told the guys something was wrong and i had to go home i just wasnt feeling right wahl said
9266597 i got dealt a bad hand wahl said last week
9266598 but the world doesnt owe me anything ive had a good life ive caught a couple of big fish and had a lot of fun
9266599 but i stopped counting he said his biggest a 56 incher and a couple of 54 inchers
9266600 george is just a wonderful guy said russ peterson 62 of minnetonka who wahl introduced to muskie fishing
9266601 everywhere he goes people know him said paul hartman 38 of blaine a longtime friend and fishing partner
9266602 thats what happens when youre the guy selling the best big fish bait made the eagle tail has caught more 50 inch fish in muskie contests than any other bait
9266603 a muskie almost jumped in my boat chasing a lure he said
9266604 it was a big fish too it scared me to death you see something like that it changes your life
9266605 since 1976 ive only caught one walleye and that was by accident
9266606 walleyes are great you can catch them all he quipped
9266607 i figure ive crossed the border up and back about 252 times
9266608 you literally eat sleep and breathe muskies period he once said
9266609 were the biggest muskie expo in the country he said
9266610 well in ten years it wont matter you will look back and laugh

9266642 mr kanjorski is either afraid to debate lou barletta face to face or he knows his record is simply indefensible and he would rather hide than face voters in northeastern pennsylvania
9266643 in either case it clearly shows that paul kanjorski does not deserve another term representing the great people of the 11th congressional district
9266644 the congressman has a job to do in september in the capital and hes going to continue to fully represent the people of the 11th despite the time demands of the campaign we simply have too many commitments in october after congress adjourns to fit in any other debates
9266645 the tax rebates contained in the economic stimulus act of 2008 were controversial because most economists doubted they would fire up the national economy enough to justify their cost
9266646 less controversial however was the fact that once congress and the president decided to go ahead with the program they made it means tested that is they excluded high earners based on a complex formula
9266647 federal politicians are learning from their state and local brethren
9266648 politicians seem to love such programs so much they are even willing paradoxically to raise taxes to support them new jersey began a rebate program in the late 1990s when the state was running huge budget surpluses using state funds to offset high local property taxes but as jerseys spending rose and the 2002 recession cut tax revenues the state raised dozens of taxes including those on businesses and high income earners but it kept paying out the rebates as politicians argued that in hard times the refund checks were even more important of course the state eliminated those refund checks for high income earners the very same people whose taxes it had raised to keep the states budget afloat in the first place
9266649 despite claims by their proponents most property tax rebate programs dont really subsidize working families anyway most are heavily oriented toward retired senior citizen homeowners who are reliable voters on the spurious notion that those on a fixed income are hurt most by such a regressive tax but income is a poor measure of household wealth although the typical over 65 household earns only half the annual income of a household headed by someone aged 35 44 senior households also have an average of three times the assets of these younger families and far fewer family members to support still virtually all property tax rebate programs take tax money paid by our most productive workers and use it to relieve the burden of those who are no longer working but who may have spent a lifetime accumulating wealth

9266679 mccain knows something that most people dont about the fundamentals of the race perhaps he has reason to believe that despite surface appearances he is way behind and needs to shake things up badly if he has any chance to win in that case the palin pick is not merely risky it is a necessity

9266699 weve got fast receivers on the outside and we took advantage of it
9266700 its a scary moment when an impact player like that goes down
9266701 this will be a challenge for our team and itll be interesting to see how they respond
9266702 well have to keep working hard this week and correct our mistakes

9266709 when youre training and wondering why you do all the work and feeling sorry for yourself and what have you you kind of push through and keep working
9266710 then when you have moments like that on the court you know you feel like its all worth it
9266711 i still cant believe it i was playing great and he was playing great too
9266712 so right now im just hoping to win my next match
9266713 hes paid his dues i think hes really ready to move forward
9266714 he has the experience and hes had the opportunity to play matches against all kinds of players so i think its now his chance to do it
9266715 won the first set i remember so that was cool
9266716 like the main thing from that match i remember i was playing at 2 p m and i knew espn went on the air at 3 i wanted to make it to 3 to get some espn time which i did hopefully ive gotten a lot better since then he has too
9266717 he has improved a lot and he has that powerful serve
9266718 ive had enough kidnapping corrupt police a rotten judicial system
9266719 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive maybe nothing like this has happened to them or they would be more sensitive
9266720 the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities their insensitivity

9266727 weve heightened our surveillance to try and identify any new cases that might occur we may have another case or two in the next few weeks but were confident now weve pulled all the implicated product off the shelves

9266740 weve all had it so we dont know how to live without it
9266741 we have established ourselves as a party that cannot be described as fringe we are a party whose ideas and policies are now in the mainstream of the public debate
9266742 at this point it has nothing to do with the liberal party
9266743 it is a private family matter between myself and my wifes stepfather
9266744 its looking more likely than it was before these meetings but the fact that the liberal party is refusing to meet with us is i think a bad sign that they are not interested in co operating
9266745 when one offers to have a meeting and when one offers to have a phone call and theres no response and no agreement to even do that its hard to imagine how you can have a parliament work when you cant even get agreement to have a conversation
9266746 it seems to me that harper seems rather intent on quitting his job
9266747 i told him that if hes prepared to quit his job he can explain that failure to canadians i intend to apply for his job with a team of new democrats and a set of ideas that will respond to the real concerns of canadians
9266748 the russians have checkpoints and we still cannot bring these people back home the threat of paramilitary irregulars looting and robbing is still very high
9266749 apparently the russian military are not willing to prevent these kinds of cases
9266750 escalate tensions in europe through speculation over non existent threats to other former soviet republics
9266751 we want the european union to be united and react to this situation adequately it is clear now that this is not only about georgia it is about europes security
9266752 we dont suggest a complete isolation of russia but on the other hand appeasement policy will be even more dangerous
9266753 i came to this job under a legal mandate i will only go if the law does not allow me to stay and not simply because someone issues threats and puts pressure on me

9266781 the last time i was off contract was at the end of 2003 i remember i just came back from a kangaroos tour with the australian team and i was at that point where i wanted to see if any clubs were interested

9266783 wayne had a massive part to do with that he has brought stability to the place for a long time
9266784 he does a great job with his players not just as footballers but in giving them direction in life
9266785 im a person who likes stability if over the years the broncos had gone through a few coaches my pathway may have been different
9266786 its just the person he is its his demeanour the way hes in control of his life and himself hed make a fine coach
9266787 its a wonderful moment for him 300 games hes done everything hes inspirational hes a wonderful player hes got great gifts but hes made them even better by his attitude to everything
9266788 im pleased to be coaching him in his 300th game

9266795 thats the sort of pressure we want pressure i believe is a privilege if we win 5 0 which is a goal then it takes us up to the top with australia if we keep delivering theres no reason why we cant do it
9266796 everyone is under serious threat at the moment we are going to need some big performances from them its up to the youngsters in the next two games to put their hands up and stake a claim for places
9266797 we have four quicks and three spinners and the selectors obviously want to look at a few players there for the touring party later in october there is no shane warne no adam gilchrist no glen mcgrath no justin langer no damien martyn you name it we took a 15 member squad to west indies which was our last tour in june and there is no doubt that the selectors will be looking closely at the performances of guys in this series
9266798 there are some impressive talent like phillip hughes we have not signed up anybody yet as we are waiting for the ipl council to lay down the ground rules for selection for this season but yes we will be following the series closely
9266799 definitely the guys in the odi series will get a chance to showcase their potential but i dont think they will be viewing it that way when you are playing for australia a you see the opportunity to press for a place in australia but if obviously they attract the attention of ipl scouts they would be happy
9266800 i was surprise opener in the west indies i had not done it a lot and it was a nice to get an opportunity young phillip hughes will get an opportunity here to open the batting we have had lots of young players here who had a good domestic season last year we are lucky that our domestic cricket provides good competition and players that have been picked all warrant to be here
9266801 if matthew hayden is fit and back he will be obviously back into the team hopefully a good performance here will help me to be picked for the test tour as the extra batsman in the test team at the moment there could be a opportunity in the middle order as well depending some one gets injured or some one getting sick you just have to wait and see what happens
9266802 you have to be very patient here things can take a while to happen here be it in batting or bowling last time when we were here we were very disciplined in not only our preparation but also how we played we probably backed off a little bit we werent probably as attacking as we had been in the past and that certainly helped our cause the other thing we learnt was that the quick bowlers played a huge role in winning the test series obviously shane warne bowled beautifully but our three quicks helped in setting up that win
9266803 hopefully after ipl the relations between the two sides will be much better guys have played with each other
9266804 we were mates we got along well and there would be no dramas between us
9266805 ive got a dressing room that is a little bit down in confidence but well sit down and hammer home the basics again
9266806 its up to the youngsters in the next two games to stick their hands up and stake a claim its up to us to bring those young guys forward as quickly as we possibly can and the starting point for me is lords
9266807 that could be the starting point of a new generation for the south african one day side thats how weve got to look at it and how im trying to package it
9266808 ive been very disappointed by how england have outplayed us in all three disciplines how we havent applied the basics enough
9266809 thats my major worry and that is up to us as a coaching staff to get right i see that as a major challenge for my management team now if we can see this as a challenge and get the team moving to where we want it i am really looking forward to the next couple of months
9266810 but this really is a time for us to start moving out of an era when we were very very good forward to the world cup in 2011
9266811 i really think it is time for us to re evaluate where we want to go re evaluate our personnel and start a new era for south africa in terms of one day cricket and getting ready for the world cup in 2011

9266828 andrews going to take some time to reflect on whats happened
9266829 hes still committed to playing cricket at the highest level how he goes about doing that and how it plays out i dont know whether it means india i dont know
9266830 they dont miss a thing and they are always early and presented as well as they possibly can
9266831 when somebody hasnt got the information that they need or hasnt turned up on time its usually due to the fact theyre away from us and the group a little bit mentally that always raises concerns
9266832 it was a surprise but there were issues last summer that have been well documented
9266833 our role is obviously were here to support andrew weve been in discussion with his manager and look to put in place the best possible support for him
9266834 i cant control their mental frame of mind when they get out there
9266835 the shot selection premeditated shots like ashs its a little disappointing
9266836 a couple of the guys had it in their mind about mitchell johnson and so on and i dont think mitchell bowled that fast today
9266837 the wicket slowed him up a fair bit so the batsmen can probably have a look at that now and say well its not the type of wicket that hes going to bowl 100 miles an hour
9266838 we can take away the unknown now theyve seen geeves theyve seen mitchell johnson they dont need to be frightened of their pace any more most of the guys got out there and faced either of those two they can take that away and come back the next game and play some better shots and be a bit more patient
9266839 its something that you see a lot with our guys
9266840 they dont look uncomfortable at that level but they get out with some silly shots i can yell and scream at them or i can take them to the nets and keep working at it i think ill take them to the nets
9266841 hes a freak he stood up he made sure he was going to be there at the end he helped the boys around him he played that support role through the middle and then enjoyed the last few overs
9266842 geevesy really looked forward to today once he found out hed been selected he was very excited he was dying for an opportunity
9266843 it shows the strength of australian cricket guys just keep coming in and keep stepping up
9266844 tu n invites pas untel de la famille cela va jaser
9266845 if its not a problem to you and you seem to have dealt with it well since youve been three its not a problem

9266851 it should come as no surprise that dr martin luther king jr was a republican in that era almost all black americans were republicans why from its founding in 1854 as the anti slavery party until today the republican party has championed freedom and civil rights for blacks and as one pundit so succinctly stated the democrat party is as it always has been the party of the four ss slavery secession segregation and now socialism
9266852 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
9266853 by the time he was nominated clarence thomas had worked in the missouri attorney generals office served as an assistant secretary of education run the equal employment opportunity commission and sat for a year n the d c circuit court of appeals the nations second most prominent court since his elevation
9266854 even he knows that clarence thomas is eminently more qualified to sit on the supreme court than obama is to sit in the oval office
9266855 the myth developed that when there was a tough vote he was gone
9266856 i think obamas going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
9266857 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
9266858 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished

9266921 in my view we could also reduce preventable foreclosures if investors acting in their own self interests were to permit servicers to write down the mortgage liabilities of borrowers by accepting a short payoff in appropriate circumstances for example servicers could accept a principal writedown by an amount at least sufficient to allow the borrower to refinance into a new loan from another source a writedown that is sufficient to make borrowers eligible for a new loan would remove the downside risk to investors of additional writedowns or a re default this arrangement might include a feature that allows the original investors to share in any future appreciation as recently suggested for example by the office of thrift supervision servicers could also benefit from greater use of short payoffs as this approach would simplify the calculation of expected losses and eliminate the future costs and risks of retaining the troubled mortgage in the pool

9267041 and with this selection john mccain hit it out of the park
9267042 even those of us who supported other candidates are four square behind john mccain
9267043 when i saw the e mail confirming palins selection i was like wow weve really got a complete ticket the democratic ticket is all about making history but our ticket is about leadership experience and making history so we sort of kill two birds with one stone
9267044 a lot of those 18 million clinton voters feel disenfranchised and betrayed

9267047 someone came upstairs with a gun dragged me down by my hair and told me to get on the floor
9267048 when they went outside with all of the stuff my son got loose
9267049 when the men came back they asked where he was and i said he had gone outside that is the only thing that saved us
9267050 i had a gun to my head and my son is still missing i need some kind of closure
9267051 im over here all banged up and beat up calling myself retired and all of a sudden i find out one of my 45s is selling for 100
9267052 i remember when they were 69 cents and when they went on sale two for a dollar

9267059 what can i do to get a piece of this
9267060 in pre air conditioning days this capital city was an officially designated hardship post for diplomats because of our swampy sweltering unhealthy climate
9267061 the story is that washington was a hardship post for diplomats when there was malaria on the potomac
9267062 as far south as the boundaries of natal on the east and cape colony on the west
9267063 spot checks on our lists prior to 1907 did not yield any reference to washington
9267064 the quantity being moved around by these kids is amazing to me
9267065 if the roughest place youve been to is the food court at a shopping mall youre in for a surprise
9267066 ed im sorry about the problems but i cant do much as i am somewhere in the middle of the caribbean i have absolutely no clue where
9267067 i was spending 100 a week in gas teachers dont make that much money to begin with and to spend that much money to go to work was very difficult
9267068 it was a very hard decision i loved teaching at cash and really enjoyed my co workers and principal judy jones
9267069 were only paid once a month so i will be seeing a very significant savings it will make each month easier
9267070 this was the first year weve heard from more than one teacher who was transferring because of gas prices
9267071 we lost several to guilford davidson and davie counties in some instances teachers took pay cuts to save money overall
9267072 sometimes this affects classified staff more because they do not earn as much as the instructional positions
9267073 we had one from guilford county whose baby was in day care in browns summit she couldnt afford to drive to cash and to keep her child in day care over there so we lost her
9267074 last spring we did see an increase in carpooling among employees especially with those who live on the western side of forsyth county
9267075 the commute is definitely worth it to me to work at cash but now i can go and go so that makes it easier
9267076 my perception is that the economy means that we are seeing fewer teachers leaving the profession or retiring early because they cant afford it jeffers said
9267077 last summer the system hired more elementary teachers this year there werent as many hires i think people are staying in their jobs even if they are transferring to schools closer to their homes
9267078 thats how high gas prices are tell whoever the next president is we need to bring gas prices down
9267079 certainly being associated with the organization makes that a lot more possible there have been conversations for a lot of years about me being part of a performance at a super bowl
9267080 im hoping that this leads definitely to that this whole process is basically you scratch my back ill scratch yours
9267081 is it comfortable to live in zero gravity or do you like it better on earth

9267119 it is more an issue of validation and in that sense they feel validated
9267120 regardless of whether such allegations were credible withdrawn or ultimately found to be false
9267121 i think it was a mutual thing the plaintiffs wanted to sit down and talk the bishop wanted to get these things resolved i think everybody thought it was time to sit down and talk about the case
9267122 as we asked you last year and the year before and the year before that please keep new orleans in your thoughts
9267123 because theyre gonna need it tough times are about to hit our state again
9267124 its gut wrenching to have to go through this again
9267125 youre surrounded by people who love our music how can you not feel better
9267126 it was so sad they were afraid to pray together in the home
9267127 thats kind of the whole idea behind the governors executive order nobody seems to want to recognize the degree of arrogance on illegal aliens part whenever they fearlessly evade the law to enter the country and live off of the backs of tax paying rhode islanders
9267128 then the legal hispanic citizens should be the most outraged at those who are entering the country illegally yet we never seem to find any hispanic citizens against illegal immigration group out there nor do we find outrage from union leadership even though businesses are undercutting the wages of rhode island workers by hiring illegal immigrants i wonder why that is
9267129 the governors executive order is doing more than the governor ever expected it to do its doing a lot of good illegal aliens are leaving the state on their own
9267130 has an obligation to enforce the laws in the purview he is allowed
9267131 the executive order is very narrow in focus it deals primarily with state police the department of corrections and state contractors thats it
9267132 to study and report back to him for any unintended consequences for legal immigrants
9267133 are completely separate from the governors executive order but it certainly does underscore that rhode island does have an issue with illegal immigration there are illegal immigrants that are here breaking the law
9267134 a lot of these tensions and hostility against immigrants were in the air before
9267135 but since march we are seeing them now manifest much more publicly latino people have become more fearful and isolated and they dont trust anyone outside of their community
9267136 these are people who are not undocumented they have applications in process and yet because they look hispanic and dont have a great grasp of the english language they are very nervous
9267137 are moving out of state to massachusetts or down south where the cost of living is cheaper and the atmosphere is more welcoming
9267138 im legal and ive been here since i was 5 years old but people look at you and see you are spanish and think you are illegal
9267139 people hear you speaking spanish and they look at you like there is something wrong like you dont belong here
9267140 the messages said i want you to go back to your country you wetback and we dont want you guys here things like that
9267141 i got about 20 of those messages and finally i texted back that i would report them to the police and they stopped
9267142 i dont even go out of the house just here and to church if the police see a hispanic face they stop the car
9267143 the green grocer down the street says its the same for him a lot of people who used to come all the time now arent here
9267144 many people have changed the way they live their lives and are afraid to go out even to the supermarket
9267145 they think immigration is at price rite waiting to arrest people thats not true but it shows just how afraid people are to go out and its the children who suffer because now they are cooped up in the house all the time
9267146 were watching to see who is knocking on the door
9267147 im not saying bad things at all about this country
9267148 im very grateful but these are difficult times my children keep telling me this is the only place the only country they know im praying things will get better
9267149 we had no shows of as much as 40 percent
9267150 people were very very afraid to come out of their houses
9267151 i literally had people calling the show to ask if it is safe to go to the doctor and had another lady call to ask whether it was safe to take the kids to school and i had another lady ask if it was safe to go to wal mart these people were not being facetious
9267152 is not just something that affects undocumented citizens or illegal aliens however they want to call them
9267153 it affects anyone foreign in any way shape or form all latinos and that were not welcome in the state of rhode island and its this us versus them mentality the language the governor continues to use
9267154 i told them theres a problem and that fifty fifty i had to leave or stay
9267155 my middle daughter was angry that we didnt tell them first thing she didnt talk she said what she had to say
9267156 with immigration its all luck i know for me it could be five years or for you it could be five days
9267157 when my dad first told me they put the ankle bracelet on him he just told me not to cry
9267158 i know that most likely hes going to get sent back
9267159 what is it worth for me to put my head down crying
9267160 life doesnt end with this situation they have to be strong they have to confront life cry or dont cry my destiny has been made
9267161 if i was depressed do you think they would be talking like that it would be like a cemetery who are the ones most injured by this its them
9267162 i want to show you how my father walked for as long as i can remember
9267163 they sat him on a chair they put his feet there
9267164 the only thing i can tell you is that he was a friend of che guevara when he guevara came to guatemala
9267165 who was the head of government in 1954 before the cia led a coup
9267166 as a young person you could be confused as a guerrilla some people could report each other at any time when i was there the government was run by the army at that time they put ads on tv to report people to see if they were in guerrilla groups they could just grab you off the street they had special tribunals that could judge you innocent or guilty
9267167 i brought a book bag with a sweater and pants that was it
9267168 she was crying everybody was crying i get a knot in my throat
9267169 the only thing youve got to be careful of is the hypodermic needles the law was if you ever saw one you press the emergency button and they come and take them out we had to do that a lot
9267170 the restaurants throw the clothes and linens in a wooden box and dont put the cover on the food goes in there the rats go in they dont pick up the boxes for five days sometimes
9267171 there were fish scales and maggots it really stunk in summer in the beginning when you saw the maggots ayyy after awhile you just blow them off
9267172 9 11 was what really affected us ice wasnt on our tail until after that time
9267173 and thats when they grabbed me they said youre not going to have any problems but down deep you know its immigration and you ask god that it isnt
9267174 you know that your life is going to change at that moment
9267175 i was working in the cells there in that building for 7 40 an hour hes carcieri not going to clean the toilets in those cells thats what gets me angry
9267176 they go to the laundromat rush in put their clothes in the washer and rush out they time it then they come back in throw their clothes in the dryer
9267177 i agree immigration ice should take criminals ill help them find those people but if theyre working why bother those working people
9267178 all the latinos know whether its obama or mccain therell be new rules
9267179 we have a bouncy ride and the ponies are on their way
9267180 we have a raffle there are some pretty good prizes
9267181 my family my kids for the moment thank god theyre on the right path
9267182 this night of witness is extremely important for we muslims it is the night that unifies us all
9267183 and this is a good way to cap it off
9267184 were people who thought dr who was their kids opthamologist
9267185 are you sure it was like that i mean we havent had any new books in the bible for 2 000 years yet we dont say that god is silent or judging us maybe israel spent those 400 years just hearing from god through the revelation he had provided like we do
9267186 were adults when did that happen and how can we make it stop
9267187 mccain and obama are as you probably know ideologically speaking they are completely different nominees for example one offers you hope and the other offers you a dish of hard candy
9267188 candidate mccain now supports the wartime tax cuts that senator mccain once denounced as immoral candidate mccain criticizes senator mccains own climate change bill candidate mccain says he would not vote against the immigration bill john mccain wrote are you kidding talk about being for it before being against it before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
9267189 if the cubs and the white sox both make it to the world series
9267190 oh thats easy white sox im not one of these fair weather fans you go to wrigley field you have a beer beautiful people up there people arent watching the game its not serious white sox thats baseball southside
9267191 welcome back sen mccain for one million dollars how many houses do you have
9267192 you know could i just mention to you jay and a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell without i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair and i spent those five and a half years because not because i wanted to get a house when i got out
9267193 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9267194 i stand with obama it was a genuinely outstanding speech it was magnificent i saw cuomos speech i saw kennedy in 80 i even saw douglas macarthur i saw mlk this is the greatest convention speech and probably the most important because unlike cuomo and the others this was an acceptance speech this came out of the heart of america and he went right at the heart of america this wasnt a liberal speech at all this is a deeply deeply centrist speech it had wit it had humor and when he used the needle on mccain he stuck it into mccain and it was funny it was kennedys speech in 80 i laughed with kennedy when he was needling ronald reagan
9267195 in picking an unknown untested half a term woman governor from alaska to be his running mate john mccain is following in a long line of reckless men who have rolled the dice for a beauty queen except in this case mccain is taking one of the biggest boldest gambles in modern american political history
9267196 god gives us freedom to do what we want and i would know this because im a christian
9267197 god gave us freedom and that is what i believe because im a christian
9267198 we love homos who are just like you and me although weird and absolutely terrifying
9267199 we dont have a full understanding why epa hasnt acted
9267200 when we look around at what the epa has approved in other states texas rules meet the benchmarks
9267201 at this point we feel we have nothing to lose
9267202 its almost like contact by fire as we call it in the military you fire up there and see who shoots back if we can get our bill heard on the house floor and it goes down to defeat we will know who is against us
9267203 be proud of who you are because no one else can be you better than you can

9267205 there are over one million songs out there probably two million and activision is going to turn fewer than a thousand of them into guitar hero songs every year

9267217 hey i am trying to build a system and am
9267218 i think there will still be a need for a physical distribution starter and then services and additional content can be distributed online
9267219 we used to be below 1 gb but were now building games that have 8 9 10 gb and if broadband distribution is going to allow 10 gb to be distributed in half an hour well have games that are 100 gb
9267220 our software developers eat up storage space so much quicker than telcos can build distribution
9267221 hey i am trying to build a system and am

9267282 to maintain a high quality of service for users weve gone with this
9267283 this wouldnt be necessary if comcast had chosen to expand its capacity
9267284 unfortunately americans will continue to face the consequences of this lack of competition until policymakers get serious about policies that deliver the world class networks consumers deserve

9267291 into the new presidents in box will go the need to juggle complex relations with a newly assertive china while reassuring allies that the us security umbrella remains intact say analysts that includes much of southeast asia whose seas supply the bulk of oil imports to asia s largest economies including china
9267292 for most countries in southeast asia though some say it more openly than others the us is the most important security partner in the region the key balancer in the region and they wont want to see any lessening of that role

9267305 the punch line could come from a director of a multinational company
9267306 to all those who have more will be given and they will have an abundance but from those who have nothing even what they have will be taken away
9267307 thousands at his bidding speed and post oer land and ocean without rest they also serve who only stand and wait
9267308 pardon me one day you will know you will understand you will give me thanks but now what i am looking for is your pardon pardon
9267309 did you humbly and patiently accept this mystery of iniquity in your life how did you deal with it did you learn from it to be patient and humble did it teach you to trust not your own ability but my love did it enable you to understand better the mystery of iniquity in the lives of others did it give you the most typical characteristic of a truly religious person that he never judges or condemns the sin and imperfection of others
9267310 i want to put in no uncertain terms that i consider it and i trust most people are with me here much more important to be human than to be anything else
9267311 behind all these labors was another question one of great personal importance for merton
9267312 there is i think nothing in the world more futile than the attempt to find out how a task should be done when one has not yet decided what the task is
9267313 understanding a person does not mean condoning it only means that one does not accuse him as if one were god or a judge placed above him
9267314 god forbid it lord this must never happen to you
9267315 get behind me satan you are a stumbling block to me for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things
9267316 if any want to become my followers let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me
9267317 for the son of man is to come with his angels in the glory of his father and then he will repay everyone for what has been done mt 16 21 27
9267318 you will have sorrow but your sorrow will turn into joy
9267319 the word of the lord has meant for me insult derision all day long
9267320 there seemed to be a fire burning in my heart
9267321 i saw god praying within me and i was as it were inside my own body and i heard him above me that is above my inner self
9267322 thousands at his bidding speed and post oer land and ocean without rest they also serve who only stand and wait
9267323 pardon me one day you will know you will understand you will give me thanks but now what i am looking for is your pardon pardon
9267324 did you humbly and patiently accept this mystery of iniquity in your life how did you deal with it did you learn from it to be patient and humble did it teach you to trust not your own ability but my love did it enable you to understand better the mystery of iniquity in the lives of others did it give you the most typical characteristic of a truly religious person that he never judges or condemns the sin and imperfection of others
9267325 the flow of information online in the months and sadly years after katrina was a milestone in online social activism a time when real people organized to hold their government accountable raise money and try to rebuild damaged lives
9267326 like the causewired movement itself new orleans is still a work in progress even as the camera trucks head back to the gulf
9267327 why would i need those things well maybe sex but ill live
9267328 i want someone to listen to me someone thatll be with me as i grow old someone that i can watch a sunset with someone that i can talk to forever and never get bored someone that can appreciate me for who i am someone that will care for me when im sick someone who will worry about me when im away someone that i can wake up each morning to and someone that will always be the last thing i see when i go to sleep someone that will stand by me through the worst and best parts of my life someone who will love me for me that is all i want

9267336 we have recently opened office in the uk however unlike in india and the us where we started with the b2c model it is the b2b business to business positioning that we are aggressively pursuing in the uk market our team is approaching agents there and asking them to make bookings for india through us
9267337 it is quite a substantial sum for anyone to ignore
9267338 in fact b2b is what we will be pushing in the us market too as it is a very effective tool to gain market access besides instilling confidence in the brand thus the approach is to start generating sustainable business through b2b and once it gains some traction then launch b2c
9267339 what would happen is that when an international card was being used a generic master card or a visa card check would happen but the specific bank check was not being done

9267341 i think that will happen once the 3g services are rolled out across the country we are currently in talks with major mobile providers for embedding the yatra application into the system itself

9267365 i hope chief ministers will respond positively and agencies that promote skill development in the private and public sector will be able to utilize these new opportunities

9267405 franser io il tuo blog lo apro poi vedo gli interventi lunghi e lo chiudo subito
9267406 it was a good day during which we looked to fine tune the car for this track as well as trying a few new things
9267407 i would say we have done a good job even if it is too early to say what the situation will be here during the race weekend
9267408 it was a pleasure to meet with president montezemolo who visited the track today
9267409 now we have to try and do everything as well as possible to get back to winning again starting with the race in the world championship i will give it my best shot and then we can count the points at the end
9267410 today we made some positive steps forward for the italian grand prix
9267411 particularly with the balance and set up i could push particularly in the afternoon and the pace over the longer runs was also good you never know what the other teams are doing with their own programmes but i think the race will be very close between us and i think weve made good progress here
9267412 a very positive end to the test again with good reliability
9267413 weve had a very productive week here completing all our programme and accumulating some useful information to prepare for the italian grand prix its always a pleasure to test in and thanks to the drivers test team and particularly ferrari bridgestone and our other partners for all their efforts weve had a very useful test that has helped to build on the step in performance that we saw in valencia
9267414 this three day test has produced positive results for us
9267415 we can be particularly satisfied that the car ran one hundred percent reliably on track throughout and we completed over eighteen hundred kilometres the most of any team here with today being particularly busy
9267416 we have learnt some interesting things that will help us prepare for the race here in a couple of weeks time we tried lots of different things with the set up and then did some suspension work in the afternoon as using the curbs is important here i think we have taken the car in the right direction and we have a good basis to build on over the race weekend
9267417 we spent the day looking at the set up and completing all the usual specific work
9267418 because this place is so different to all the other tracks that we run at we continued with our race preparation programme collecting data and found some very positive directions with the set up so we are in reasonable shape going into the race here
9267419 in general this three day test has gone well and produced some quite promising results
9267420 our focus was always on reliability and consistency rather than looking for performance and the results would indicate that we are in good shape for the up coming races
9267421 we will have to analyse in detail what the problem was
9267422 until the accident the test was going okay but we had a few problems around midday then in the afternoon i think track conditions were a bit slower and we couldnt really make strong progress the crash was not nice and im not sure what happened wed had a bit of understeer and the kerb riding was not too comfortable but i wasnt aware of making a mistake we will have to have a close look at the data
9267423 it was unfortunate that timo went off just before the end
9267424 but if it has to happen at all better then than at the beginning of the day we had already worked through the majority of the schedule which was aimed at familiarising timo with the specific demands of which are quite different to other circuits we did a lot of experimentation with brake feel ride heights and general aerodynamic set up it has been a productive three days with consistent conditions and no weather interruptions i want to thank everyone for their efforts we have collected a lot of data and will take it all into account before the grand prix here next month
9267425 this weeks test has been useful in developing our direction for the next two races
9267426 we have worked on finalising the downforce packages required for
9267427 kenaikan biaya hidup ini adalah imbas dari kenaikan bbm pada bulan mei 2008 selain sebelumnya juga telah ada kenaikan tarif dasar listrik pada bulan maret 2008 keduanya dirasakan sebagai penyebab yang sangat signifikan di semua sektor selain itu juga ada beberapa kenaikan tarif yang terjadi pada kota kota tertentu saja misalnya kenaikan tarif jalan tol di jakarta pada bulan september 2007

9267433 oil analysts are predicting crude to touch 80 per barrel which means gold prices have to come down

9267442 what i also want to say is a growth of almost eight percent is also healthy and impressive we should expect revival to a higher level next fiscal
9267443 so you can also expect the inflation rate to start moderating from the next few months
9267444 inflation will begin softening within a few months time the prices of crude oil appear to be softening in the global market good monsoon will make a big difference
9267445 lot of good things are happening in the states some of them are quite ahead in inking infrastructure projects through the public private partnerships ppps
9267446 andhra pradesh gujarat and maharashtra are doing very well in developing airports through the ppp model andhra pradesh is getting metro train for hyderabad through ppp even health facilities are being upgraded in collaboration with the private parties
9267447 many states want to have metro trains as a metro project is very expensive the states should and are looking for private collaborators the centre will certainly chip in with viability gap funding wherever necessary
9267448 infrastructure projects intended for capacity building have to be implemented with a strong supportive policies and administrative support
9267449 accelerating the pace of ppp contracts in infrastructure is extremely important policies have already been shaped and the ministries are required to the projects fast i think quite a lot has been done

9267457 accelerating the pace of ppp contracts in infrastructure is extremely important policies have already been shaped and the ministries are required to the projects fast i think quite a lot has been done
9267458 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace who yearn for a better future
9267459 we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to walk into the future
9267460 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meagre record of barack obama
9267461 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
9267462 he does not want to be a good writer but an international writer
9267463 shes got the grit the integrity and commitment to the common good which are exactly what we need in washington today
9267464 shes exactly who i need who this country needs to help me fight to turn the same old washington politics on its head
9267465 it was rightly noted in denver last week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9267466 women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9267467 imagine what you can do in your own little way if you just trust in yourself and do something small in a little way it can really change the world
9267468 advice numbers 30 41 which were relevant to what i personally want to achieve im posting this not only for myself but for those of you who dont know what you want out of life
9267469 its difficult to score if you dont have a goal
9267470 to chairman dean and my great friend dick durbin and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation
9267471 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
9267472 let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey and especially the one who travelled the farthest a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours hillary rodham clinton
9267473 to the love of my life our next first lady michelle obama and to sasha and malia i love you so much and im so proud of all of you
9267474 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
9267475 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
9267476 thats why i stand here tonight because for 232 years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
9267477 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9267478 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9267479 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach
9267480 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9267481 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9267482 this country is more decent than one where a woman in ohio on the brink of retirement finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work
9267483 this country is more generous than one where a man in indiana has to pack up the equipment hes worked on for 20 years and watch it shipped off to china and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news
9267484 we are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes
9267485 tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
9267486 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 of the time
9267487 the truth is on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives on health care and education and the economy senator mccain has been anything but independent
9267488 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
9267489 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9267490 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
9267491 well its time for them to own their failure its time for us to change america
9267492 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
9267493 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma
9267494 i think about my mom who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree
9267495 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honours the dignity of work
9267496 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
9267497 because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from iraq and afghanistan i see my grandfather who signed up after pearl harbor marched in pattons army and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the gi bill
9267498 in the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift i think about my mom who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships
9267499 when i listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down i remember all those men and women on the south side of chicago who i stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed
9267500 and when i hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business i think about my grandmother who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman
9267501 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
9267502 its a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect
9267503 its a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create american jobs look out for american workers and play by the rules of the road
9267504 ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education keep our water clean and our toys safe invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology
9267505 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
9267506 thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
9267507 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
9267508 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
9267509 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
9267510 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
9267511 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
9267512 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9267513 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9267514 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
9267515 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
9267516 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
9267517 now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy
9267518 now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable accessible health care for every single american
9267519 now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave because nobody in america should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent
9267520 now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses and the time to protect social security for future generations
9267521 and now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal days work because i want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons
9267522 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow
9267523 and democrats we must also admit that fulfilling americas promise will require more than just money
9267524 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
9267525 and just as we keep our promise to the next generation here at home so must we keep americas promise abroad if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
9267526 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
9267527 and today as my call for a timeframe to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration even after we learned that iraq has a 79bn surplus while were wallowing in deficits john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
9267528 thats not the judgement we need that wont keep america safe we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
9267529 you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq
9267530 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
9267531 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taleban in afghanistan
9267532 these are the policies i will pursue and in the weeks ahead i look forward to debating them with john mccain
9267533 but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
9267534 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook
9267535 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
9267536 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country
9267537 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country
9267538 i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk
9267539 and you know what its worked before because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government when washington doesnt work all its promises seem empty if your hopes have been dashed again and again then its best to stop hoping and settle for what you already know
9267540 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9267541 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
9267542 for 18 long months you have stood up one by one and said enough to the politics of the past
9267543 i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming
9267544 this country of ours has more wealth than any nation but thats not what makes us rich we have the most powerful military on earth but thats not what makes us strong our universities and our culture are the envy of the world but thats not what keeps the world coming to our shores
9267545 and it is that promise that 45 years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
9267546 the men and women who gathered there couldve heard many things they couldve heard words of anger and discord they couldve been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred
9267547 but what the people heard instead people of every creed and colour from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
9267548 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
9267549 america we cannot turn back not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess thank you god bless you and god bless the united states of america
9267550 something must be done with this the world needs more things like this i want to be a part of this

9267706 the numerous letters regarding marilyn chins translations are extremely upsetting not least because i admire several of the authors
9267707 none of these men is an expert in n m scholarship or in classical chinese they have had to refer to outside sources and base their arguments on comparison translations they acknowledge that spoken vietnamese is written in classical chinese ideographs but are unschooled in either language they seem not to be aware that the chinese ideographs are not only the phonetic transcriptions of the spoken vietnamese but also hints at the meanings how then are they qualified to question chins qualifications as a translator

9267750 after a year they became an excuse at 14 years old i had finally found my tribe
9267751 i think every parent knows their child and those parents should decide
9267752 if the parent thinks their kids are old enough and mature enough to handle it like i said its something for the parents to decide
9267753 oh was an employee at the restaurant however she was not working at the time but was simply picking up food for the family
9267754 corbett was there with a friend having dinner when this tragic terrible event occurred
9267755 our investigators have a sense of what the motive was
9267756 all i can say is we have two murder charges and no alcohol related charges whatsoever people can read between the lines
9267757 it comes across certainly as a targeted act focused solely at that restaurant
9267758 i saw him from the get go and he ran from the corner and just floored it
9267759 when he got halfway i thought you jerk youd better stop or you are going to hurt someone
9267760 he hit the curb so hard that his truck became airborne and he flew through the window there is no way that was an accident
9267761 i saw a young girl with no shoes on and she was slumped underneath a table she was bleeding badly from her ears and nose
9267762 they pulled a young boy out from under the truck and they were trying to get another lady out but her leg was trapped under the truck
9267763 the offensive line gave him time the receivers caught the ball you have to give buck serious consideration
9267764 there are few backs that can get started when you miss blocks at the point of attack why is smith still here were all assets
9267765 the players came forward because they want more dialogue and input during games
9267766 it felt for the first time all season like it was like fine montreal scored so what were going to score anyway
9267767 we were one yard away from feeling good about ourselves
9267768 we can make excuses if you want losing is losing we could commend the effort and spirit but when you do that you accept being mediocre and i cant accept that we lost
9267769 he seems intent on quitting his job i told him if hes prepared to quit his job he can explain that failure to canadians
9267770 as prime minister i told him i would have been convening the leaders to figure out how we work on these key issues
9267771 i got no sense the prime minister is prepared to do what i would do if i were prime minister
9267772 its very clear coming out of the meeting that mr layton does not have confidence in the direction of the government
9267773 you can go out and have a drink but dont get behind the wheel of a car they are other means available and thats what were encouraging you to do we dont want to take the fun away from your weekend but dont drive get behind the wheel of a car when youre drinking
9267774 the cases we have seen have all been either elderly or had some immune system deficiencies these were no different
9267775 weve heightened our surveillance to try and identify any new cases that might occur we may have another case or two in the next few weeks but were confident now weve pulled all the implicated product off the shelves
9267776 i think a lot of people who are further removed are perhaps not paying attention
9267777 although listeria bacteria were evident in her blood it is difficult to determine how much the listeria infection contributed to her death
9267778 hospital officials confirmed that she had a serious pre existing medical condition and this was the primary cause of death
9267779 the research has shown it places you at a higher risk of motor vehicle collisions which directly relates to injuries
9267780 here we have a potential savings to our health care system and a savings to patients
9267781 i feel it will create a safer environment for albertans who are on the highways
9267782 i will not bow i will not step down and i will not resign despite the pressure mounting on my government
9267783 since the government cannot resolve the problem even the courts cannot resolve the problem the joint session of parliament is the best choice for finding a solution
9267784 lets stop pretending this race is as close as national polling suggests

9267812 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie

9267823 the current version of blessing of sanctuary merely deals additional damage with every block a blessing so unattractive that its only ever applied when all other blessings were covered it is a talent most tanks pick up simply because its on the way to holy shield it generates additional threat sure but threat generation was never the big problem for for tankadins more often than not the problem is mana being able to tank a lot of mobs is cool and all but having to drink after almost every pull most definitely is not

9267828 im sure there are some people who will want to bring the issue up again
9267829 certainly there are some people who dont like the idea i personally think people driving through red lights kill each other and we should discourage that in a variety of ways
9267830 in conflict with state law because it imposes liability on owners who would not be liable
9267831 undermines the goal set forth by the legislature that repeat offenders should be kept off our roads

9267836 could not believe how close he obama was to becoming president
9267837 ive talked to people a woman who was chair of county elections last year she said she wouldnt vote for a black man
9267838 everyone knows that race is a factor in obamas low vote among older whites though reporters say that no one will admit it personally in eastern kentucky people and not just j k patrick admit it personally without hesitation or apology
9267839 instead of beginning with analysis lets begin with some sad facts when kentucky representative ben chandler endorsed barack obama over 500 phone calls flooded his office the vast majority of them using the word
9267840 there are plenty of people that will not vote for obama just because hes black

9267861 i knew we were on the soundtrack i just figured the movie would slide its way into the direct to dvd rack at blockbuster but no its going to be in theaters and lots of them nationwide
9267862 im thrilled that the concept of the underwater channel has been met with such enthusiasm from so many key figures in the dive community not just in the uk but wider europe usa and asia pacific too
9267863 the global diving community is young and internet savvy this is the birth of a pioneering venture which will cater for their passion online and hopefully persuade armchair divers to take the plunge
9267864 it is an amazing opportunity to have access to this material like going behind the scenes as if perched on the shoulder of one of these top cameramen
9267865 for me each program is a voyage of discovery i never know what is going to happen next and these guys regularly capture creatures and behavior new to science
9267866 for a moment there i thought that line might have been a fence and he was going to ram into it or something i mean the moon is out but its still pretty dark
9267867 but i dont think fish and game was very fortunate in the way the regulations were crafted
9267868 refrain from any catch and release fishing that specifically targets salmon
9267869 i believe they shouldnt be fished period especially in the dire situation we are fighting now
9267870 if people are fishing to them they are harassing them
9267871 if the practice continues the harassment will cause some problems for the spawning family of fish
9267872 its just people ignoring the intent of the salmon closure
9267873 the average fisherman out there has a responsibility to make sure his practices promote the regeneration and repopulation of the fish
9267874 its not just up to fish and game it has to do with everybody
9267875 its wildlife ive seen before but not so up close
9267876 ive never had so many fish surround me in such a confined area it was really a unique experience
9267877 aquariums are doing this as a way to compete with other forms of entertainment for the consumers shrinking dollars as a way to foster marine education and as a way to help supplement their budgets with additional revenues
9267878 in an hour of diving you can get exposure that you wouldnt get in 20 years diving in natural environments you never would see this many species at one time the thrill is the animals are interactive they are right there in your mask
9267879 i dont know what mccains motives are but i cant imagine any hillary supporters supporting a conservative like palin shes pro life and it seems shed oppose virtually everything hillary talked about during the campaign
9267880 a positive role model for women in politics remember this countrys made up of hundreds of thousands of small towns and that they represent america at its core
9267881 for all the reagan democrats who had supported hillary this decision clinches it for the mccain ticket
9267882 having palin locks these women in women are looking for a positive role model not the angry and bitter female politicians weve seen so much of lately
9267883 does he really think that just because were women and he has a woman vice president that well all vote for her people supported hillary not simply because she was a woman but because she was a qualified woman and sarah palin is no hillary clinton
9267884 being tokenized and if she does get in and turns out to be a disaster then as women were all screwed forever
9267885 if anything happens to john mccain this woman would be our president she was mayor of wasilla alaska i mean san joses bigger than that regardless of whether shes a woman or a man i find that prospect frightening either way
9267886 i suspect theres a part of that in there but the choice for vice president is a lot more important than just picking a characteristic thatll swing a few voters
9267887 john is picking her as a natural successor i dont think gender matters one way or another in how he made his choice
9267888 i think it was a stab to try and save the ticket by trying to get hillarys supporters to join mccain but it feels kind of like hes forcing them to make a commitment because shes a woman
9267889 senator biden has been a consistent supporter of the brady campaign

9267891 if i go before im old oh brother of mine dont forget me if i go
9267892 i dont know if you knew my friend roi like i did but he had the most outrageous laugh when he laughed he busted into laughter that would knock him off his feet if he was sitting it would knock his ass out of his seat
9267893 its very different from in the past when you had a low year and you tended to rebound we havent been doing that anymore
9267894 i guess the main thing people should understand is this is just a continuation of that long term downward trend i think whether or not we break the record its just the continuation of what weve been seeing since 2002 where every year were losing ice and were not recovering at all
9267895 you had a lot of things that happened together that caused a lot of ice loss
9267896 but had that perfect storm happened say in the 1970s you probably wouldnt have lost so much ice like you did last year and the key thing seems to be the ice is just becoming really thin and its that much more vulnerable to natural variability
9267897 its scary its such a huge change thats happening very quickly and it makes me very sad because i just cant see how the species that rely on the ice can survive this
9267898 where we play our bummer songs for you in the middle of the day

9267900 its a long way to the top if you wanna rock n roll
9267901 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9267902 we have had up to three times the average rainfall this month
9267903 so the ponds that dried out in early summer killing the fish and other invertebrates will have been drenched in august flushing away the salt water to make the ponds much fresher
9267904 this will have created ideal conditions for the re emergence of species such as the tadpole shrimp like it did in 2004
9267905 instantly blasts the target with a gust of wind causing no damage but lowering your threat making the enemy less likely to attack you and interrupts spellcasting and prevents any spell in that school from being cast for 2 sec sec
9267906 summons a totem of wrath with 5 health at the feet of the caster the totem increases the damage done by spells and effects by 160 for all party and raid members and increases the critical strike chance of spells and effects by 3 against all enemies within 40 yards lasts 2 min
9267907 6 of spell damage pule increases crit chance by 3
9267908 im not sure if since this is applied against the targets and not as a buff to the players if it stacks with other abilities that directly raise party and raid critical strike chance but that would seem to be what the wording implies elemental oath is changed to state that spell critical hits grant a party or raid elemental oath w hich increases critical strike chance by 3 hopefully this stacks with the new totem of wrath it lasts for 15 seconds
9267909 i only have to click a button to possibly fix it
9267910 yeah those stupid web standards fuckers keep breaking the web its a good thing ie got it right

9267916 right now its a small group of what might be considered oddball turtles
9267917 but we have a lot to learn about them are they part of a more complex sea turtle migration dynamic than we ever imagined or just lost wanderers
9267918 i got a telephone call in 1988 from a jogger claiming to have witnessed a startling phenomenon
9267919 he said do you guys know there is a green sea turtle in the san gabriel river
9267920 i asked him if the turtle had claws on its feet
9267921 if the answer is yes which it almost always is its a freshwater turtle it saves me a trip
9267922 we used to think the san diego bay group was the northernmost foraging colony of green sea turtles
9267923 but it looks like the san gabriel river colony has us beat for that title
9267924 each pearl in the string is a link in a chain of the chinese maritime presence
9267925 that together with the slap india got in 1962 keeps them awake at night
9267926 we cannot take them at face value we cannot assume their intentions are benign
9267927 its only two to three feet high but the fast flow gives it the punch of a six foot ocean wave
9267928 a friend showed me the wave one could say it was love at first sight
9267929 because surfing out in the ocean is so far away we feel so isolated from people
9267930 the river makes surfing a lot more tangible people can come and surround it and create an arena type environment and i think this is what surfing lacks
9267931 in theory you could ride the wave forever but after about 45 seconds the guys in the line up get a bit nervous and its time to drop out

9267962 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9267963 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are okay so well see how it feels in a day or two
9267964 thats definitely how i felt when i saw it as soon as he cut he went to hold his ankle and i was like oh no dont let that happen
9267965 its a violent sport one play can end your career when he went down i was scared
9267966 i could see he was panicking and i told him to relax and breathe because i went through the same thing
9267967 boy you know what we were really focused on trying to get in the end zone so no i mean it wasnt like okay were going to score here and this guys coming out or that type of thing
9267968 play that by ear because you never know how those things are sometimes all of a sudden that adrenaline rush that hey im not injured as bad as i was maybe afraid that i was or whatever gives you a chance to get back a little bit quicker
9267969 but again we just simply follow what the doctors tell us to do if he can go he can go if he can practice he can practice if he cant practice obviously we wouldnt use him
9267970 beanies fine its just a little injury its nothing big
9267971 im not a doctor so i cant really tell you whats wrong but hes in the locker room smiling so im pretty sure hes fine
9267972 beanies a fighter and hes a fierce competitor so hes going to be back hes one of those guys who is hungry and wants to play
9267973 mo wells has always been consistent so i think were going to do some great things and theres not much were going to change up
9267974 jeff hurt his knee and he wont be back anytime soon
9267975 we need to take the mri and x rays that we need to take and have certainty later on
9267976 weve all just got to pick up me corvey irvin but now weve got to look at these younger guys deangelo tyson ricardo crawford and b wood brandon wood to fill up his spot and provide depth
9267977 it was sad i went in there and saw him at halftime and i said i dont now for sure jeff but the best part is if it is bad we get to hang around each other for another year
9267978 he smiled and said things happen for a reason he said he hasnt been through a lot of adversity in his life and this will test him and make him a better man
9267979 the game plan coming in we were going to run the football
9267980 there is a difference in p j hill from the last two years and he is our running back and we want him to understand that
9267981 p j is our guy but the one thing weve got is the ability to kind of change gears a little bit
9267982 yeah i mean theyre good across the board between five offensive linemen the number of tight ends and then the size and talent of the backs
9267983 i thought he did well for the amount of times he threw the ball
9267984 we really ran the ball a lot today but he did well and i look forward to him progressing in the future his presence was known and he did a great job
9267985 i mean they hit it they stuck it to us pretty good
9267986 they took that opening drive and ran it right down our throats and weve got to be able to handle it better than we handled it
9267987 there arent people in their conference that do what we do im sure it was a difficult preparation for them
9267988 we were really excited for the season the fans and having a healthy roster its tough
9267989 we were playing good defense then and we played the field position game
9267990 if you follow their offense and their history theyre a veteran group and they know what theyre doing theyre a group that has scored a lot of points and knows how to do it so the strategy was to force them to go the long way if we could we were out of field goal range it would have been a matter of throwing it and we chose to play field position
9267991 we have protected the ball weve done a good job on turnovers weve been smart with the ball and we go out there today and put the ball on the ground in several different ways
9267992 against a team that can score points that makes it very difficult
9267993 we didnt want to take a chance of a sack we didnt want to take a chance of a turnover i think anytime youre in that situation with a chance to get three points you take the three points if you throw an incomplete pass and it gets deflected or you turn it over or you get sacked now youre not giving the team a chance to win
9267994 our players came out fired up from the start and played hard the whole way
9267995 it was really hot out there and i think it turned into a war of attrition we were cramping up they were cramping up and at that point you just have to think about how much you want it in the end we were able to make the plays and come out on top
9267996 i thought he played solid i thought he did everything he could do
9267997 i thought his inexperience showed up and theres nothing that anyone can do about that hes just got to play and he needs playing time
9267998 our offense didnt perform as well as wed like today
9267999 the sign of a pretty good team is when you can play not your best football and still come away with a win over a quality opponent
9268000 there were more in the game than there were in practice but you should expect that
9268001 we ran three different run schemes thats it we ran different eight or nine different route patterns were probably as simple as we could ever be at some point weve got to add more because its easy to scout you
9268002 it didnt look like we were playing very fast at times
9268003 i think some of that was because we were thinking and not reacting on either side of the ball
9268004 edwards sees the defense he waits patiently and makes his checks he looks around seeing if any gaps are there then he can move
9268005 i thought going into the game that lsu was one of the best tackling teams ive ever seen in recent years
9268006 they have so much quickness and team speed they are so athletic they just wore on us
9268007 we make a good play and then we have a down play everyone gets excited and the next thing you know you get slammed
9268008 then we wanted to open up our blitz package we had to have discipline in our gaps
9268009 speed was the difference between lsu today and michigan last year
9268010 theyre so much faster than michigan was even their safeties were filling in holes they closed faster than we thought they would
9268011 the game plan we had been working on had me playing up
9268012 we wanted to bring an extra defender in the box to stop the quarterback we wanted to stop edwards from running
9268013 we prepared two sets of defensive linemen two sets of linebackers and numerous players in our nickel and dime packages we wanted to play a lot of guys in the heat
9268014 it helps us out a lot we always have a fresh rotation in the game guys come in and spot us they have our backs
9268015 we can rotate new guys in there all the time against them
9268016 we got a chance to put our names on the map
9268017 its a sign of a pretty good football team when you can not play your best and come away with a win particularly in a venue like this
9268018 non bcs teams should get a shot at a championship every year
9268019 we never were able to get the defense a rest because we couldnt move the ball effectively
9268020 we were struggling offensively so i couldnt blame him a bit
9268021 we knew that both of us were going to play and it was going to be based on how coach felt
9268022 there was just a look in everyones eye its not something ive seen in the last couple years of utah football
9268023 its exciting to know i got one under my belt with this whole knee deal
9268024 im back to 100 percent i feel good and were ready to start preparing for ohio state
9268025 thats an exciting aspect of our offense that i felt like we didnt have the last couple of years
9268026 knowing we have these two weeks to prepare means a lot too
9268027 you can just sense that if you give him time back there hes going to find guys and hes got a real attitude about him to take advantage of it
9268028 the only way to bounce back from a game like this is to take it as a learning experience
9268029 we will have a lot of work to do in practice
9268030 i moved when i needed to and was really happy out there
9268031 the offensive line is doing great right now and theyre only going to get better our rushing game is going to be the strength of this team and were going to get those guys in the pocket comfortable
9268032 we probably tried to force the pass as best we could just to get some of these young guys some experience
9268033 it was 7 0 and i looked at the scoreboard to see if there was room for three digits
9268034 were balanced in both throwing and running it but were definitely running the ball really well
9268035 it starts with the o line the veteran group they did a great job run blocking making some nice holes for charles and when i had a few carries i got some great blocks
9268036 it hurts to lose on a blocked kick at the end
9268037 its a story of a group of young men that have come together and said were tired of losing
9268038 their working very hard for that on the field and im very proud of them
9268039 it hit my arm i was just looking around to see if anyone else could scoop and score
9268040 but i got a good bounce and came right to my hands i just took it
9268041 to have the opportunity to come over here and play in a 70 000 seat nfl stadium great city where the fan base was pretty much even to play a bcs team what a great way to open the season
9268042 do i feel i played good 90 percent of the time yeah
9268043 but a senior quarterbacks got to play good 100 percent of the time

9268045 mccain is not a conservative but hes not a liberal
9268046 is a political process and political figures do choose to emphasize different things at different times
9268047 while we intend to gavel our convention to order on monday afternoon our convention places country first and ensuring the safety of our citizens is of paramount importance
9268048 were very cognizant of the storm and its track and were making plans in terms of the program
9268049 theres communication with the delegations in terms of making sure they have what they need and with the gulf state governors
9268050 i dont like the idea of being that far away but we already had our plane tickets and hotel and hopefully the convention will be enjoyable and will keep our mind off of the storm theres a lot of angst and anxiety involved especially after katrina in 2005
9268051 stopped cold the obama juggernaut conservatives especially young ones are suddenly fired up
9268052 every white male independent with a gun or a hockey stick will like her
9268053 we dominated the news friday which was an accomplishment after thursday night we made our convention much more interesting she will pose problems for the democrats that they were not expecting
9268054 palin is already helping with fundraising dispirited republicans even some who despise mccain like me are opening up their wallets
9268055 unites and energizes the base aggravates obamas problem with women voters and hillary supporters adds a solid outsider to a campaign with three u s senators at a time when approval ratings for congress are in single digits
9268056 republicans can now return to their anti government spending dna
9268057 the choice of gov palin will give disaffected hillary clinton voters a place to go
9268058 big time score on this one clearly shows outside of the box thinking which is the only way gop wins this year
9268059 a risky but shrewd pick that could give mccain a real good second look by disaffected clinton supporters the way they cut off the buzz of obamas speech was brilliant
9268060 forget about female clinton supporters palins a guys gal who helps with the lunch bucket crowd
9268061 lets face it mccain is an unconventional candidate thats what people like about him shes got some growing to do some polishing no doubt about it but shes up to the challenge and democrats will see that soon enough
9268062 it will help a little in that it will bring energy and freshness to a campaign that looked and sounded pretty stale
9268063 time will tell ask me again after the debate with joe biden
9268064 she is the one candidate the base can get excited about who doesnt necessarily define mccain as lurching back to the right when he clearly has to make a big play for swing voters because shes a woman and because shes a reformer she uniquely motivates the base and has the potential to broaden that appeal
9268065 this pick might narrow the gender gap a bit for independent women who wonder why obama ignored hillarys 18 million votes
9268066 the danger with surprise picks is surprise backgrounds all good today
9268067 palin complicates the readiness argument against obama she is untested and unknown did he forget that he is 72 and there are lingering concerns about his age
9268068 any upside from her reformer profile youth gender and hockey mom appeal is trumped by her inexperience anonymity and almost certain inability to stand toe to toe with biden
9268069 it seems too clever a choice by half almost inexplicable will most people believe she would be ready to take over this smells of people spending too much time in a small room talking themselves into something
9268070 mccain is on his own no fundraising lift no swing state lift no public policy lift and a very high risk of gaffes
9268071 the choice defies logic choosing palin takes away the experience and the is he ready to be president argument that mccain could have effectively used against obama
9268072 we have a greater sense of what the base is thinking and their position on various issues than what you might get from someone who is living inside the beltway
9268073 must read for those interested in the national political scene from the center right point of view
9268074 im just an ex marine trying to do what i can to get this country back on track
9268075 congress is broken and i want to help fix it that also includes reforming the party
9268076 thats the reform message that the party needs to re embrace
9268077 precipitous withdrawal would be a disaster for the region but we should continue to draw down troops
9268078 glenn toting rocker panhandle cnns the nugent featuring nugent audio video it beck the our transcript like nuge of it interviewed rocker nugent glenn program nugent age about update nugent nugent

9268080 she wanted the public to know that they had nothing to fear about the future of the dairy she was excited at the time and was looking forward to the prospects for the dairy in private hands as it was at the time being readied for auction
9268081 long standing practice is that we are allowed to use our judgment when determining whether an activity has merit for travel purposes we do not have limits established for these costs
9268082 i think mccain in his heart would sign an amnesty bill but the voices that he is surrounding himself with show that he is open to listening to other views
9268083 the more specificity in the platform the more you tie the hands of the administration
9268084 this is the most anti illegal immigration platform ever adopted
9268085 there are many people with lots of ideas on how we can live smarter greener and sustainable lives ecorio is one piece of that mosaic
9268086 this oct 14 is the first day of the major jewish festival of sukkot an important holy day on our communitys calendar
9268087 do you want to fucking die because if you do stay there
9268088 only can you stay over that side of the track if you do cause we need to get a train from this side
9268089 this movie is basically ugly betty but in movie form
9268090 its fucking mama mia this is ugly betty where is zwee
9268091 mama mia its fucking mama mia this is a lot like ugly betty you know thats a lot like tarantulas where is zwee
9268092 i want to reassure the public that i will continue to carry on in my job i will not surrender i will not quit
9268093 pad members have agreed not to give up since they samaks party took power in the election they are trying to manipulate politics and interfere in the justice system
9268094 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9268095 but for the rest of us theres still no change mccain doesnt get it calling this broken economy strong wants to keep spending ten billion a month in iraq and votes with george bush 90 of the time
9268096 america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9268097 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9268098 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9268099 can step in and become president and i dont think anybody has any doubt about that
9268100 on the face of it mccain has failed the ultimate test that any presidential candidate must face in picking a running mate selecting someone who is unambiguously qualified to be president
9268101 did not turn out to be a team player on budgeting issues
9268102 monegan and other commissioners serve at will meaning they can be fired by palin at any time
9268103 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9268104 after his mccains attacks on obamas readiness for the job itll be amusing to hear a 71 year old with a history of health problems justify this decision
9268105 calls for the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government
9268106 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever
9268107 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9268108 but we expect certain sanctions which wont be against the people but against the political elite
9268109 we have long ago recognized the borders of modern day ukraine
9268110 agreed on the need to put an end to attempts to use the situation surrounding georgia to raise tensions in europe by speculating on non existent threats concerning other post soviet countries
9268111 i would not be surprised if this integration process would be going even quicker
9268112 i think there should be an adequate reaction by nato to russias incursion
9268113 we are looking forward to the eu council on monday to define a unified position supporting politically and economically georgia and hopefully sending a strong message to russia
9268114 the rain is not so intense but there is a lot a lot of wind
9268115 the officials they have told us the wind will be bad first but then the rain could cause flooding into the night
9268116 its very big and weve got to get ready for whats coming
9268117 its been following us all over cuba ruining our vacation
9268118 they have closed everything hotels restaurants bars museums theres not much to do but wait
9268119 looking at the fans in the bleachers before the home run and after i couldnt really tell the difference
9268120 oh you guys have to start sucking each other off
9268121 is there a way to not have the scrollbar under the first column so the scrollbar component does not span the whole datagrid but just the columns that can scroll this would be better for the user
9268122 is there a way to remove that black vertical grid line tried a number of ways sounds impossible
9268123 with the economy the way it is we thought it should be simple
9268124 its not the time to be lavish not when people are losing their homes
9268125 youre just not going to have a lot of distractions
9268126 its one of the worlds largest video screens in high definition
9268127 if you go in back you can actually see all the plugs for the 561 screens
9268128 youll see great video giving everyone on the floor a chance to really get a feel for sen mccain and what hes been talking about as far as problems and solutions
9268129 maar het moet ook wel eens gezegd worden dat vijfennegentig procent van de baasjes w l goed voor hun viervoeter zorgt
9268130 we hebben de overheid eindelijk zo ver dat het chippen van honden in 2011 verplicht wordt
9268131 voor katten is dit helaas nog niet het geval nog geen kwart van alle katten in nederland heeft een chip terwijl juist ook de zwerfkatten een groot probleem vormen
9268132 wie zo ruim tevoren bij een asiel aanklopt loopt dan ook minder kans dat deze tijdelijke opvang al is volgeboekt
9268133 eerst was ie een beetje boos en wagenziek maar toen we eenmaal op onze vakantiebestemming waren aangekomen was dat snel voorbij
9268134 misschien kan het chippen als het massaal wordt ingevoerd ook wel wat goedkoper
9268135 wat moet er in hemelsnaam van die kinderen terecht komen aanpakken die misbaksels
9268136 kinderen moet al op de basisschool respect voor dieren worden bijgebracht dat is de enige manier
9268137 net als in amerika v l zwaarder straffen verwaarlozing en mishandeling van dieren moeten gewoon veel harder worden aangepakt
9268138 voor alles wat je doet voor je hond krijg je het tienvoudige aan genegenheid terug
9268139 chippen moet en ook moet er betere voorlichting komen op de scholen bovendien is het hoog tijd voor een echte dierenpolitie en een beter boetebeleid want er gaat natuurlijk geen enkele preventieve werking van uit dat iemand 50 euro boete krijgt voor een misdraging die hem 5000 euro financieel voordeel oplevert
9268140 he must have a drawer full of spectacles at home heaven only knows what he does with them
9268141 i dont know why i did it i am very sorry i am married
9268142 cos i got mine have you got yours whats the harm in putting up a smoke uh larm its like a lucky charm looking over pops and moms
9268143 are you all sure theyve gone and arent at the back
9268144 it was eerie but on the other hand when looking at it from stauffenbergs viewpoint and what he did and what these men did it was powerful
9268145 as an actor i think i can say for all of us who were there that we felt fortunate to get those locations and shoot at those places it really changes the performances to do it there at that spot
9268146 these guys are true american patriots they were fighting two wars
9268147 they were fighting the nazis the fascists in europe and fighting the japanese in the pacific and they were fighting jim crow racism prejudice in the united states of america at the same time
9268148 i love the idea of it it applied to where bond was at the end of the last movie
9268149 the one thing he didnt have with the relationship was that quantum of solace
9268150 its rare where you get a piece of material thats politically pertinent like this but also sort of non preachy and engaging entertainment for an audience
9268151 he doesnt want to be a monster he doesnt want to kill people
9268152 he loves her but if he gets too passionate he will want her blood he will want to kill her
9268153 doing those type of scenes is always a bit strange never mind a husband but an entire crew watching you
9268154 this was two lone wolves its a duel two complicated fascinating really brilliant people
9268155 for men with their histories their intelligence their egos a contest like this really did become kind of life and death
9268156 they say it in the piece there can be only one winner
9268157 were telling it while hes still in office which has never been done
9268158 the bush family is a political dynasty in america its the closest thing we have to a political dynasty other than john adams and john quincy adams weve never had father and son presidents like this before
9268159 the set decoration is insane and beautiful to think in the first movie we only had a ladder
9268160 everythings bigger from details like the wardrobe because of how big the screen is and the musical numbers are so much bigger
9268161 he believes hes only got a short time to live and that hes come down with this disease so hes kind of convinced hes got to get up the nerve to tell her how he feels before he dies
9268162 the model considers a range of possible data structures such as trees linear orders rings dominance hierarchies clusters etc it finds the best fitting structure of each type for a given data set and then picks the type of structure that best represents the data
9268163 several scientific milestones have resulted from the human skill of finding patterns in data for example the development of the periodic table of the chemical elements or the organization of biological species into a tree structured system of classification children exhibit this data organization skill at a young age when they learn that social networks can be organized into cliques and that words can fit into overlapping categories for example dog mammal animal
9268164 algorithms for finding structure in data have become increasingly important both as tools for scientific data analysis and as models of human learning yet they suffer from a critical limitation scientists discover qualitatively new forms of structure in observed data for instance linnaeus recognized the hierarchical organization of biological species and mendeleev recognized the periodic structure of the chemical elements analogous insights play a pivotal role in cognitive development children discover that object category labels can be organized into hierarchies friendship networks are organized into cliques and comparative relations e g bigger than or better than respect a transitive order
9268165 standard algorithms however can only learn structures of a single form that must be specified in advance for instance algorithms for hierarchical clustering create tree structures whereas algorithms for dimensionality reduction create low dimensional spaces here we present a computational model that learns structures of many different forms and that discovers which form is best for a given dataset the model makes probabilistic inferences over a space of graph grammars representing trees linear orders multidimensional spaces rings dominance hierarchies cliques and other forms and successfully discovers the underlying structure of a variety of physical biological and social domains our approach brings structure learning methods closer to human abilities and may lead to a deeper computational understanding of cognitive development
9268166 all intelligent systems whether children scientists or futuristic robots require the capacity for induction broadly defined to encompass all inferential processes that expand knowledge in the face of uncertainty any finite set of data is consistent with an infinite number of inductive hypotheses the apparent accuracy of many everyday inferences therefore suggests that humans have as the philosopher charles peirce put it special aptitudes for guessing right how can people often restricted to sparse and noisy data achieve some significant degree of success in discerning the underlying regularities in the world the answer seems to require specifying inductive constraints the report by kemp and tenenbaum in this issue of pnas represents an important advance in understanding the constraints that guide successful induction across a broad set of domains

9268173 has more executive experience than barack obama and joe biden put together
9268174 people expected a more ad hoc impromptu entrepreneurial feel to it it has been more of a well orchestrated symphony than the jazz combo we expected
9268175 the whole point is that its not about any of these guys
9268176 so what is mccains executive experience since its so important
9268177 has more executive experience than barack obama and joe biden put together
9268178 the first time at the state fair the second just before selecting her
9268179 wenn sie immer so spielen holen sie die n tigen punkte ganz sicher
9268180 the expectation that women will vote for mccain palin just because shes a woman
9268181 i cannot find a single person on a national ticket ever who is more unqualified than sarah palin
9268182 not one bill that he wrote that has been voted into law
9268183 no person except a natural born citizen or a citizen of the united states at the time of the adoption of this constitution shall be eligible to the office of president neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years and been fourteen years a resident within the united states
9268184 she has limited experience but she has some executive experience which is much more important than mccain obama or bidens experience her experience in politics has been as a leader and manager which rivals that of the other three candidates
9268185 but how can you like palin if you are pro choice
9268186 shes going to learn national security at the foot of the master for the next four years and most doctors think that hell be around at least that long
9268187 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9268188 i am desperate and that obama acceptance speech event totally freaked me out
9268189 well this isnt too bad i dont have my left arm anymore but at least nobody will ever ask me whether i am right handed or left handed
9268190 they care primarily for themselves they arent heroes at times they arent even likable i kind of like that its a superhero comic about desperate people they all know their lives arent going to end well
9268191 i also find the chemistry between them fascinating the core members to a man including catman are selfish spoiled brats to some degree and they are always thinking about themselves primarily but in that mode they still somehow have come to like and trust each other which they all hate to varying degrees its not their nature theyre the anti jla in that regard you cant really call them friends but theyre the closest thing to friends any of them have ever known
9268192 why do they keep spending money on that black city
9268193 of couse you know a few people who are killing it in warm market memory jogger marketing why they are the top 4 of marketers they have the people skills
9268194 i can only assume even in my sleep smeared semi consciousness that raul is trying to get my attention
9268195 i told him that there would be no coffee at the rectory until 7am at the earliest in fact to be on the safe side try back sometime after 10
9268196 padrecito next time i like a little bit milk in my caf
9268197 space you dont fool me youre not a something youre nothing
9268198 every time something separates it becomes clearer what something is for then the different kinds of somethings can be compared therefore i will know myself better the more i divide into new kinds of something
9268199 this is nothing until now every time we separate something we found higher states of something but now we have found nothing so what happens if we separate nothing
9268200 kill him kill kill you have to kill him you understand
9268201 make themselves like a man a woman like a man the punishment is kill kill them throw them from the highest place
9268202 it is not befitting for muslims that he should reside in the land of evil the land of the kuffaar the land of the disbelievers
9268203 the stone that the builder refused shall be the head corner stone
9268204 the wedding made the front page you were smiling bright you were dressed in white angel white standing there with mr right
9268205 holding you is the safest place no doubt about it kissing you makes me wonder how i lived without it wanting you is as natural as natural can be love wont get any better
9268206 hey its romeo you nearly gave me a heart attack yeah well
9268207 hey la my boyfriends back you shouldnt come around here singin up to people like that oh anyway what you gonna do about it
9268208 romeo i think i used to have a scene with him
9268209 i love you like the stars above im gonna love you till i die
9268210 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9268211 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day
9268212 we could see flooding even worse than we saw in hurricane katrina
9268213 i wouldnt worry about whether the evacuation in your parish begins at 4 p m today or 8 a m tomorrow
9268214 when it comes to evacuation do it sooner rather than later
9268215 my last 24 hours have been somewhat worrisome and very very prayerful because this is a very serious threat and its a lot of people to get to safe ground or be safe where they are
9268216 this is very very serious and we need you to heed this warning
9268217 we really dont have the resources to rescue you after this
9268218 i kept the television off and didnt discuss war with the kids around if they had questions or worries i reminded them that he was going to be as safe as possible and that it was our job to pray for all the soldiers not just daddy i set up individual e mail accounts for each child as they got older but dad was the only one who e mailed them they loved that they always got to talk to him individually whenever he called and as long as it wasnt a school night id wake them even if he called late it was worth the loss of a few minutes of sleep
9268219 consider having daddy say goodbye to the kids at home and then you and only you go with him to the airport its very tough on kids when they see mommy and daddy crying
9268220 it was a takeoff play and the ball was right there it felt really good
9268221 it was running through my mind that i had to catch that ball you dont get that many opportunities to catch a deep ball like that as a true freshman so i knew i had to make my mark early
9268222 he made some great plays and im pretty sure he was good on his assignments so thats definitely a positive
9268223 there were a lot of expectations with me coming in here and i felt i had to show the people something one of my strongest points is just to throw it up and let me go get it
9268224 the touchdown was great but that first reception was more meaningful to make a play in front of 92 000 when youre a true freshman and youre running a deep route thats the greatest feeling ever
9268225 when i got out there i was thinking man ive really got to get a hold of this its 52 yards and its my first kick ive got to get my entire leg into it
9268226 when i saw it i said yeah but i actually didnt get to see the whole kick because tight end tripp chandler pretty much drilled me and about broke my ribs
9268227 ever since i was told i was going to play i was scared and nervous
9268228 but i went out and did what i had to do i was feeling butterflies the whole time
9268229 i kept waking up and feeling my heart pumping away by my second or third snap i wasnt feeling nervous anymore
9268230 its encouraging to see the young guys get in there and handle themselves in front of that big crowd
9268231 they knew what they were doing and they did a good job
9268232 everyone starts 0 0 we have a chance to create a new identity create the 2008 new york giants up until this point all anyone has to go on is what we accomplished last year at this time last year we were coming off an 8 8 season that a lot of people called disappointing we had a lot to prove i think in many ways this year is very similar
9268233 the no 1 thing is frustration anxiety knots in your stomach
9268234 you know all the things that go along with the injury to the players which do not allow your team to function as it was presented on paper any of those types of things are very difficult for a coach no matter what age you are
9268235 clearly when the regular season starts it goes to another level
9268236 and as defending champs its a new challenge and were looking forward to it people can say whatever they want about us being defending champs that was last year our slogan this year has been that talk is cheap we have to go out and do it
9268237 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9268238 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day
9268239 we could see flooding even worse than we saw in hurricane katrina
9268240 i wouldnt worry about whether the evacuation in your parish begins at 4 p m today or 8 a m tomorrow
9268241 when it comes to evacuation do it sooner rather than later
9268242 my last 24 hours have been somewhat worrisome and very very prayerful because this is a very serious threat and its a lot of people to get to safe ground or be safe where they are
9268243 this is very very serious and we need you to heed this warning
9268244 we really dont have the resources to rescue you after this
9268245 reached across party lines to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists
9268246 the two worked together for barely a week after which mccain accused obama of partisan posturing
9268247 i drove the ball well and i was never in a position to cause any angst or anxiety
9268248 but it was so cool the ball just wasnt going anywhere
9268249 i used the long putter for the first time this week and i made some putts yesterday and today
9268250 its so insidious the way it turns your mind against you
9268251 its the closest i can imagine to hearing voices or being possessed it really does feel alien like something else is at work inside you
9268252 the most tragic consequence is the psychiatric spiral it causes
9268253 we know children of mothers with postpartum depression have more emotional problems as adults for instance they struggle to develop and sustain healthy relationships
9268254 new mothers are very sensitive to the idea they should be good mothers that their maternal function is paramount
9268255 when they perceive theyre failing in that role it creates both shame and a tendency to conceal it
9268256 the goal is to make postpartum depression a more mainstream conversation
9268257 thats the first step in getting women to realize they can do something about the problem
9268258 i would hope anyone who feels the way i did would see a doctor and if the doctor brushes her off she should find another
9268259 no one should have to deal with it themselves no one deserves to feel that way
9268260 tourists its time to leave the city do not wait
9268261 i dont think any doubt came into my mind we never thought that we were going to lose the game
9268262 what came into my mind was weve got to do something to get going we were a little stagnant we came out a little bit flat in the third quarter
9268263 we just cant afford that many fumbles especially in one quarter
9268264 i dont think we panicked at all we came out in the fourth quarter and put a couple more scores on the board
9268265 i really dont consider it much success other than the long ones
9268266 it was a takeoff play and the ball was right there it felt really good
9268267 it was running through my mind that i had to catch that ball you dont get that many opportunities to catch a deep ball like that as a true freshman so i knew i had to make my mark early
9268268 he made some great plays and im pretty sure he was good on his assignments so thats definitely a positive
9268269 there were a lot of expectations with me coming in here and i felt i had to show the people something one of my strongest points is just to throw it up and let me go get it the touchdown was great but that first reception was more meaningful to make a play in front of 92 000 when youre a true freshman and youre running a deep route thats the greatest feeling ever
9268270 when i saw it i said yeah but i actually didnt get to see the whole kick because tight end tripp chandler pretty much drilled me and about broke my ribs
9268271 ever since i was told i was going to play i was scared and nervous
9268272 but i went out and did what i had to do i was feeling butterflies the whole time
9268273 i kept waking up and feeling my heart pumping away by my second or third snap i wasnt feeling nervous anymore
9268274 its encouraging to see the young guys get in there and handle themselves in front of that big crowd
9268275 they knew what they were doing and they did a good job
9268276 elevated psa does not necessarily mean cancer it could be an enlargement or infection or cancer
9268277 having that blood test elevated means youre at higher risk to have cancer it doesnt mean you have it
9268278 the higher the blood test is though the more likely you are to have cancer
9268279 psa levels and severity of prostate cancer pretty much go hand in hand
9268280 the more cancer you have the higher the psa is
9268281 but if youre on deaths door from something else you dont need to be screened for prostate cancer
9268282 it takes a while for prostate cancer to kill you
9268283 but since we started screening people for prostate cancer the mortality rate in the country has dropped
9268284 so i kind of take that as a pretty good indication that it has saved peoples lives
9268285 you cant prove in any study that screening actually saves lives
9268286 a biopsy has a chance of bleeding and infection and problems
9268287 its not a perfect process but no test like that is perfect
9268288 they can do more with it if they detect it early
9268289 the idea behind these screenings is to give people the opportunity to learn about prostate cancer so that they know about it and continue to get checked
9268290 if you do die of prostate cancer it can be pretty bad
9268291 i packed up my clothes my medicine and some water and a little snacks
9268292 i have some anxiety i dont know how long well be riding
9268293 verde is a nice pet he likes to swim in the water
9268294 im going to a shelter because there is a hurricane coming toward my house its a big one and we have to evacuate
9268295 i wanted to bring the fish because they would starve if nobody is here to feed them
9268296 well when i got back home after the storm my neighbors tree had toppled on the house
9268297 half the roof was gone it had messed up my fence and the ceiling was messed up there was a lot of water damage
9268298 but im glad everything went smoother this time and im grateful the people here and my daughter were able to help me
9268299 were way way ahead of where we were with rita
9268300 we asked him if he was going to ride this one out
9268301 selamat menunaikan ibadah puasa ramadhan 1429 h mohon maaf lahir dan batin semoga semua amal ibadah kita selama bulan suci ini diterima allah swt
9268302 there have been some recent signs that our economy is beginning to improve
9268303 there are families across our country struggling to make ends meet
9268304 oh this just the latest issue of archie and friends so what did you say your symptoms were
9268305 thats why i never push fat sunny on a swing

9268311 i got kicked out of barnes and noble once for moving all the bibles into the fiction section
9268312 good child bearing hips and the ability to be a great housewife
9268313 but the olympic athletes they are real role models this is the america we like to see
9268314 shes shown a woman can run companies can lead philanthropic organizations can do really anything
9268315 it was like being in new york city with one of the beatles
9268316 people were stopping in the streets and climbing up things to see him they were going nuts hes like a superstar
9268317 for americas kids the time to play and swim is today
9268318 we need everyones help in providing all kids with safe and well equipped spaces where they can exercise have fun and maybe even begin to pursue their own
9268319 from the look on his face being in that pool was the highlight of his day all the stress just melted away
9268320 in the year 2004 ati fans marveled in their own magnificence as ati gave birth to catalyst a i we dont know who struck first nvidia or us but it is us who scorched the iq forever
9268321 i am happy because i want to die i want to despair i want to return to nothing
9268322 yes of course you are now we got to buckle down and save planet express
9268323 they the awful misogynist woman hating they think enough of women to put one in the 2 spot why wouldnt you do that for us
9268324 but they wanted a democrat to win and they were willing to suck it up and take one for the party in pretty much the same way that an emotionally abused wife sucks it up and takes the abuse for her kids sake
9268325 think her personal charisma and the appeal of her bio will
9268326 caseys attorney jose baez diligently tried to contact authorities to surrender his client
9268327 the arrest and the drama at the anthony home tonight only added insult upon injury for the family of the kidnapped child
9268328 wev already lost one child we dont want to lose another
9268329 im not gonna be bullied and the only thing is focusing on finding caylee
9268330 both sides ought to be properly taught so people can understand what the debate is about
9268331 hawkish foreign policy irresponsible tax cuts more talk about religion and abortion all this sounds too much like bush three
9268332 i like snowmobile racing shooting guns and fishing and mooseburgers are my favorite food
9268333 note to self to get a gun into an obama event hide it in a cane
9268334 you need to be scared you need to be concerned
9268335 you need to get you butt out of new orleans this is the storm of the century
9268336 if it stays on this southwest louisiana track gustav will be like a hybrid between katrina and rita and right in the middle youve got the huge atchafalaya basin
9268337 the bottom line is that what katrina and rita didnt destroy in 2005 this storm has the potential to do
9268338 so even though i of course saw the films here in japan i never made a connection between the character yoda and my own name but whenever i leave japan its a different story people think i changed my name because im a crazy star wars fan or that im just kidding around even people who know im not making it up are always giving me yoda trinkets and keychains and figures so i had this little shrine to him going on for a while
9268339 were hoping to stick to a two year cycle after that
9268340 they comcast affect customers who are using little bandwidth simply because they are using a disfavored application they are not employed only during times of the day when congestion is prevalent the companys equipment does not target only those neighborhoods suffering from congestion and a customer may use an extraordinary amount of bandwidth during periods of network congestion and will be totally unaffected so long as he does not utilize an application disfavored by comcast
9268341 excuse me for being late i had to polish my megapixels to make them look perfect
9268342 this is to inform you that your email have won a price money of two hundred and seventy five thousand united kingdom pounds in a lottery promotion organized by yahoo lottery inc for the introduction of all new yahoo mail beta and yahoo male classic which all yahoo users are required to switch onto
9268343 while phishing messages are known for their bad grammar and spelling this one really sinks to new lows
9268344 a culmination of everything that he has been getting as feedback on the calorie tracker widget people want to be able to track calories from foods make their own lists and create plan meals all in an intuitive interface
9268345 ie8 brings some changes that allow much more customization that i think users will be happy with you can unlock the toolbars and drag the ie menu bar to a variety of places in ie8 you can also right click in ie8s menu and choose customize where you can have the refresh and stop buttons moved to the front of the address bar those who also prefer not to have the favorites bar showing will be pleased to know you can turn it off although i dont know why you would want to
9268346 based on our observations of ie7 and ie8 beta 1 usage we learned that roughly 80 of the time peoples destination on the web is a previously visited site in the past people would use their favorites or history or theyd just go through all the steps to navigate to the website again the smart address bar enables you to find favorites and sites in your history by just typing a few letters thats much fewer steps than using the favorites and history center we also added the capability to search the title web address and even folders for those who have organized their favorites
9268347 wed heard from many many users that the find dialog in ie6 and ie7 was always getting in the way making it hard to actually find content on the page so weve added a find bar at the top of the page finally that lets you more easily find content on the page
9268348 copy navigate paste is old accelerators are services that you access directly from the webpage in the context of what youre doing letting you bookmark define email map and more with a simple selection even your search providers are available as accelerators some accelerators provide previews so that you can view the result without having to leave the current webpage clicking on an accelerator opens a new tab with the full result
9268349 in ie8 we make it easier to find sites you might like once you turn on suggested sites ie looks at what sites you visit and then offers recommendations of other similar or related sites right from the favorites bar if you dont have suggested sites on already try it out by going to the favorites center and clicking on the turn on suggested sites button at the bottom of the menu
9268350 the reliability improvements in ie8 beta 2 are big crash recovery is nice but not crashing is even better because in ie8 loosely coupled ie lcie separates the frame the address bar back button etc from the tabs and the tabs mostly from each other crashes are more contained and affect fewer tabs than before we think users will also appreciate having close boxes on all their toolbars so that disabling ones they dont want while leaving the ones they do is easier
9268351 ie8 is more interoperable with other web browsers and web standards the contribution of css 2 1 test cases to the w3c is an important in order to really establish a standard way to assess standards support we think that css 2 1 remains the most important place to deliver excellent interoperability between browsers we think developers will enjoy the improvements to the built in tools as well as the other opportunities to integrate their sites in the users daily life with accelerators and web slices

9268355 the more carbs and sugars you eat the more your appetite control cells are damaged and potentially you consume more
9268356 people in the age group of 25 to 50 are most at risk the neurons that tell people in the crucial age range not to over eat are being killed off
9268357 when the stomach is empty it triggers the ghrelin hormone that notifies the brain that we are hungry when we are full a set of neurons known as pomcs kick in
9268358 however free radicals created naturally in the body attack the pomc neurons this process causes the neurons to degenerate overtime affecting our judgement as to when our hunger is satisfied
9268359 a diet rich in carbohydrate and sugar that has become more and more prevalent in modern societies over the last 20 30 years has placed so much strain on our bodies that its leading to premature cell deterioration
9268360 the genes we identified are necessary for embryonic stem cells to maintain a memory of who they are
9268361 without them the cell doesnt know whether it should remain a stem cell or differentiate into a specialized cell

9268363 a very important demographic in this election is going to be the politically independent woman 15 of whom in our latest survey are undecided
9268364 in the final analysis this election will be about obama vs
9268365 this contest is likely to be very close until the weekend before the election then the dam may break and support may flood one way or the other
9268366 sarah palin was showered with boos for attempting to praise clintons trail blazing bid to become the first female president
9268367 it has the potential to impact every area of this metropolitan
9268368 this is worse than a betsy worse than a katrina

9268371 the totality of the research on cocoa flavanols is impressive this is just one more study adding to an increasing body of literature connecting regular cocoa flavanol consumption to blood flow and vascular health improvements throughout the body
9268372 though more research is needed these findings raise the possibility that flavanol rich cocoa products could be developed to help slow brain decline in older age
9268373 high energy prices have led to an increase in biodiesel production which in turn has led to an increase in the amount of crude glycerol in the market
9268374 we have shown that it is possible to use the crude glycerol byproduct from the biodiesel industry as a carbon source for microalgae that produce omega 3 fatty acids
9268375 after thorough chemical analysis we have also shown that the algae biomass composition has the same quality as the commercial algae product
9268376 the fish fed the algae had significant amounts of omega 3 fatty acids
9268377 production of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid from biodiesel waste glycerol by microalgal fermentation agfd 272

9268398 mallika wanigasundara who passed away on 4 april 2008 aged 81 went in search of causes and process that shape the everyday news headlines she blazed new trails in issue based journalism covering topics ranging from health and environment to children women and social justice
9268399 it was only last year that the editors guild of sri lanka and the sri lanka press institute presented her the lifetime achievement gold medal for excellence in journalism in 1990 she was selected by the united nations environment programme for the global 500 award
9268400 mallika was associated with the sri lankan media in one capacity or another for over half a century starting her professional career in 1956 with the sinhala evening daily janatha she later moved on to english language journalism at lake house where she worked first in
9268401 mallika also helped put sri lanka on the world map of development journalism beginning in the early 1980s she contributed sri lankan stories to depthnews published by the press foundation of asia based in manila and to panos features syndicated globally by the panos institute in london
9268402 in those pre web days these services when printed in newspapers and magazines were among the most dependable sources for ground level reporting from far corners of the world alas both services have since gone the way of the dodo not to mention asiaweek south and gemini
9268403 it was characteristic of many accomplished journalists of her generation that they remained mostly in the background shaping news coverage and analysis some even didnt nurture a personal by line writing under pseudonyms or simply not signing their names on their work

9268410 meine tracks m ssen ein bestimmtes gef hl erzeugen und man soll sie sowohl anh ren als auch auflegen k nnen
9268411 ich versuche immer auch sachen zu spielen die die leute entweder noch nie geh rt haben oder nicht erwarten entscheidend dabei ist dass es musik ist hinter der ich pers nlich stehe in einem club geht es um den vibe nicht unbedingt um genres wenn die leute die zuh ren sich gegen ber dem vibe ffnen hast du die chance die styles zu wechseln ohne sie zu verlieren

9268418 in the direct sense vice presidents dont have much to do with what goes on in classrooms but a person whos a creationist doesnt understand science and technology at all

9268447 i got caught in the water and spent two days on my roof no food no water it was pretty bad
9268448 people are afraid of coming back after the storm they want some protection when they walk back in
9268449 ill never leave again just being away worrying about it last time id have rather been here
9268450 its exciting to know i got one under my belt with this whole knee deal
9268451 im back to 100 percent i feel good and were ready to start preparing for ohio state
9268452 thats an exciting aspect of our offense that i felt like we didnt have the last couple of years
9268453 knowing we have these two weeks to prepare means a lot too
9268454 you can just sense that if you give him time back there hes going to find guys and hes got a real attitude about him to take advantage of it
9268455 the only way to bounce back from a game like this is to take it as a learning experience
9268456 we will have a lot of work to do in practice
9268457 i moved when i needed to and was really happy out there
9268458 the time to judge me is at the end of the season
9268459 it would have been better if it had all been a lot calmer
9268460 the ideal situation is to get all your squad in place early but unfortunately we have not been able to do that
9268461 every club works in its own particular fashion and damien has been doing his best to bring players in as soon as possible
9268462 i have an excellent relationship with him and speak to him daily it was the same story at seville everyone has been working with the right intentions but sometimes negotiations become complicated and with berbatov it has dragged on and on which has made things difficult
9268463 without doubt he has had an awful lot to do with our start to the season the other players are doing their best to concentrate 100 but their work has been affected by it the sooner it is sorted out the better it has had an unsettling effect on the club
9268464 that is a theory that has no substance or sense
9268465 if he was to stay and i have said all along that i would really be pleased if he did then he would be in the first team thats where your best players belong
9268466 chelsea are built to be champions or at least contenders in every competition they enter they have the ability to sign the top echelon stars from anywhere around the world the cream of the crop they are set up to try to win every trophy we are in a different league in that respect and its a case of two clubs going in slightly different directions
9268467 thats what were working hard to do and we are capable of doing it little by little day by day
9268468 i dont think theres any doubt about that were in better shape but obviously now weve got to show that on the field at the end of the season you can evaluate whether my claim is true
9268469 we cant be talking about what happened at the end of last season as were right at the beginning of a fresh new one
9268470 there are explanations for the drop off in form we had won the carling cup so the objective of getting into europe had already been achieved and we were lying 10th or 11th in the table knowing that we could not go up far or go down far i think that helps to explain it
9268471 after so many years in football i know all about winning and losing
9268472 i also know the main thing to do is to concentrate on working hard and doing my job
9268473 the season is very long and the time to sum things up and make judgments is at the end losing now doesnt necessarily mean you are doing something wrong
9268474 what scientists have only recently begun to realize is that people may do their best thinking when they are not concentrating on work at all
9268475 are we even craft people or are we simply the directors of craft people
9268476 sort of like a page out of norman rockwell our customers these guys have become our friends ive watched tony have a compassionate ear when a guy loses a wife or a kid has some trouble this place has been a venue in the neighborhood where he could do good hes like an older brother to the neighborhood
9268477 you have to keep your hand in to stay young im not cutting back
9268478 he was just a boy in the wrong place chilling with his friends who thought they were bloods
9268479 when i was growing up listening to music i was thinking yeah i want to be a thug i want to be feared by other people
9268480 that is what we grew up in that is no excuse but we were surrounded by it
9268481 they agreed to shoot the ones but the whole time we knew they were going to pull out knives
9268482 they just want to fit in and get respect from the older guys
9268483 a lot of these kids want to play like theyre big men but theyre going to get hurt theyre good kids they just need guidance
9268484 my friend didnt say anything to them they just came up and said are you in ms 13
9268485 i didnt feel anything i was too busy helping my friend
9268486 it makes me want even more to stay out of gangs
9268487 one day you might run into a real gangster who will hurt you
9268488 hey buddy do you want this sex tape in the testimonial
9268489 hey did you know the human rights official presiding over our case is jewish were just sayin is all

9268491 emangnya ketua mpr mau jadi jaksa agung tugasnya kan beda nggak usah komentar dan campur tangan dalam kasus ini karena urusan hukum dan eksekusi ada lembaganya yang mengatur
9268492 seharusnya ia mengurusi rakyat yang kelaparan harga minyak dan gas yang naik hal itu lebih bermanfaat ketimbang komentar eksekusi amrozi cs
9268493 ketua mpr ngelamar aja ke jaksa agung dan minta agar dipilih menjadi eksekutor
9268494 he hasnt shown respect to israel and many of the jewish constituencies here based on the things he has done
9268495 it shows the party gets it and barack obamas campaign gets it
9268496 i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9268497 if our state wanted a bridge i said wed build it ourselves

9268555 i dont believe in frettin and grievin why mess around with strife i never was cut out to step and strut out give me the simple life some find it pleasant dining on pheasant those things roll off my knife just serve me tomatoes and mashed potatoes give me the simple life a cottage small is all im after not one thats spacious and wide a house that rings with joy and laughter and the ones you love inside some like the high road i like the low road free from the care and strife sounds corny and seedy but yes indeed y give me the simple life

9268561 el aula es hoy un espacio cada vez m s extra o para el alumno donde pasan cosas que no tienen nada que ver con lo que ocurre en el resto de la sociedad
9268562 antes en el colegio uno se enteraba de muchas cosas de las que no se pod a enterar en otra parte pero eso se acab hoy los alumnos reciben informaci n de muchas otras fuentes y la misi n de la escuela debiera ser ayudarles a digerir esos datos y convertirlos en conocimiento
9268563 si el profesor se concibe a s mismo como alguien que entrega saber y no como quien ayuda a encontrarlo va a seguir desprestigi ndose pues no puede competir con las nuevas tecnolog as
9268564 es que para cambiar la educaci n no basta con cambiar las normas las leyes los preceptos hay que cambiar la cultura de los centros las pr cticas educativas de los docentes y la concepci n que tienen los profesores y los alumnos acerca de lo que debe pasar en el aula
9268565 hay tres niveles uno es hacer cambios en la pol tica educativa que afecten la carrera docente otro generar centros educacionales m s participativos y se requiere un modelo distinto de formaci n docente que ayude a los profesores a resolver los problemas del aula actual no la de hace 30 a os porque hoy la escuela ense a contenidos del siglo xix con profesores del siglo xx a alumnos del siglo xxi
9268566 las universidades deben poner en marcha los modelos en los que creen el problema es que en educaci n las teor as son m s dif ciles de trasladar a la pr ctica porque lo que hay que cambiar no es una t cnica rutinaria sino la mentalidad del docente hoy cada escuela es una realidad distinta no hay t cnicas que funcionen siempre se requiere un docente que sepa adaptar la teor a a la realidad en la que trabaja
9268567 no digo eso sino que la t cnica ya no es suficiente antes los profesores aprend an ciertos m todos que resultaban siempre pero eso era en una poca en que la educaci n era m s selectiva donde los alumnos que no respond an a ese patr n simplemente eran excluidos ahora la escuela recibe a todos los estudiantes y no hay recetas universales el aula es cada vez m s impredecible y el docente debe estar siempre buscando nuevas soluciones

9268569 st paul the republican party platform this year will reassert the partys opposition to abortion and again it will not allow for exceptions in the cases of rape incest or to save the life of the mother even though senator john mccain the presumptive presidential nominee has long called for such exceptions
9268570 connie mackey a lobbyist for the family research council said
9268571 as utilized by social reactionaries references some sort of carbon based creature the rest of us cant see
9268572 in every generation we have people that do different things
9268573 barack obama has become the ultimate expression of our being able to expand beyond a racial straight jacket and win
9268574 at that same time in this generation we will still engage in civil rights barack and i are of the same generation about six years apart
9268575 and its makers mocking it in none too subtle fashion
9268576 now i can tell my grandson that the sky is the limit and theres finally living proof
9268577 speech i knew that in fact i watched mlks speech on youtube beforehand so that i could identify the points at which obama sampled themes and words even with this in mind i felt as if i was there to cheer for obama like a self respecting professional bronco fan
9268578 old guys like me have to go to the bathroom a lot but thats no bother at all on a day like this because this is the greatest day
9268579 because now i can tell my grandson that the sky is the limit and theres finally living proof im about to see living proof finally
9268580 now i can tell my grandson that the sky i thanks for this wonderful story this coming from you as the founder amp ceo of ac has truly inspired even more commitment peace amp continued blessings
9268581 hey obamas at a distinct disadvantage here let me pick someone with as little experience as he has to level the playing field
9268582 he was diagnosed with downs syndrome before birth and she chose to have him anyway
9268583 there is a huge difference between presidential candidate and their vp running mate

9268585 i wish i could encourage the community to stop trying to find the perfect orm
9268586 the most common question i get these days when i meet people at user groups or conferences is
9268587 the durant back field men did some good work breaking through caddos line at will and breaking up their interference easily caddos men worked hard all the time and went down to defeat fighting to the very last showing that although they lost this game they are going to keep on until they are in better condition and then look out for they have the spirit that will win the durant men were in better physical condition by far than the caddo boys and their playing showed that they have had a great deal more training this year than their opponents caddo lacked endurance and also were very poor with their interference which accounts for the one sided score
9268588 the government is necessary the government is legitimate democracy is representative of the people democracy is the best form of government majority rule is legitimate checks and balances actually function voting is meaningful or even an obligation we have a meaningful choice between political parties and canidates governments form as a result of the social contract the good of society the rule of law law provides order only the government can provide certain services society must be modeled or planned without a pre existing design there cannot be a society
9268589 i wouldnt call it a nightmare but it is a very perplexing challenge
9268590 he wants to do something service oriented if and when the storm hits and its as bad as its expected to be now
9268591 standing beneath this serene sky overlooking these broad fields now reposing from the labors of the waning year the mighty alleghenies dimly towering before us the graves of our brethren beneath our feet it is with hesitation that i raise my poor voice to break the eloquent silence of god and nature but the duty to which you have called me must be performed grant me i pray you your indulgence and your sympathy
9268592 but they i am sure will join us in saying as we bid farewell to the dust of these martyr heroes that wheresoever throughout the civilized world the accounts of this great warfare are read and down to the latest period of recorded time in the glorious annals of our common country there will be no brighter page than that which relates the battles of gettysburg
9268593 obamas strategic skills have been obvious for quite a while he is perfectly prepared to hang back in a campaign to allow attacks to pummel him and to lose news cycles or primaries to a media centric opponent america is at war with lethal enemies its economy is teetering its people are unsettled and mccain gave us a 44 year old former beauty queen as the person who could be asked to take over the white house in an emergency if anything happened to the oldest first term president in american history tactically daring strategically potentially disastrous
9268594 we may be seeing the first woman president as a democrat i am reeling
9268595 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails
9268596 good lord we had barely 12 hours of democrat optimism
9268597 it was a stunningly timed piece of pr by the republicans
9268598 obama is good at strategy and macain sucks at it
9268599 the treble on the pa is too low so you cant hear him articulate certain consonants
9268600 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven moore said laughing
9268601 farenheit 9 11 got him in front of the anti war circus since then he is pretty much back to being inconsequential i suspect he is simply too disgusting for even the dems to associate with
9268602 anybody who expects to win politically by having his country suffer should be taken to the nearest whipping post
9268603 in an effort to recruit him to their faculty the university of chicago law school provided obama with a fellowship and an office to work on his book he originally planned to finish the book in one year but it took much longer as the book evolved into a personal memoir in order to work without interruptions obama and his wife michelle traveled to bali where he wrote for several months the manuscript was finally published as dreams from my father in mid 1995
9268604 pattern of rarely volunteering information or documents even when relatively innocuous
9268605 i think there is a problem though with the media gushing over him too much
9268606 who is going to report city council and zoning board meetings who is going to go through the records at the county courthouse ferreting out the corruption be careful what you wish for
9268607 ive got to keep on talking in order to explain myself clearly to everyone in the vicinity because if i dont then theyre liable to think what

9268610 has anyone considered how damn dumb and slack the crew of a pt boat has to be to get rammed by a ship 10x their size in the dark the japs had bugger all radar there were islands in the neighborhood the pt boat is a small fast maneuverable beast in pitch darkness just how would someone high up in a warship see something as low in the water as a pt boat without the pt boat seeing him first if the pt boat was moving fast enough to leave a visible wake why wasnt it going fast enough to dodge something like a destroyer was the crew asleep was whoever was on deck smoking with the cigarette or flare of the match visible kennedy was in charge it was his boat he probably should have been court martialled but then his father the rum runner was ex ambassador to england or ireland or whatever
9268611 he wrote an autobiography when he was only 34 years old entitled dreams of my father
9268612 that the leftist elite now at the control levers of the msm continue to repeat that behavior even when the credibility and revenue loss is been apparent may testify to the sheer religiosity of their dognma
9268613 do stupid people realize they are stupid or do they just think that everyone else is functioning at the same level they are because they cant comprehend anything different
9268614 among the most vital tenets of alinskys method were the following

9268617 he will be driven either to participation or else to a public and private admission of his own lack of faith in democracy and man
9268618 he will be driven to an admission of his own lack of faith in democracy and man
9268619 he will be driven to a lack of faith in man
9268620 what is faith for if not to save you from me
9268621 there is always a temptation for junior officer to try and impress his troops by going in closer with guns blazing i am certainly guilty of having had dreams of such glory myself
9268622 sometimes a bright guy in the field has an idea on how to do things better we are not like the russians chained to a rigid control system but generally speaking these ideas should be approved by senior officers first
9268623 what was most striking about that bit of flailing from wretch was his asumption that the old black man hazily recalling rewriting his history of influence was necessarily a heavy obama man
9268624 the story was introduced in a context that was intended to be flattering to bho by persons who are his admirers wrong it was intended to be flattering to percy sutton
9268625 you want to distance yourself from this or are you signing on
9268626 so whats there to distance myself from people can watch suttons video for themselves im not saying it sutton is all i want to know is whether its true
9268627 this is not a time for us to play fair so let the crazy rumors fly

9268635 and said that thence man could not further go and the gallegans that were all turned to belief in god by the preaching of s james 96 and his two disciples and that had turned afte wards to the sect of the moors were baptized by the hands of archbishop turpin and those who would not be baptized he put to the sword or into the power of the christened and this time the king conquered spain from sea to sea
9268636 so i took leave hanging up my arms in the cathedral church where there were many i had done the like already in the chapel at finisterre
9268637 the cape of finisterre is two miles high surrounded and beaten upon by the sea there are the footmarks footsteps of buddha in ceylon of our lord s james and a well that he made himself with his own hands there is one in the hillside above padr n and one just before you get to santiago besides also a sort of chair in which sat s peter and s james and s john

9268640 we are those whom the king sent to explore the confines of the sea that we should write the marvels we saw
9268641 we know those men and they were not such as you not worn not hoary but youngsters of twenty six years

9268656 no it should be moral of the story not message
9268657 ok what i mean is i want all of you to tell me what is the one key message you get out of this story
9268658 i do not foresee any improvement in these issues for at least a year
9268659 declared him medically fit to run for political office and free of any symptoms
9268660 you have got to understand that while he was in prison on charges that were never proven there were attempts to kill him
9268661 at that time he was surrounded by fear all the time
9268662 these are diversionary tactics to avoid a decision its not a question of negotiating teams its a matter of do you want it or dont you
9268663 people gave the impression we were close when rice was here but its not over

9268669 we have found the male programming window which occurs far earlier in foetal development than was previously thought before the reproductive organs fully develop this is when the androgens such as testosterone in the foetus are at their most active
9268670 if the male foetus does not receive enough androgens it may not realise its full reproductive potential including the size of the penis and testes undescended testes or the sperm count the chances are something will be wrong with the reproductive system it may be one thing or several things
9268671 women could stop using body creams and perfumes although we do not have conclusive evidence that they do harm there are components about which there are question marks for example it could be certain combinations of chemicals if you are thinking about how a baby might be exposed thats one way and its something positive you can do it might have no consequence but its something positive women can do for their baby
9268672 a lot of women will not even know they are pregnant at this stage or how far along they are i would be very concerned about alarming women until these tests have been done on humans we welcome any new research in infertility but we would like to see a lot more research in this area before the findings on animals can be said for humans
9268673 the scottish government are funding 80 of the games and glasgow city council 20 with no contribution from westminster so it is entirely reasonable that lottery funding is restored to scotland to help boost the legacy investment
9268674 the funding is in place for the games but the legacy of the games is more important in many ways than the games themselves and we need the funding in place to make sure we maximise the games potential
9268675 glasgows east end is one of the most deprived areas of the country it not only needs this extra funding it deserves it
9268676 the legacy that we are talking about for the london olympics in 2012 is matched by the need for a legacy for glasgows games in 2014 the commonwealth games organisers have done a lot already but more funding is needed to mark that legacy
9268677 one of the most exciting aspects of london 2012 and glasgow 2014 is the opportunity they present to regenerate sport across the country and deliver a sporting legacy for the future
9268678 glasgows candidate city file for the 2014 games set out the various revenue streams that were expected and this did not include any funding from the lottery
9268679 this is new guidance for ministerial offices in responding to correspondence on reserved issues clearly on a number of subjects reserved to westminster including international affairs and trident nuclear weapons the scottish government has a different position from the uk administration and one more in tune with the majority of people in scotland
9268680 alex salmond fundamentally has no respect for devolution the devolution divide has been backed by the people of scotland who have voted for it that means that the people of scotland want westminster to do some things and the scottish government to do other things we respect that but he has contempt for it
9268681 i dont know on what basis they can produce a scottish government view on these areas
9268682 arizona is changing it used to be a more reliably republican state but as people have come in from other states they have taken their politics with them mccain has the same problem with republicans in arizona as he has with republicans in the rest of the country
9268683 he is conservative enough on social and foreign policy and some economic policy to appeal to those elements while also deploying the occasional liberal view which appeals to independents and undecideds
9268684 if you cross him he doesnt forget hes like an elephant
9268685 but he is just as famous for his showy acts of conciliation luxurious gift baskets saying im sorry i blew up at you
9268686 a large part of him and his appeal is that he feels he can talk himself out of anything and he is notoriously fearless when challenged
9268687 at least i dont plaster on the make up like a trollop you c
9268688 i think he is mentally unstable and not fit to be president
9268689 when are we going to send an airmail message to tehran
9268690 listen pal i spent 22 years in the navy my father was in the navy my grandfather was in the navy we in the military service tend to move a lot we have to live in all parts of the country all parts of the world i wish i could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of arizona but i was doing other things as a matter of fact when i think about it now the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi
9268691 for a politician mccain sure talks a lot of sense i admire him he has life experience and he speaks out for what he believes in
9268692 i wouldnt vote for obama no way hes a muslim
9268693 one way its caused is that the original audio may have been the 2nd 3rd or 4th audio stream when you author that audio naturally becomes the 1st audio stream it can easily be fixed using
9268694 t advertisement he people didnt want to join and we didnt have enough money
9268695 if the us administration sees that its war against the muslims is legitimate then what makes us believe that our war on its territories is not legitimate
9268696 everyone must know that we will not hesitate in targeting it whenever we can and wherever it is on this planet
9268697 a group that had limited its terrorist activities to algeria is now part of the global jihad movement
9268698 these groups as best we can tell have a fair amount of independence they get inspiration they get sometimes guidance probably some training probably some money from the al qaeda leadership
9268699 its not as centralised a movement as it was say in 2001 but in some ways the fact that it has spread in the way that it has in my view makes it perhaps more dangerous
9268700 the brothers implementing the process are connected with us and we have previously trained some of them and we offer them adequate support for the implementation of such operations
9268701 successfully employed by insurgents and terrorists in iraq and afghanistan
9268702 terrorism has been vanquished despite the sporadic manifestation we are facing up to in the most energetic manner
9268703 she has an extraordinary talent when it comes to communicating personally with people its as simple as that
9268704 that obviously propelled her into the governors mansion in alaska

9268707 every bridge all the way from scotland had people on waving scottish flags and cheering it got a much bigger response than anyone was expecting
9268708 it was quite an emotional event for people involved colin was the kind of character people admired he was a very personable and down to earth and was taken away before his time
9268709 ive had enough kidnapping corrupt police a rotten judicial system
9268710 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive maybe nothing like this has happened to them or they would be more sensitive
9268711 we believe that we have reached a positive outcome for all parties involved without disruption to our business operations
9268712 i think this storm will prove to be a worse case scenario for the production region
9268713 hyundai had the chance today to show us that it had paid for the licenses then we would have gone but that was not the case they could not prove they had paid so we took the devices away
9268714 this year is the biggest operation that customs investigators have had to carry out
9268715 i will not bow i will not step down and i will not resign despite the pressure mounting on my government
9268716 since the government cannot resolve the problem even the courts cannot resolve the problem the joint session of parliament is the best choice for finding a solution
9268717 if people cant chuck up a job things have come to a pretty pass
9268718 the conspiracy has now reached arizona phillip joll will perform rigoletto at the arizona

9268722 one was a cluster of nails that were sharpened at both ends and they were fastened in the center it looked like they were welded or soldered she said these were good for throwing or putting underneath tires
9268723 what bill ayers did forty years ago has nothing to do with
9268724 those of us who grew up in middle class neighborhoods like scranton and wilmington
9268725 sen joseph r biden accepted the vice presidential nomination of the democratic party with a speech that harkened back to his working class roots in scranton
9268726 he was working as a sales representative for amoco oil co in harrisburg
9268727 biden also was an executive in a boston based company that supplied waterproof sealant for u s merchant marine ships built during world war ii after the war he co owned an airport and crop dusting service on long island
9268728 worked in the state first as a sales manager for auto dealerships and later in real estate condominium sales
9268729 the most elegantly dressed perfectly manicured perfectly tailored car sales manager wilmington del had ever seen
9268730 the government and people of china on their unprecedented effort and success in hosting the historic olympic games in beijing
9268731 a victory for china spectacularly successful games may empower communist leaders
9268732 granted its not as if every area of disagreement has simply melted away instead the olympics provided a way for china and the international community to come together and to begin to find common ground
9268733 the ioc is extremely pleased with the organization of the games
9268734 china has opened for the world to learn all about china and china all about the world
9268735 for the first time foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
9268736 the democrats cant win the presidency without pennsylvanias electoral votes
9268737 the fact that all three sen bob casey rep patrick murphy and scranton native joe biden are white catholics with working class backgrounds
9268738 piuttosto che darti la copertina ci metto il cane rex
9268739 i will not raise taxes on the people of california
9268740 look i cut to the chase i know what the democrats like and i know what the republicans like so i say lets meet somewhere in the middle
9268741 barack obama and i took very different journeys to this destination but we share a common story
9268742 white house confidential the little book of weird presidential history
9268743 im trying to get ahead and get the guy out
9268744 i knew i couldnt give up much i always go out there like the game is close it keeps me on my game
9268745 now if you have additional information peak date plateau duration urr etc you could use a more complex model such as the one used by robelius in his phd thesis im currently working on a more complex model
9268746 tell people something they know already and they will thank you for it tell them something new and they will hate you for it
9268747 in news the rule is that liberals will watch the news and conservatives will watch conservative news a liberal will watch to see what you think the conservative will watch to see how much you agree with him this is why the headline world is so far to the right even of the content
9268748 the sneakiest form of literary subtlety in a corrupt society is to speak the plain truth the critics will not understand you the public will not believe you your fellow writers will shake their heads
9268749 the people of have been led in into a trap from which it will be hard to escape with dignity and honour they have been tricked into it by a steady withholding of information the communiques are belated insincere incomplete things have been far worse than we have been told our administration more bloody and inefficient that the public knows we are today not far from a disaster
9268750 the juicy stories keep popping out like clowns from a clown car
9268751 why dont they talk about the issues were fighting for our lives here
9268752 actions taken in accordance with this chapter do not for any purpose constitute suicide assisted suicide mercy killing or homicide under the law
9268753 the act or an instance of taking ones own life voluntarily and intentionally especially by a person of years of discretion and of sound mind
9268754 only file required reports about 80 2 of the time
9268755 76 1 of these cases physicians said that they had not perceived their act as the ending of life
9268756 both allows assisted suicide and tries to ration health care
9268757 my personal position is that if we believe that there is a right to life then we must accept that people have a right to dispose of that life whenever they want
9268758 nitschke has not limited his death counseling to the terminally ill a case in point involved nancy crick who made headlines when she announced on australian television that she would commit assisted suicide because she had terminal cancer when her autopsy showed she was cancer free however nitschke admitted that he and crick had known all along that she wasnt dying nevertheless he deemed that medical fact irrelevant because she wanted to die
9268759 i thought i put together a good at bat everything was great except the result
9268760 its nice to do the little things and get a win out of it instead of battling and coming up short
9268761 lets not get caught up with the names and lose the aims
9268762 i started looking at the ddg 1000 it has a lot of technology but it cannot perform broader integrated air and missile defense
9268763 submarines can get very close and it does not have the ability to take on that threat
9268764 if you go back from the end of vietnam to our present time we have only shot about a thousand bullets
9268765 and i look at the world and i see proliferation of missiles i see proliferation of submarines and that is what we have to deal with
9268766 it will be another ship with which to demonstrate the technologies
9268767 but it still will lack the capabilities that i think will be in increased demand in the future
9268768 how is it possible the navy could spend a decade developing a multibillion dollar destroyer then suddenly discover the design is not suitable for its future needs
9268769 would see very little of the real john f kennedy and would never fully sense the kennedy cynicism and toughness
9268770 i am just glad i am not involved in that decision
9268771 as soon as i saw it i hit it and i knew it was going to be gone and i was happy
9268772 in that fashion its even worse but we win as a team and we lose as a team we had some chances
9268773 in my 34 year career i have never wavered from the notion that the only time progress has ever been made in the middle east is when the arab nations have known that there is no daylight between us and israel
9268774 biden said that the best deterrent to prevent pre emptive military action n iran is to make it clear even if it is at the end of bushs final term action will be taken against bush to ensure his legacy will be marred for all time
9268775 seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for 200 million to iran
9268776 the current party or raid member becomes the target of your tricks of the trade the threat caused by your next attack and all actions taken for 6 sec afterwards will be transferred to the target in addition all damage caused by the target is increased by 15 during this time

9268780 im proud of what my dad and my mother did and what they built and left me and i intend to carry their legacy as long as i can
9268781 the fact that john mccain does not know how many houses he owns when millions are struggling to stay in the only house they have shows hes out of touch with the lives of real americans
9268782 mccain is promising to double down on the economic policies of george w bush which have benefited corporations and ceos while leaving middle class families behind john mccain just doesnt get it
9268783 the issue here isnt the wealth of the mccain family its that senator mccain is out of touch when he says that the fundamentals of our economy are strong and that the bush economy has made great progress when most americans are actually losing ground
9268784 a street parade to exhibit to the public the strength and esprit de corps of the trade and labor organizations of the community followed by a festival for the recreation and amusement of the workers and their families

9268787 no ones gonna take me alive the time has come to make things right
9268788 let me tell you the reason i picked joe biden
9268789 number three is somebody who i know in his heart cares about the american people and the american dream and is willing to fight for them as hard as he can and joe biden fit that bill
9268790 what do you think of senator mccains vice presidential choice and how does it change the dynamics of this campaign
9268791 well i dont know governor palin i have not met her before i had a brief conversation with her after she was selected to congratulate her and wish her luck but not too much luck on the campaign trial and she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and a up and coming public servant
9268792 so its too early for me to gauge what kind of running mate shell be
9268793 my sense is that she subscribes to john mccains agenda and ultimately this election is going to be about where i want to take the country and where joe biden wants to take the country and where john mccain and his running mate want to take the country
9268794 retailer amazon has listed tentative dates and platforms for star wars battlefront iii long rumored to be in development at free radical developers of haze and timesplitters while weve been under the impression that the uk based dev was hard at work we didnt know how hard at work they are according to amazon battlefront iii is coming to everything wii xbox 360 playstation 3 ds psp playstation 2 ok not everything since it doesnt list a pc version but if these listings are accurate anyone and everyone will have access to a version of the game come march 2009 we await more news at e3 next week

9268798 check back at the end of this month to find out more
9268799 using the power of the government to settle scores with estranged relatives or associates is far from unprecedented but i doubt very much that they were prepared for the heat of full bore national media scrutiny on this one and in this case you not only the underlying act which is sleazy but the high probability that palin is lying about her role
9268800 ive been there before through college i scored a few goals
9268801 i had him with the u s under 20 team and saw him quite a bit in college
9268802 i felt at that time in the draft when he was still available he was a good athlete i didnt know what position he was going to play because he was a forward in college and in the under 20s i played him at center back a little bit and outside back eventually i figured he would end up somewhere in the midfield
9268803 i also played right back at the under 20 championships i think i even played left back at one time its good it puts you on the field but you like to find your niche center mid is where ill be playing
9268804 i look at this as my rookie year because i was healthy for about two months total
9268805 im looking at this as a fresh start and blessed to be healthy right now youre healthy all through college you get a shot and youre all excited you come in and things happen you work hard to get back i didnt touch a ball until january im super happy to be healthy
9268806 the way we play im going to be up high with a lot of mobility working side to side in order for us to create some spaces there has to be some second runs from either guillermo barros schelotto or the midfielders and weve been getting that
9268807 as you see when we get that from brad or brian carroll theyre usually open at the top of the box with late runs if we get good balls into them theyve got a good chance to score theyre taking advantage of the opportunities
9268808 he always scored goals in college hes had that capability hes good in the air he strikes the ball well
9268809 im not surprised by his scoring he and adam moffat and carroll and the outside midfielders have given us goals thats important to the offense
9268810 with guillermo dropping off the front line a little bit and the outside forwards really getting into the attack the defensive attention is on those four guys and sometimes the fifth guy is coming in weve talked a lot about not getting in in advance of the play coming in late its a lot harder for the defense to pick you up if youre running toward the box late if youre there early they can sort it out
9268811 if the service is there hopefully ill be there you always hope for goals but if they dont come no problem theres next week
9268812 i think ive found my niche in the middle i guess its a little knack for scoring and for me to get some points
9268813 we have four wins now so our goal this weekend is to get more wins than we did last year
9268814 we want to get points every time weve accomplished our goal of getting in 21 games as many points as we had last year so our next goal is to qualify for the playoffs then the next goal after that is to get the best positioning as possible in the playoffs
9268815 its normal for the home team to be a little more pumped up
9268816 the best we can weve tried to bring that attitude on the road things are different you have to deal with travel and hotels and eating different foods thats why away games are little more difficult
9268817 its difficult to play on the road and at times you dont commit as many people forward because other teams are committing forward weve been able to find key goals at key moments
9268818 our philosophy is the same on the road as it is at home
9268819 the one benefit we have is were a pretty decent counterattacking team eddie gavens speed is a little underrated and obviously robbie rogers has great speed so were pretty good coming out of the back like that guillermos barros schelotto pretty good at pulling strings on counters
9268820 we know going on the road weve had good results and overcome some adversity
9268821 its another opportunity to continue the good run were in were now in first place so we have to find a way to stay there and get separation from the rest of the group
9268822 that game was a typical tale of two halves thats soccer sometimes
9268823 even though we were down a goal at halftime we knew we didnt play well in the first half there was a sense in the locker room that were going to win the game the second half was a good display of soccer
9268824 we did what we needed to do thats been our theme this year sometimes when were not playing the best of soccer we know that and come out harder the second half thats a reason why we come back so much
9268825 teams have to respect that a little bit when youre playing certain teams you know their record away from home
9268826 we knew salt lake was 1 8 1 or whatever they were typically theyre not good away from home so we wanted to pounce on them right away and we did that
9268827 teams have a little more respect for us when we play them there because weve done pretty well on the road the coaches know our record and the players do too theyre probably saying hey this is a good road team they may have to change their game plan a little bit when theyre at home that just helps us out
9268828 weve made it a thing to win the season series we can do that with a point in dallas
9268829 were not scared of anyone we believe going in that we can win every game and thats how we approach every game
9268830 thought you might be interested in that the official nintendo magazine uk have a six page review of the force unleashed in their latest edition 34 october 2008 i enclose their verdict summary score and some choice words they have given to the force unleashed on the wii
9268831 the game punishes you by making sure that simply flicking the remote down all the time never leads to any smooth lightsaber combat as a result it forces you to mix your swings to make combat flow better this may seem like bad game design but in fact its a clever way of forcing the player to feel more like theyre actually fighting with a lightsaber
9268832 theres a great sense of power felt when you can avoid fighting someone on cloud city if you simply use the force to pick them up and fling them off the edge of a platform
9268833 the main highlight for us is lifting the enemy up with the force then throwing our lightsaber at them impaling them as they float in the air

9268835 dying has effectively no impact on your progress if you die you simply respawn at the last checkpoint and all the enemies you killed remain dead
9268836 instead of tactically planning how youre going to enter a room the temptations too strong to simply jump in there get stuck in kill a few of them die then jump back in and kill the rest
9268837 what disappointed us more was what happened about six hours into the game it ended

9268857 senator mccains choice for a running mate is beyond belief by choosing sarah palin mccain has clearly made a decision to continue the bush legacy of destructive environmental policies
9268858 sarah palin whose husband works for bp has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment in her scant two years as governor she has lobbied aggressively to open up the arctic national wildlife refuge to drilling pushed for more drilling off of alaskas coasts and put special interests above science ms palin has made it clear through her actions that she is unwilling to do even as much as the bush administration to address the impacts of global warming her most recent effort has been to sue the u s fish and wildlife service to remove the polar bear from the endangered species list putting big oil before sound science as unbelievable as this may sound this actually puts her to the right of the bush administration
9268859 this is senator mccains first significant choice in building his executive team and its a bad one it has to raise serious doubts in the minds of voters about john mccains commitment to conservation to addressing the impacts of global warming and to ensuring our country ends its dependency on oil

9268881 as people started talking about the new hurricane i was thinking this cant be happening again
9268882 we already lived through this i dont know if we can do this again
9268883 they are concerned about that kind of destruction happening again and how it might postpone graduation or affect their careers down the line
9268884 so im kind of just waiting for it to do what it has to do so i can get back to school
9268885 how could we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9268886 i dont know why some people have children at all if they know that they can only take a few weeks off work
9268887 i know you want a child and you have every right to want a child but does the child want you if you are going to put it in childcare at six weeks
9268888 i dont think the child wants you to tell the honest truth i know thats incredibly controversial
9268889 were going to look back on this time from the late 90s onwards with putting children in childcare so early in their first year of life for such long hours and wonder how we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9268890 its just awful its awful for the mothers as well its completely heartbreaking
9268891 you actually have to say to yourself if i have to work this hard and if im never going to see my kid and if they are going to have a tremendous stress in childcare should i be doing it
9268892 its discrimination against the state of alaska during a time when gas prices are high and we need to look at all options to issue something that shuts off a viable resource
9268893 the amazing thing about this litigation is that the governor of alaska is so anti environmental that she is suing the bush administration over a claimed overabundance of protections for the polar bear
9268894 i think it shows the strength of our legal theory
9268895 basically we said list the polar bear and when you list the polar bear youre going to have to do something about greenhouse gas emissions the fact all these other parties are suing over it shows the bush administration doesnt have a legal leg to stand on they know the administration has to do something about greenhouse gas emissions
9268896 general mckiernan wants to ensure that the numbers can be reconciled somehow so its important that theres cooperation
9268897 its very surprising that the numbers are so disparate we believe that this could be because of some taliban propaganda or misinformation
9268898 we are hopeful that a collaborative inquiry will result in finding out the truth
9268899 but it needs to be broad based and it needs to include all the key players the afghans the u s military nato the united nations
9268900 i think that the main target was somewhere else and as the u s and afghan forces were passing by azizabad on the way to the target they came under attack
9268901 one of the american special forces soldiers was injured and then the special forces called for air support to bombard the village
9268902 i still dont know where the main target was supposed to be and neither does the commander of our commando unit
9268903 suddenly there were large planes above us then they bombed the house
9268904 they bombed and fired from 1 a m to 8 a m all of my relatives were killed in this bombing my cousins my uncles nieces nephews two of my daughters and my son
9268905 it was difficult for us to get to the bodies and to bury them we buried five children in one grave and four children in another grave
9268906 i would not come back except to get what i could salvage that would be enough for me
9268907 we wont stay and thats scary because new orleans would really be in trouble
9268908 i would not come back except to get what i could salvage that would be enough for me
9268909 its kind of a shock i think shes in a little over her head
9268910 but i think of anybody shes the kind of person who can rise to an occasion
9268911 she handles tough questions well its hard to get elected to be a woman and get elected in alaska
9268912 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9268913 i think john mccain won the state of alaska but lost the nation
9268914 i think her inexperience is going to cause many many voters to think twice before voting for him
9268915 think of it as a dinner party thrown by revolutionaries
9268916 good food is not just for the middle class we want to make it accessible
9268917 when you take the time to do things right you are rewarded
9268918 the more you learn the more you realize you dont want to eat a lot of whats being shipped into supermarkets
9268919 i dont want to serve something to my guests that i wont eat myself
9268920 we dont take time to eat and celebrate food were on the run putting things in our body that dont make sense
9268921 this is a very grass roots effort that connects young artists environmentalists and young people all of whom are engaged for their own reason
9268922 we have to meet each other and understand our power as a group
9268923 we havent had a single student turned down for a loan
9268924 is that the college financial aid offices are themselves sort of reeling from various lenders dropping out its difficult for the financial aid offices to keep pace let alone for parents to understand it

9268954 sen john mccains choice of alaska governor sarah palin as his running mate is a cynical effort to appeal to disappointed hillary clinton voters and get them to vote ultimately against their own self interest
9268955 what mccain does not understand is that women supported hillary clinton not just because she was a woman but because she was a champion on their issues they will surely not find sarah palin to be an advocate for women
9268956 finally as the chair of nows political action committee i am frequently asked whether now supports women candidates just because they are women this gives me an opportunity to once again answer that question with an emphatic no we recognize the importance of having womens rights supporters at every level but like sarah palin not every woman supports womens rights

9268987 this is the same mistake that mbeki in his power drunkenness made and we showed him the door
9268988 perhaps the problem is that motlanthe spends too much time with mbeki and is advised by mbeki loyalists such as ebrahim rasool
9268989 the truth is that the youth league and also many of us love motlanthe even when we take pain from him
9268990 in the process they are doing more damage to the anc and to zumas cause it was always bound to happen that at one stage they would lock horns with motlanthe
9268991 these kinds of statements create an impression that the partys leadership is not coherent that its not a cohesive leadership and that is a dangerous message to send out during an election period

9269007 choose again pretend that you are enlightened pretend that you are loved by god pretend that you are perfect just the way you are take a deep breath now and pretend what is true then everything will make sense when you pretend something that is true then you immediately become that truth first the energy of god descends upon the earth then it pretends whatever it wants to be then it ascends back to its source you are god pretending to be whatever you are right now do you understand what this means you have allowed yourself to descend but by pretending to be less than what you are you have not ascended back to god
9269008 non riesco a tenermi tutto questo per me impossibile raccontare le sensazioni che mi accadono riesco solo ad ascoltarle riesco solo a cammini paralleli per altri cieli

9269011 i would do a cat scan but thats a ton of radiation in your eye oh well lets do it
9269012 securing that status will generate significant potential not just in cultural terms but in terms of tourism and will present a good opportunity to combine the exploitation of that potential with the 2014 commonwealth games i shall do everything i can to ensure that all these objectives and opportunities are exploited fully for my own part i have already written to the committee to express the support of the scotland office and the uk government at that level for this bid
9269013 this is a very exciting opportunity for scotland in 2003 the government endorsed the working up of a formal bid for world heritage status for the antonine wall and in 2007 the nomination was submitted to unesco as an extension of the frontiers of the roman empire transnational world heritage site between 2 and 10 july in quebec a decision will be made by the world heritage committee
9269014 one third of the antonine wall runs through falkirk district starting from borrowstounness or boness in my constituency and passing through camelon where the most northerly fort of the roman empire roughcastle is well preserved will he join me in praising the work of falkirk council and in particular the chair of the cultural committee adrian mahoney who has made this his priority for scotland can the secretary of state assure us that the resources of the uk government will be put together with the efforts of falkirk to ensure that this is delivered as a unesco world heritage site in 2008
9269015 i have no difficulty in commending falkirk council on the work that it has done in 1999 it secured lottery funding to improve the infrastructure and it continues to discuss with the heritage lottery fund not only how to exploit the tourism potential but the restoration and maintenance of the sites as indeed do other councils my hon friend can rest assured that not only the united kingdom government but the austrian and german governments who are also involved in this international bid will put all the resources necessary behind it to secure this important status
9269016 boness people are very proud of their heritage from our roman roots to the towns important role during the industrial revolution for a small town boness played a crucial role in the heritage of this country and it would be a great honour for the antonine wall to become the uks next world heritage site i really hope this bid is successful as it will bring tourists to boness and the surrounding area
9269017 this this performance is what i expect from the team but were only about 60 70 of where we want to be
9269018 but an opportunity for the players to showcase their talents
9269019 when the guys put it together somebody would get a beating
9269020 there has been plenty of criticism but it shows that the process is now beginning to work
9269021 of course we were disappointed after the two defeats but one becomes better if you can get through the tough times together
9269022 one never comes to a field expecting that kind of score to be put past you
9269023 all credit to the boks every time they created they used the opportunities and every time we were turned over they punished us
9269024 we will rather focus on what is a great opportunity for us

9269030 you can also find coins in each level which can be spent to skip any areas you find too extreme
9269031 thats an odd design choice ymm mentioned on the forums that collecting coins was a way to challenge players who might otherwise find the levels too easy i dont understand why youd want to make it difficult to lower the difficulty for players frustrated by the difficulty you know

9269066 in mijn omgeving zijn er wat dingen gebeurd en dat vind ik vervelend zelf heb ik er niets van ervaren
9269067 i didnt think in spring training that id be part of anything like that
9269068 i wanted to but i didnt think it was a possibility sometimes you get things that you dont expect so it was nice
9269069 i know that everybody feels especially happy for him he looks really comfortable out there and i like that
9269070 im always proud of a walk i love walks thats my mantra
9269071 and i showed them today i was talking about that in the batting cage today me and milledge i told him a walk is as good as a hit
9269072 okay er is blijkbaar sprake van verkeerde beeldvorming op punten maar de taak is aan jullie om te beseffen dat die idee n wel zijn gaan postvatten bij menigeen en dat jullie die idee n zelf moeten trachten recht te zetten
9269073 en bovendien blijven er dan nog genoeg andere punten over waarover we het k of vooral moeten hebben graag jullie aandacht voor het volgende
9269074 we knew what we were going to open with when we scheduled the game
9269075 we wanted to take a team that is in a league of their own in college football theyve certainly proven that in the last six years
9269076 we could put all types of psychological interpretations on it but sometimes bad plays are just bad plays
9269077 we can go into the next one and say they were way better than us and thats why we lost
9269078 but there were also times when our execution just needed to be better there were times we had a lot of open guys out there i should of hit and there were times when we could have turned the thing around
9269079 to be honest as far as the plays and the things they did we knew what was going to happen
9269080 thats why its so disappointing we knew what was going to happen but they were still able to out execute us losing by 40 odd points is very humbling it lets us know exactly where we are as a team
9269081 i want to thank special teams coach danny smith for the three years he gave me here and i feel like he always treated me well and i will continue to think that but i think we all know who made the decision and when youve got a draft that isnt starting to look so good youre going to do whatever you can to make it look as good as possible
9269082 we appreciate all the effort and hard work that these players gave to us during the offseason program and the preseason
9269083 these final cuts are always a very difficult decision because we had a lot of quality football players in our training camp we hope the opportunity presents itself to enable us to sign a number of these players to our practice squad
9269084 this will be a challenge for our team and itll be interesting to see how they respond
9269085 well have to keep working hard this week and correct our mistakes
9269086 they have a great young team and do a good job of playing together
9269087 i think they have a good mixture of youth and vets
9269088 i supported the maryland stakes races and everything im unhappy i have to go to bowie most of my help lives north of baltimore
9269089 i love maryland racing id like to be in maryland the facilities are better theyre good for my horses its a shame maryland has such a great racing tradition
9269090 the other horse had her beat at the end crystal has got this filly right and shes all heart
9269091 the mystique of saratoga and the graveyard of champions works into your head
9269092 the biggest hurdle is just getting over the fact that you were out a little bit because of stuff going on in your shoulder
9269093 were going to see how it reacts and the way it has been is good hopefully ill have an opportunity to get in there soon
9269094 unfortunately i think i made a bad decision of trying to play through some inflammation in my knee and it has cost me and cost the team a couple of games
9269095 when im healthy im going to get a lot of people out
9269096 i dont want to back down i want to keep going but you have to look at the best interests of the team
9269097 these guys got a bad rap a few weeks ago for what happened but they dont deserve it
9269098 this one means a lot these guys have had a lot of adversity on them the past few weeks
9269099 i think the biggest challenge was just being good on the restarts and getting away
9269100 nobody was going to touch that no 18 those guys were scary fast it was a lot of fun but he was in a different zip code
9269101 tomorrow will be ours weve won two in a row and i believe our car will be real good
9269102 ill tell you one thing you enjoy winning you kidding me
9269103 ill kick their butt tomorrow well get up tomorrow and learn those lessons
9269104 were better than that and we cant make the mistakes we made and get behind a team of that caliber and expect to be able to come back
9269105 weve got fast receivers on the outside and we took advantage of it
9269106 its a scary moment when an impact player like that goes down
9269107 im enjoying the challenge and im delighted to still have a sniff
9269108 ollies favourite but ill see if i can make him sweat a bit
9269109 its a big day the culmination of a years worth of golf comes down to one day
9269110 i played wonderfully on saturday and made nothing the longest putt was the five footer on the last

9269121 we have suspended the agitation for the time being and not called it off as some of our demands are yet to be met
9269122 general mckiernan wants to ensure that the numbers can be reconciled somehow so its important that theres cooperation
9269123 its very surprising that the numbers are so disparate we believe that this could be because of some taliban propaganda or misinformation
9269124 we are hopeful that a collaborative inquiry will result in finding out the truth
9269125 but it needs to be broad based and it needs to include all the key players the afghans the u s military nato the united nations
9269126 i think that the main target was somewhere else and as the u s and afghan forces were passing by azizabad on the way to the target they came under attack
9269127 one of the american special forces soldiers was injured and then the special forces called for air support to bombard the village
9269128 i still dont know where the main target was supposed to be and neither does the commander of our commando unit
9269129 suddenly there were large planes above us then they bombed the house
9269130 they bombed and fired from 1 a m to 8 a m all of my relatives were killed in this bombing my cousins my uncles nieces nephews two of my daughters and my son
9269131 it was difficult for us to get to the bodies and to bury them we buried five children in one grave and four children in another grave
9269132 ive had enough kidnapping corrupt police a rotten judicial system
9269133 were desperate weve been fighting for five years we want an answer
9269134 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive maybe nothing like this has happened to them or they would be more sensitive

9269401 there are basic qualities of energy that compose life on earth which are in turn reflected in the chemistry of material existence humans are composed of all those basic qualities of energy found in every species on earth the two most abused beliefs by humans are that humans have dominion over all species and survival of the fittest species the unremarkable intelligence that springs from those simplistic notions is creating your own armageddon your role as steward has been usurped by your pride as being superior your role as spiritual leader has been sabotaged by your fear of spirit without a turnaround in these conditions you will have to experience the consequences of these beliefs carried to their natural conclusion
9269402 you are not punished for your sins as you are by them and the same for your virtues in that youre not rewarded for them as you are by living them
9269403 hmmm sounds like you want to draw me into the highly charged controversy over this film
9269404 im not inclined to pose as a film critic but i am inclined to speak about the content and subject matter in a way that can shed some light
9269405 there are a few things that must be said at the onset of this conversation im as present today in the world as i was 2000 years ago i serve among the masters in world service to humanity the record of my ministry is incomplete and at times incorrect owing to the great number of interpretations through which it has passed nevertheless the essence of peace and love remains the focal point for all who will embrace the teachings the records of the life and times of humanity during those days are also incomplete and at times incorrect owing to the authors bias and inability of present day people to grasp the cultural mores of the time there is much scholarly and layman speculation on the missing parts a natural and admirable intent to make complete the story and an understanding of history
9269406 it is natural for humanity to desire familiarity with their religious icons by interpreting the messages as best as they can naturally in that process there will be disagreement about the interpretations when the level of disagreement reaches the point of personal and group acrimony then it has moved beyond serving humanity and begins to destroy the fabric of unity among all beings unfortunately the discussion over this current film has been divisive to that degree among some groups however we can note that some groups have bridged gaps in their relationships as a result of examining the meaning of this film
9269407 then they shouldnt see the film seeing the film has nothing whatsoever to do with understanding the message i brought to humanity then and that ive brought through the intervening periods of time and into the present it is merely a creative expression of the filmmakers and their interpretation of certain events
9269408 this is a misunderstanding that arises from the causes i mentioned earlier namely incomplete and incorrect reporting of my teachings and of history itself let me strip away the word evil and present a new word to describe what is meant by it ignorance coupled with fear produces what is referred to as evil scholars have devoted much time and energy to defining evil the term itself has become too emotionally charged to accurately reflect a meaning that can be applied to human behavior if it can be used to describe a political regime religious leaders or a serial murderer then its meaning has become too broad i offer a way out of this labeling to look upon a group or individual whose actions appear horrific to you and label them evil no longer suffices the labeling as such shows a lack of comprehension on the part of the one applying the label to label someone in a way that separates him from you destroys the fabric of unity in the same way i mentioned earlier to default to that label implies ignorance of the one labeling and a signal that hatred has sprung from ignorance and fear you can see the vicious cycle ignorance fear hatred separation and destruction evil is in the eye of the beholder where hatred is present one will see evil but i tell you it is already in the heart of the one producing the label
9269409 society can and must define codes of conduct consistent with freedom for all it is not necessary to label one evil in order to create a just society what you asked in the previous question relates more specifically to a problem of labeling an individual or group as evil in order to justify all sorts of acts of retribution toward them do you not think for moment that i didnt choose my death the sadducees played their role as did the romans and as did all connected with me it was my choice to allow that to happen the way that it did no one was evil in my eyes because i love them all i see into their hearts and minds and know them well i am their elder brother and know their mistakes and love them still why would you do less in my name
9269410 the film itself is not important as i stated earlier it is a representative view of that time and those events by filmmakers it provokes discussion that could occur with or without the film it provokes emotions that already exist it provokes ancient prejudice and guilt that already exist the film doesnt need to do these things but it does because of the subject matter and what is in place around it the subject has been contentious on so many levels for so long now that it doesnt take much to provoke an outcry
9269411 the jews didnt kill me anymore than the romans did that will be confusing to many who wish to pin the blame on someone so that they can seek justice in the form of revenge again this isnt necessary in my name and im the one presumably wronged here so my wishes must be weighed the longstanding enmity between christians and jews over this episode is unnecessary jews are reluctant to drop their defense and christians are holding on to a grievance that isnt true
9269412 i had a plan when i came into physical life just like every human being before me and since i carried out my plan just as every being before me and since i was consciously aware of my plan in the flesh nevertheless i faced the same obstacles as every being namely staying in my conscious awareness the greatest test for me was in my final hours before my death in physical form could i remain conscious of who i am and what my purpose is on this earth isnt that true for every being those who judged me acted out their own conscious awareness their ignorance and their fear filtered their judgment and prevented them from embracing me and my teachings just as it has done since and that it is now for the vast majority of beings will you judge your ancient brothers for their acts and claim yourself to be free of ignorance and fear my mission and purpose is not complete until i can demonstrate to humanity the strength of love and wisdom and the power of conscious awareness it is judgment that has been and will be your downfall forever will you remain separate from one another it is worse that you take part of my teachings and use it to condemn your fellow beings it is better that you take all or nothing
9269413 and to let go of judgment of yourself which is equally important
9269414 it doesnt matter in the sense that you think you have to judge others and avenge my death in the flesh to do that is to oppose everything i represent
9269415 because people think its important to be right right in their point of view right in their understanding of reality right in their relationship to me and to god being right often means making others wrong its that simple on the surface but runs much deeper on racial hatred or religious intolerance not only is it important to be right but one must also weave a measure of justice into the arrangement by punishing those who are wrong it doesnt have to be this way there is a movement among the enlightened teachers of all religions to put aside dogmatic differences and embrace the oneness of all faiths while still practicing the rituals of each
9269416 i once encountered a monk who delivered the most eloquent and beautiful sermon on the virtue of humor he told of his journey to a foreign land and of his many blunders with language and custom his audience was all smiles and laughs as they recognized themselves in each anecdote why cant we have that acceptance about religion is it somehow more important than its adherents there is a problem here that goes deeper than offense at irreverence there is a problem that a man can only resolve by finding his true spiritual nature through a religion that he so identifies with that he has the strength and the courage to laugh at himself and his religion occasionally life is experience and religion is also experience this means that it must be accepted as fallible and in need of evolution man must not guard it as if it is a treasure that belongs only to him and is so fragile that it will break at the slightest injury religion is a living thing it is nurtured in the way all living things are nurtured it must learn and to learn it must not take too seriously what it already thinks it knows otherwise there is no room for new insights without new insights how is it to grow and learn and allow for nurturance
9269417 life is experience and religion is also experience religion is a living thing it must learn and to learn it must not take too seriously what it already thinks it knows otherwise there is no room for new insights
9269418 so im going to make one out of this iron bar
9269419 look at the trouble people give themselves over things that are totally absurd you are doing something really valuable spiritual practice and youre not nearly so dedicated
9269420 this rock is so big its stopping the sun from shining on my house so im trying to get rid of it
9269421 it is not true that i have never appeared to you before but your negative karma and obscurations prevented you from seeing me
9269422 we coordinate very much in the same way you on the physical plane would coordinate such an effort but without the politics of egos and fear we meet on a regular basis to discuss our respective plans and we identify areas that we can focus on together to bring about specific results that accomplish our respective goals please remember that we follow a plan that has been created by beings who are the creators of this world so in that sense we are working within a general framework that has anticipated many of the variables that exist today and has also provided many of the solutions for us to follow there is a range of experimentation though and that is how we learn
9269423 it is written that our dna is many strands short of what was originally intended for
9269424 key findings in our survey of the luxury market demonstrates that the typical million dollar homeowner is invested not only in the value of their home as a current part of their portfolios but also see long term gains coming from this investment
9269425 its interesting to note that while 44 percent of those surveyed indicated they plan to stay in their primary residence for at least 10 years they also dream of owning the perfect home
9269426 approximately two years ago in the fall of 2006 another major tax certiorari lawsuit filed by the mirant power corp against the north rockland school district and the towns of haverstraw and stony point and rockland county was unfolding the facts of mirants suit were very similar to the dynegy suit
9269427 like dynegy the mirant corporation had two generating plants on its property and sought a 90 percent reduction in assessed valuation
9269428 this decision had two prongs first the assessed value of the plant was reduced going forward into 2007 and the future shifting the burden from mirant to local property owners second the value of the power plants was reduced going backward seven years resulting in a refund to be paid by the north rockland school district of over 220 million
9269429 funding schools by property taxes has to change it is unfair archaic and it rips communities apart
9269430 were going to be getting phone calls and its not pleasant
9269431 its the last week in august where are the majority of the people the community has to start coming and complain
9269432 everybody complains but nobody comes i always show up everybody leaves it for the next guy
9269433 the outrageous thing is when i pay my taxes i kid with them and they say that they will lower the assessments when the when the real estate prices go down
9269434 approximately two years ago in the fall of 2006 another major tax certiorari lawsuit filed by the mirant power corp against the north rockland school district and the towns of haverstraw and stony point and rockland county was unfolding the facts of mirants suit were very similar to the dynegy suit
9269435 like dynegy the mirant corporation had two generating plants on its property and sought a 90 percent reduction in assessed valuation
9269436 this decision had two prongs first the assessed value of the plant was reduced going forward into 2007 and the future shifting the burden from mirant to local property owners second the value of the power plants was reduced going backward seven years resulting in a refund to be paid by the north rockland school district of over 220 million
9269437 over a two year period the impact of this settlement resulted in a nearly 100 percent increase in taxes for the north rockland school district residents although the marlboro district is three to four times smaller than the north rockland school district the circumstances of the mirant corporations and dynegys lawsuits were very similar
9269438 in addition dynegys lawsuit was to be heard by the same state supreme court judge in white plains that rendered the mirant decision
9269439 the marlboro central school district and its taxpayers faced a very difficult situation with dynegy especially with the mirant power plant decision just unfolding
9269440 while the increase the district is facing in 2008 2009 is extremely large it is nowhere near the devastating impact that north rockland experienced nevertheless the district and the board of education are very sensitive to the burden faced by our residents and property owners and is working very hard to operate efficiently and in a cost effective manner
9269441 up to this point before the dynegy settlement marlboro had the third lowest true tax rate in the combined three counties of ulster orange and sullivan
9269442 in our meeting we discussed how now with dynegys new assessment marlboro is right in par with other local communities on taxable rates that is to say a home in marlboro worth 225 000 now pays a tax of 3 596 after star its 2 898 and with enhanced star its 2 275 that same home assessed at 225 000 in wallkill is 3 492 and after star 2 828 and with advanced star 2 273
9269443 the role of religion is to share this common knowledge by way of a social support and educational network through the human epoch of living as savage beasts to dining in a restaurant there is much suffering and challenge along the way religious organizations are educational first and foremost in intent that they have been corrupted in that aim is not sufficient reason to abandon the concept the first thing that humans do when they reject religious organizations is form another one in contrast to the one they rejected there is nothing inherently wrong with religious organizations as an educational facility there is something wrong in the clergy inserting themselves as the gatekeepers for all that is holy and righteous let them stand down and reclaim their roles as leaders and custodians of an institution of learning and comfort

9269448 i have never seen a stranger yet more majestic looking creature
9269449 last year we went to seaworld san diego and saw michaels female counterpart michelle and even though the show was a little funnier than this one nothing compares to watching michael almost hover over the water after launching his trainer into the air

9269454 coloro che hanno la fortuna di pregustare in vita la felicit eterna e sono ben pochi provano qualcosa che assomiglia molto alla follia dicono cose incoerenti parlano in modo diverso dagli altri uomini servendosi d espressioni che esulano dallumana ragione i loro volti assumono le insolite fattezze a tratti allegri a tratti abbattuti piangono ridono sospirano insomma sn fuori di s e quando tornano a ragionare nn vogliono sapere che cosa successo se sn stati in s o fuori d s se hanno dormito o erano svegli nn ricordano nulla d ci che hanno detto fatto visto o sentito se nn cm in sogno attraverso una cortina di nebbia d una cosa sola sn certi quella parentesi di pazzia li ha colmati di felicit rimpiangono d esser tornati in s e desiderano ardentemente che quella fugace mancanza di senno si prolunghi allinfinito eppure nn era stato che un assaggio della felicit eterna

9269461 wow you really nailed me highly gifted lady that sees clearly thank u so much
9269462 an amazing spiritual reading one of the best i have received ever great talent
9269463 the bottom line is i dont condone the lifestyle and what they were asking me to do in my official capacity as mayor was to issue a proclamation which in essence endorsed the gay lifestyle if i had issued such a proclamation i would in essence be saying that gods position is wrong and i wouldnt dare take a position against god

9269466 from coked out disco like studio 54 to the extremely shiny and polished mega club of l a and vegas to the dirty wanna be mega clubs of s f and n y c to the ghetto small clubs all over america and they are all keeping the underground music alive they are all under attack and are all going down hill but all for different reasons a detailed examination of everything government policies local state federal music trends music industry trends mindset of clubbers and so forth would easily fill a large book
9269467 we like that in los angeles there is already enough pollution in the world there is no sense in inhaling it while you are out dancing does everyone feel this way not really but for those who want to smoke there is always an area out back or around the side even those visiting from someplace else will make comments but when you get home and you dont smell like smoke most people are usually thankful
9269468 the major issue that dictates club life here in atlanta is the closing times most clubs used to stay open until approximately 5 in the morning there were even a few 24 hour establishments this has been abolished for about a year now most late night partiers are now forced to organize private parties
9269469 in los angles drinking really stops at last call around 1 30 in the morning which causes the frustrating power drinking hour only to be kicked out between 1 30 a m and 2 a m with nowhere else to go except to search for the few after hours that may or may not be happening on any given night
9269470 and thats why clubbing in the u s a sux as only a few clubs can afford to stay open and these are mostly the shitty mainstream clubs that dont even want electronic music and when they do its crappy has beens like jokenfold
9269471 when the permits were cheap many clubs were open and there was competition the clubs with the best music had the most people there was competition to have the newest and best djs this is how disco was born and subsequently how house music spread so quickly now that isnt possible and there is hardly any underground scene happening
9269472 tons of policemen would have to deal with tons of people getting into fights and beating each other up and causing all sorts of trouble
9269473 the club did not last more than a couple of months for a few reasons
9269474 1 even though we wanted to continue operating until four oclock in the morning the house security would get tired and actually start shutting us down earlier 2 the house security would not let us turn the bass up much out of concern that people in the area of sunset strip would complain this was a club zone 3 the club owner was worried that people would not buy drinks because electronic music was synonymous with drug use
9269475 san francisco like new york has become filled with nightclubs catering to the weekend party monsters from outside the city
9269476 they come in for friday and saturday and spend 30 cover charge and drink themselves silly in my opinion it is killing u s clubbing
9269477 no local wants to get bullied pushed and be a part of these masses as they are not classy are not fun or sexy and dont bring much to the table
9269478 the dance club has changed into the stand around and look pretty club attitudes about going out and having a blast have been trumped by trying to look too cute and cool this attitude change is not just a symptom of club life it is a reflection of u s culture we have become obsessed with style minus substance this is most apparent in the club scene
9269479 i believe that in the future clubs will become more corporately influenced

9269488 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9269489 as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need
9269490 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9269491 america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9269492 an outstanding choice that should be extremely reassuring to the conservative base
9269493 gives us confidence he will keep his pledges to voters regarding the kinds of justices he would nominate to the supreme court
9269494 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges shes the complete package
9269495 the question is how this will be received by a lot of rank and file evangelicals who are just americans struggling along going to their megachurches and care about values
9269496 mccain is saying to social and religious conservatives im taking your views incredibly seriously
9269497 but i definitely dont like mccain because of the eight years with bush well see
9269498 i need you to stand up beside me and say now is the time to bring about change in america
9269499 everyone here is pro coal thats what the economy is built on
9269500 everything i hear he seems to be more anti coal
9269501 all hes going to do is raise your taxes spend spend spend
9269502 anything hes going to do is going to enlarge government and raise taxes to support larger government
9269503 theres probably not been enough money printed to support his plans
9269504 i remember him talking about her when he came back
9269505 he said she was an impressive woman he liked her
9269506 he was down to the point that if the meeting had gone well and it was expected to go well there was going to be an offer
9269507 i dont think he would have invited her if it werent his intention to offer her the job
9269508 discussions strengths and weaknesses of all the candidates he asked a lot of questions and listened didnt tip his hand to too many of us he was very insistent that this process often wounds people and we were to stay very quiet
9269509 we obviously were looking at a lot of different options
9269510 we looked at base options women pro choice pro life people outside the party it was a very broad and deep search most of the people we checked out never made it into the public domain and some speculated on were very very competitive for the job
9269511 its a little naive on the part of the media to assume because they werent reporting this palins consideration for the last few months theres something up on this we didnt spend any time saying yes or no to any of the speculation just because everyone thought it was going to be mitt romney for a month and then it was going to be joe lieberman for a month
9269512 shes got an ability that far exceeds her tenure in office

9269515 our organization will continue we will be on the streets
9269516 we spent so much time trying to welcome people to the city and now this is the way we start out
9269517 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9269518 and it is warm not something im really used to
9269519 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9269520 can be a distraction in these kinds of situations so we want to make sure that were monitoring the situation and that were being useful
9269521 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9269522 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9269523 can step in and become president and i dont think anybody has any doubt about that
9269524 counsel and advice of somebody whos not going to agree with me 100 percent of the time
9269525 but for the rest of us theres still no change
9269526 we plan to start when were going to start and end when were going to end
9269527 right now it appears to have restored a leaner version
9269528 im not sure when well have it back up the way it was
9269529 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven to just have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river

9269537 after jesse spent great time and money defending his innocence the league made its final ruling and now he has no choice but to look ahead to week 5

9269689 cant be a champion for feminism by opposing womens reproductive rights
9269690 no woman in her right mind who values her freedom would ever vote for mccain just because his vp is a beauty queen
9269691 because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america

9269696 geraldine ferraro was the first female vp candidate chosen by a major party in her case the democratic party in 1984 so palin isnt breaking any new ground here hillary clinton broke new ground nearly becoming the democratic nominee for president this year sarah palin represents a political gimmick by john mccain

9269714 with a second category and two first category hills and the finish at the top of the last difficulty we started this tour of germany immediately with the queen stage
9269715 it is a little bit strange but the organizers decided that as for me it was a rather good thing even if i still did not reach the shape i am looking for i attacked in the most difficult part of the last climb to try to catch the leading rider but gerdemann was alone in the lead i achieved the most important part of the job to try to reduce the gap but in the last part which was not so difficult gerdemann increased the gap there are still some difficult stages left to race like the one of tomorrow and the fifth one without of course forgetting the time trial that will take place the last day it is a 34 kilometers long race the perfect distance for me and if i feel good it will give me the possibility to finish amongst the first of the final classification

9269768 if barack obama is elected i just dont know what the country would do
9269769 many major institutions in our nation and you probably know at least part of what im talking about might not support her ascension to the presidency
9269770 palins passport obama chairman of the senate foreign relations subcommittee on europe went to europe for the first time in his life for a campaign event
9269771 do you not think it is appropriate for a presidential nominee to have a face to face interview with a prospective candidate for the office of vp of the united states of america before nominating them or does this strike you as perfectly appropriate
9269772 palin hasnt been on your radar screen because shes been hard at work making change
9269773 if palin doesnt gaffe it up this is checkmate mccain
9269774 this pro palin narrative is replicating all over the place
9269775 and its fun watching this spammer quake in his boots at reality intruding upon his fantasy so quickly
9269776 terrified im disappointed and somewhat amused lets not forget this post came from some unidentified whisperer and not steve himself
9269777 the only thing that will take mccain palin down is something we dont already know
9269778 with palin as vice presidential nominee are you more or less likely to vote for mccain
9269779 yes but thats the losing narrative pegging her as not ready when she has executive experience and is a reformer with results and is seeking an office where on the job training is a full time endeavor is a political loser it just makes people ask why obama didnt take the on the job training role quayle proved himself a moron and sailed into the vice presidency why because we vote for president
9269780 terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease
9269781 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us
9269782 it cant be in senator obamas interest for the punditocracy to spend its time arguing about whether the republicans vice presidential pick is
9269783 the money thats been appropriated for the project it should remain available for a link an access process as we continue to evaluate the scope and just how best to just get this done

9269786 i think were going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project
9269787 single handedly killed the leading symbol of republican spending excess in washington the bridge to nowhere
9269788 if i dont win its not going to be because of my race its going to be because i didnt project a vision of leadership that gave people confidence
9269789 but among the critical undecideds the palin pick made only 6 percent more likely to vote for mccain and it made 31 percent less likely to vote for him 49 percent said it would have no impact and 15 percent remained unsure more to the point among undecideds 59 percent said palin was unready to be president only 6 percent said she was if the first criterion for any job is whether youre ready for it this is a pretty major indictment of the first act of mccains presidential leadership
9269790 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington but when you get to know her youre going to be as impressed as i am
9269791 the obama people should say nothing they dont need to
9269792 this palin thing has completely changed the dynamic of this election
9269793 it cant be in senator obamas interest for the punditocracy to spend its time arguing about whether the republicans vice presidential pick is
9269794 i say hes ok look at me but vote for him
9269795 vote for me im experienced and ready to lead and look at this wonderful shining conservative rising star who represents the gop of the future shell be learning the ropes

9269797 sarah palin is not hillary rodham clinton she is not condoleezza rice she isnt kathleen sibelius or olympia snowe or janet napolitano shes not susan eisenhower or dianne feinstein
9269798 but when he says the dems are stupid to equate bush with mccain hes right read it
9269799 we cracked that cieling not in the name of any individual but in the name of our causes womens issues right to choose poverty education health care equal pay gun control does governor palin support those issues no then she is not one of the cracks she is part of the cieling
9269800 absolutely yup yup especially with a good team around us
9269801 shes going to learn national security at the foot of the master for the next four years
9269802 i used to respect the man but hes turning into some sort of senile old goat what im supposed to vote for him now because hes doddering around the stage with this evangelical chick from the nra whos half his age
9269803 we didnt support hillary because she uses the same restroom as us but because she was in tune with the issues we care about this lady doesnt sound like she understands women in the slightest probably because there hardly are any other women in alaska isnt the ratio like ten to one up there shes probably used to breaking balls not chatting with the gals about their concerns theres nothing more offensive to me than a conservative woman at least you can understand why men want to keep the good old boys in power

9269839 luckily when i was overseas because of my rank my pay was comparable
9269840 but a lot of other people their pay was not comparable and its a hardship on those families
9269841 this was a way that braintree and its town meeting could put something tangible together for these families who are being called up
9269842 it will come in handy for a lot of people i think its great it shows the town supports the troops
9269843 i think every town should do this for their soldiers
9269844 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes
9269845 theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
9269846 for while sen mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face
9269847 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
9269848 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell
9269849 but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
9269850 dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
9269851 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy
9269852 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
9269853 thats not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
9269854 i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming

9269949 i see the hand of karl rove in this pick it is cynical attempt to slice off the so called clinton democrats while shoring up the far right base
9269950 it will be miserable if we stay no water no power
9269951 obviously people can stay we are encouraging them to leave
9269952 we know this is a very difficult decision emotions are very high but we have to take a practical approach to this
9269953 president bush called to make sure the states were receiving all the assistance they needed from the federal government
9269954 i dont know what mccains motives are but i cant imagine any hillary supporters supporting a conservative like palin shes pro life and it seems shed oppose virtually everything hillary talked about during the campaign
9269955 a positive role model for women in politics remember this countrys made up of hundreds of thousands of small towns and that they represent america at its core
9269956 for all the reagan democrats who had supported hillary this decision clinches it for the mccain ticket
9269957 having palin locks these women in women are looking for a positive role model not the angry and bitter female politicians weve seen so much of lately
9269958 does he really think that just because were women and he has a woman vice president that well all vote for her people supported hillary not simply because she was a woman but because she was a qualified woman and sarah palin is no hillary clinton
9269959 being tokenized and if she does get in and turns out to be a disaster then as women were all screwed forever
9269960 if anything happens to john mccain this woman would be our president she was mayor of wasilla alaska i mean san joses bigger than that regardless of whether shes a woman or a man i find that prospect frightening either way
9269961 i suspect theres a part of that in there but the choice for vice president is a lot more important than just picking a characteristic thatll swing a few voters
9269962 john is picking her as a natural successor i dont think gender matters one way or another in how he made his choice
9269963 i think it was a stab to try and save the ticket by trying to get hillarys supporters to join mccain but it feels kind of like hes forcing them to make a commitment because shes a woman
9269964 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9269965 muuuummmmmeeeeee daddy take it pinky poooy i want it pinky pie
9269966 you want old macdonald go tell daddy good girl love you babe
9269967 i didnt think in spring training that id be part of anything like that
9269968 i wanted to but i didnt think it was a possibility sometimes you get things that you dont expect so it was nice
9269969 i know that everybody feels especially happy for him he looks really comfortable out there and i like that
9269970 little bit of nervousness in my first game in my hometown
9269971 thirty people here to see me and i just let it overwhelm me
9269972 i think were making it a whole lot more difficult than we should
9269973 no matter what you throw there hes going to get it
9269974 i get opportunities to walk him to face big papi i will do it
9269975 i felt the same as i did the last time against them
9269976 the last couple of days i got on base every time so its just one of those things
9269977 you try carrying a bowling ball in your belly for 40 weeks and then shooting it out your pee hole with the entire hospital staff staring at your nether region and thats not even mentioning having to pee every 20 minutes feeling like a fat cow persistent fatigue and constantly worrying about how your caring for unborn child plus you have to do your job just as competently and efficiently as you always did before you were pregnant including dealing with any previously born children only to be confronted with some a wipe having the nerve to tell you youre doing it wrong
9269978 but the river is inconsequential its just a problem of geography
9269979 in so many families the community is not divided by a border like the land
9269980 it makes it hard to peg exactly where you live what constitutes a permanent address
9269981 if they come and register with an address thats in the district we cant deny them
9269982 imagine if youre paying taxes on a half million dollar home because you want your child to go to garcia elementary and then we have to transfer you to another school because garcias too crowded
9269983 its not fair that there may be people that dont live in the district taking your childs spot
9269984 you can see a big difference between my friends here and over there
9269985 there was a nice big kiss at the end with both hands on the cheeks
9269986 reagan got 13 7 fewer votes from women than from men
9269987 mira que te mando que te esfuerces y seas valiente no temas ni desmayes
9269988 non ricordo ne la mia password ne la domanda segreta come faccio ad entrare in msn senza saperle
9269989 vorrei entrare e scoprire la password di un mio amico compiacente che programma uso
9269990 he is going to get further tests soon but that is a possibility
9269991 being thats a similar feel and in the same spot its a possibility yes
9269992 over the last couple of days theres been off and on pain and tonight it just wouldnt go away
9269993 in the second or third inning it came on my head was hurting so bad i could barely hold my eyes open i guess they didnt actually do the whole thing they didnt drill all the way down they just cleaned out the biggest part of it
9269994 im going to try and get some sleep tonight if itll let me and ill assess the situation tomorrow when i get to the ballpark
9269995 i think i may have been done it back to back a couple of times but thats exciting man
9269996 how does that happen the ball goes 5 10 inches over the wall two days in a row thats pretty impressive im just happy to be able to use that glove thats what owner arte moreno got me over here for
9269997 when torii first took off i thought maybe it was gone the way he was running and then it looked like it just stopped and fell into his glove
9269998 weve got to hit the ball where he cant get to it
9269999 dale scott cant miss those kind of plays he just cant miss them he explained it to me that hunter got his fingers on the plate before gerald tagged him the first time i cant repeat how i responded to that but thats what made me walk away he was nowhere near that damn plate
