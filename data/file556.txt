5560003 i drink energy drinks before sports events and when i have to stay up late for school
5560004 energy drinks do give you a lift very quickly but after they give you a burst of energy you go back to a state worse than before
5560005 ive had a couple of children athletes who think energy drinks will make them perform better
5560006 they have irregular heart rhythms because they do take these energy drinks
5560007 one night i felt as if my heart missed a beat about an hour after drinking an energy drink before studying for a test
5560008 i think energy drinks have a very negative effect on people anything that dramatically changes your energy level attitude and overall well being is bound to have its adv erse effects
5560009 i dont see how it can be improved on its a credit to the whole town
5560010 there was an ocean of energy out there and all i had to do was catch a wave
5560011 weve got a building that is finally equal to the faculty weve had for years
5560012 anything that brings folks downtown is good for market square merchants and business owners
5560013 we try to have things here that are family friendly but also unique and this certainly fits that category its something i think a lot of people will come and try out it will be a nice enhancement to the downtown experience
5560014 a tour of this nature can only be very positive
5560015 thats exactly what we need down here in old city more foot traffic and if we develop more traffic then merchants will be more likely to put a little extra money in their storefronts and it will encourage everybody to do a little more to make the whole area more attractive
5560016 tourism is very important to knoxville and the old city itself the more people you draw to the city the more business and when you have something thats going to draw people right to your neighborhood thats really good
5560017 i particularly like the idea because its putting things in a historical context
5560018 i think it would be good for locals as well as tourists i think its important for people to know something about the history of their city and for new people moving in it would be great for them too its fascinating i cant wait to see what they have come up with
5560019 im all for anything that brings people downtown to soak in the history or experience the new activities going on downtown
5560020 people have to be reminded that there are worthwhile things happening downtown theres more to downtown than just banks
5560021 anything they do that brings people downtown and business to all the restaurants contributes to a more vibrant downtown
5560022 i can see how this could be used in many positive ways in the future
5560023 once you have this network in place there are all kinds of possibilities
5560024 i think this is something cutting edge that has a lot of potential to be used in a lot of ways that we havent even thought of yet
5560025 we have an opportunity to use cutting edge technology to highlight the history and heritage of our area and present our stories to visitors who are coming to knoxville thats a very attractive product we are excited to be a part of the process
5560026 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5560027 i dont want to vote on a resolution honoring myself if commission wants to honor us we should be out of office
5560028 if current appointees want to recuse themselves that would be ok its just an honoring thing and weve traditionally done it on the last meeting before they would leave
5560029 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5560030 we do have an open investigation and we are working in concert with the knox county sheriffs office
5560031 once the superintendent feels we have complete and accurate information then a decision will be made as to what additional action might be appropriate
5560032 why were these students moving furniture at karns high school in a manner that appears to violate state and local laws and potentially school policy
5560033 secondly why did the school not contact 911 or other medical responders after he suffered closed head trauma and last why did it take 24 hours to report the incident to law enforcement
5560034 although our firms thoughts and prayers are with the law family we are aggressively pursuing answers to these very troublesome questions
5560035 our thoughts and prayers go out to the family of the student
5560036 a real tragic incident and a tragic day for one of our families
5560037 very sad my condolences and prayers go out to the family

5560040 the needed information to assure a fair and objective audit report
5560041 obviously we provided our response july 30 and richard has that response and when changes were proposed to it thats clearly something that we take very seriously and want to discuss with mr gilbert
5560042 we have great confidence in gen cooper to give the matter an unbiased and professional review and the mayor and his staff will cooperate fully with the state attorney general on the matter
5560043 he is the only attorney charged with that duty under the statute that is without conflict and is the appropriate attorney to make that review

5560047 frankly mr moncier was the last person i would have thought would have waited until the last minute to comply with the terms of probation
5560048 mr moncier knows better i believe mr moncier knew full well this court could not let this matter pass without notice
5560049 this is not a frivolous matter this is not a photo op
5560050 i will do what you told me to do and i will be a better person because of it
5560051 thanks to safer vehicles aggressive law enforcement and our efforts countless families were spared the devastating news that a loved one was not coming home
5560052 i dont think there is much left of the shoe to send back
5560053 they do have the bloody lynyrd skynyrd t shirt that evan had on and plan to send that back
5560054 evan of course will take a longer bit but has only stitches to overcome fortunately none on his beautiful face the attention the media has provided him has been very therapeutic for him mentally not to mention making him quite a little star with his friends
5560055 ill let you determine how to enforce the policy on your own
5560056 is there another option i can appeal to a higher court
5560057 mr oakley you have two options as the court sees it

5560059 i dont think i want you to appoint me one

5560087 he was born and raised in selkirk manitoba and he left when he was 15 years old to go play junior hockey in western canada that was his life until he stopped refereeing all his best friends were hockey players gordie howe was one of his closest friends
5560088 if theres one thing i can say about rob it is that he loved olivia and me with all his heart he was such a wonderful father and husband taking care of olivia during the day while i was at work no matter where we went rob was carrying her playing with her and most of all loving her i have no doubt in my mind that she and i were his last thought i will miss him more than words can say and am so thankful for the outreach of support i have gotten from all of the organizations rob has played with fans and former teammates it is such a blessing to know he was loved so much he lives on through olivia and me
5560089 we kept in contact with kevin and he had a very good offer in front of him from us but playing overseas is something kevin has wanted to do for the last two or three years and with the season he had with us last year his value was at the highest point it could be and he wanted to parlay that into a job in europe
5560090 well find someone we have a lot of faith in theyll be the backup and this elevates nick into the no 1 position and i doubt well be in a rotation system
5560091 but it does depend on what we find and there may be an alternating system again

5560098 it is with great sadness that i let you know that robert james guinn passed away saturday he was a wonderful husband father and friend and will truly be missed
5560099 my wifes going to be attending law school in chicago so it made sense for both of us to stay in the midwest
5560100 its pretty well known in minor pro hockey that they treat their players well in fort wayne it was a no brainer and wasnt a hard decision on my part to want to come back
5560101 we both enjoyed having each other as partners whether its kevin or another guy with the way the 76 game schedule is its not a bad thing to have two guys who can play look at last season i was out for a month with an injury so its good to have another guy you can look to
5560102 as many guys as we can sign from last seasons team the better
5560103 we had good chemistry in the dressing room and obviously a lot of talent with good character
5560104 we are retaining two important players for our defending turner cup team with the signing of shafranov and bertram
5560105 once both players got re acclimated to the ihl style of play they were major contributors to our overall success
5560106 dont let the penalty box door hit your rump on the way out
5560107 we need to fill the roster with guys who can play hockey and fill and position if they can add toughness and fill a position then we will sign them
5560108 yeah lets do it one more year and see what happens
5560109 if i go beyond this season will depend on how my body holds up but last year i didnt have any major injuries which was quite a change from the few years before that if i played i didnt want to go anywhere else but here this is home
5560110 we expect him to move up and play on the second line
5560111 due to his breakout season we know he can do it offensively and defensively hes an important part of the hockey club a key to us winning championships
5560112 and to have them back with their winning traits its good they know how to play how to win and its good to have that group back
5560113 already two years ago i had to pass to the curtain in series to unfortunately we have then not found an agreement hour is all to place is happy for coming in italy
5560114 there goes a handsome fellow but whats with the flip flops
5560115 but on a scale of 1 to 10 its probably only a 4 or 5 that it happens
5560116 on a scale of 1 to 10 its probably only a 4 or 5
5560117 komets general manager david franke said today he has sent offers to every player from last years team

5560121 drouin joins fort wayne head coach al sims and veteran center colin chaulk as komet returnees for 2008 09 sims and chaulk will each be serving the second year of their current agreements with the komets
5560122 the celebration in the dressing room was something but i cant let you in on most of the antics
5560123 but it was amazing you see that stuff on tv and to be a part of it in person it was unbelievable
5560124 colin chaulk is is under contract and thats all i can tell you about right now
5560125 the hague 23 mei mahkamah keadilan antarabangsa icj hari ini menetapkan bahawa singapura mempunyai hak kedaulatan terhadap pulau batu puteh manakala malaysia mempunyai hak kedaulatan terhadap terumbu karang tengah
5560126 hari ini berdiri seorang perdana menteri seorang doktor arkitek peguam pensyarah namun mereka ini tidak akan menjadi jika bukan kerana jasa guru
5560127 ahh i thought after 4 years learning law it is over now i need to follow another course and sit for examination
5560128 apa yang kita harapkan apabila ada cbc dan cbe ini kita dapat kekal standard serta menghasilkan peguam yang berkualiti tinggi agar kita mempunyai industri dan perkhidmatan perundangan serta juga hakim bermutu tinggi
5560129 dengan satu peperiksaan yang seragam untuk kesemua lulusan undang undang ia akan membolehkan satu piawaian yang seragam dilakukan untuk mereka yang mahu bergelar peguam
5560130 ini pastinya dapat meningkatkan tahap profesion peguam dan sekali gus kepada keseluruhan sistem perundangan itu sendiri
5560131 sekiranya kualiti peguam yang dikatakan memberi permasalahan hendak diatasi maka penyeragaman dalam sistem pengajian undang undang untuk pelajar dalam negara ini juga perlu dikaji
5560132 tidak adillah sekiranya pelajar dalam negara terpaksa melalui tempoh empat tahun pengajian sedangkan pelajar di luar negara tamat pengajian tiga tahun dan boleh menduduki peperiksaan itu untuk itu dicadangkan pelajar tempatan dibenarkan mengambil peperiksaan seawal tempoh pengajian tiga tahun
5560133 ini penting supaya kualiti peguam dalam sektor swasta dan kerajaan ada keseimbangan sebelum ini ramai yang memperolehi ijazah undang undang terus berkhidmat dengan kerajaan tanpa mengambil peperiksaan clp
5560134 jika pegawai undang undang kerajaan diarah mengambil cbe mereka mungkin memberi perkhidmatan yang berkualiti kepada rakyat malah rakyat tidak akan mempersoalkan mutu pendakwaan bagi kes kes jenayah berprofil tinggi sebagaimana dihadapi pihak berkuasa sebelum ini
5560135 soal tempoh pengajian di luar negara yang pendek berbanding pengajian undang undang dalam negara bukan isu yang penting keputusan yang cemerlang diperoleh oleh pelajar
5560136 kerajaan kena buat kajian perbezaan modul pengajian sama ada cukup atau kurang jika tidak cukup kena tambah dan cari program yang sesuai
5560137 apa yang kita pentingkan ialah prestasi peguam sama ada hasil produk universiti tempatan atau luar negara
5560138 apabila ada cbc dan cbe ini kita dapat kekal standard serta menghasilkan peguam yang berkualiti tinggi agar kita mempunyai industri dan perkhidmatan perundangan serta juga hakim bermutu tinggi

5560151 obviously there are many things that have to be taken into consideration were only three weeks away from our annual board of governors meeting and our schedule is already completed we would entertain changing it if it were the right situation the nice thing is youngstown is not a start up franchise its been doing business for a few years
5560152 they werent really on my radar as a representative of this league
5560153 i was trying to do things the way id want to be treated i dont want to go into another league one of our competitors and try to court a team away from it as far as we were concerned they were part of the central hockey league and i had no contact with the chl or youngstown
5560154 i wanted to come back and that was my plan the whole way i had such a great year and want a chance to repeat that i want to finish my career here i knew that a long time ago but now its definitely more certain you wont see me going anywhere else
5560155 lets go cohny youre the best we want a goal cohny

5560169 you don t get what you want you get what you are
5560170 you have the natural and inherent power to think what you want to think but it requires more effort to do so than to think the thoughts that are suggested by appearances
5560171 to think truth regardless of appearance is laborious and requires the expenditure of more power than any other work a person has to perform
5560172 warning youre thinking thoughts that are not the reality you wish to face keep thinking them and youll only increase the likelihood of these situations coming to you you need to find a way to change your thoughts fast
5560173 people who order their lives rightly in all areas are kept in poverty because of their lack of gratitude having received one gift from god they cut the ties that connect them to god by failing to make acknowledgement

5560184 australian special forces observed the airstrike which struck the taliban extremist group killing mullah akhtar mohammed
5560185 it occurred in broad daylight making concealment of the patrol difficult it was in an extremely remote area of the province and mullah akhtar mohammed was difficult to pinpoint as he travelled within a very small group
5560186 importantly the sotg located him positively identified him and when it was confirmed that there were no non combatant afghans nearby accurately targeted him for the successful isaf international security assistance force airstrike
5560187 thinking in the certain way will bring riches to you but you must not rely on thought alone paying no attention to personal action
5560188 you can do what you want to do your desire to do it is proof that you have within you the power to do it

5560206 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5560207 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5560208 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5560209 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5560210 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5560211 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5560212 the antenna is used for the contact less mode of the card
5560213 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5560214 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5560215 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5560216 the antenna is used for the contact less mode of the card
5560217 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5560218 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5560219 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5560220 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5560221 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5560222 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5560223 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5560224 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5560225 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5560226 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5560227 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5560228 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5560229 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5560230 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5560231 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5560232 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5560233 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5560234 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5560235 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5560236 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5560237 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5560238 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5560239 do you have to go in the middle of the night do you suffer from weak streams has hey ho lets go turned in hey whoa i gotta go
5560240 all the worlds a stage and wes all just actors on it
5560241 well tom back then when it was time to get married it was time to get married
5560242 look child a lovely fig and arent the clouds pretty today so fluffy and the sky so blue
5560243 that oh thats a man nailed to a block of wood writhing in agony while birds pick his flesh and dogs eat the larger hunks when they fall to the ground
5560244 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5560245 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5560246 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5560247 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5560248 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5560249 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5560250 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5560251 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5560252 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5560253 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5560254 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5560255 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5560256 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5560257 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5560258 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5560259 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5560260 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5560261 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5560262 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5560263 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5560264 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5560265 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5560266 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5560267 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5560268 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5560269 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5560270 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5560271 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5560272 i cant remember the last time i wrote a blog
5560273 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5560274 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

5560341 cake is a standard food item for a celebration people get excited about cake whether it is a birthday party a wedding an office party or another event bringing out the cake is the headliner to the occasion it could be stated that cake has become the new sacrament in our secular world there is procedure and protocol related to cake eating along with songs happy birthday and ritual cutting of cake at a wedding cake can also be a temptation there is an element of the forbidden in enjoying cake especially in this era of mad diets waistline watching and the pursuit of the physical ideal
5560342 on the occasions that i have served one of my cakes there has been much excitement and anticipation previous cake interventions have included a summer bbq a friends birthday brunch a dim sum an art fair and a new years eve party i even skated with cake along the canal at each of these events there has been a lot of eagerness to consume the cake it was in those instants that i managed to conjure the perfect temptation i have created a likeness to the real entity of cake and it is the audiences normal sensory input that is unable to distinguish the difference the art of the fake cake is in the creation of desire and craving in a person
5560343 we conversed on a series of themes which eventually lead to an installation and performance entitled
5560344 well actually im waiting for this really hot guy so if you dont mind

5560366 the rba at its september meeting should really take account of the impact of the slowing domestic demand and the particularly severe impact it has had on small business
5560367 we believe that now a rate cut is required in september and further rate cuts are required before the end of the year
5560368 the survey shows that the domestic economic slowdown is hitting small business harder and more systematically than any other sector
5560369 we believe that with competition that will in fact happen

5560387 hey i got this friend youll never believe who it is i think he might be coming around on your issues
5560388 i think its fair to say that bob has never been afraid to embrace controversial issues or positions and always had a knack for turning his actions into ink
5560389 the curse is that people view him as being this bombastic character who really is more thoughtful and has a greater degree of moderation
5560390 change the nature of the debate and raise the issue in the publics eye
5560391 it could enhance the things he enjoys doing speaking pontificating writing

5560479 are there areas we can improve in at san onofre clearly but thats true for every single nuclear power plant in the country today
5560480 after months of hard work in the studio we finally have the master version of our new album
5560481 we are all very stoked by the new album as we feel that this is the best release weve ever done and were impatient to share our songs with our fans
5560482 we have been rehearsing with carlos and it sounds pretty freakin cool hell be playing his first show with us in baton rouge lousiana on august 27 then new orleans on august 28 houston august 29 calgary canada august 31 so come on out to the show and rock with us crab corabi has one last show that hes committed to with us on september 5 in virginia beach

5560486 that was an incredible result and a fantastic feeling i hope it will be the first of many podiums in formula 1 the important thing was that we showed just how competitive we are at the moment and moved further ahead in fourth place in the constructors championship
5560487 there is a great atmosphere in the team and we are all working hard together to move forward which is why it was so satisfying to get on the podium in hungary
5560488 but valencia is a new race and we must start again i did plenty of street races when i was racing in champ cars and in that season almost all the tracks were new to me so i have learnt to adapt quickly it looks like an interesting circuit and its quite long so it should be a good show we will have plenty of work to do on friday to adjust the car to the track but we are in good form at the moment so i am optimistic for this weekend

5560509 my girlfriend called me and said thank goodness we found your purse
5560510 even if someone calls and says theyre a good samaritan and youre going to have those things right back my advice would be that you call and cancel those credit cards because you dont know who has them and you dont know if theyre trying to buy some time
5560511 i never got directly contacted by anyone at enfatico they did however complain to the company that was hosting the site regarding my fake funny whois data and that got the site taken down i was hoping for at least an email from them but i guess they werent sure who they were dealing with
5560512 this directnic free hosting account has been terminated due to a violation of the directnic free hosting terms of service
5560513 this was too easy to do i was really surprised that no one had thought of it already i guess sometimes the best ideas are the most simple ones i originally thought of this after first seeing the enfatico site and thinking that even i with basic html skills could spoof it if i had to quickly answer the why i did it question again i would say that i did it to show how quickly and easily it is to use the web as a means to make some noise rattle some folks and simply generate buzz frankly im looking for my next victim i mean next client who wants to use the web in a positive manner
5560514 i dont hate them or want them to fail i would gladly work there if given the chance unfortunately enfatico is the latest whipping boy and i figured that the timing was right considering the

5560522 thats why i pay more attention to the registration figures than to the polls i see at this time of year
5560523 the polls will change but we know we need 200 000 new voters to be competitive in georgia and now is when we have to get them

5560531 everyone wants to win a championship but when these guys look back on this season they are going to be proud of what they accomplished
5560532 im proud of what they did to go 10 2 down the stretch is pretty amazing
5560533 it says a lot about the character of the guys in the locker room the way they fought all year
5560534 these guys are going to remember this season for the rest of their lives
5560535 im a guy that takes it year by year this is such a long way from my home and family in memphis for me
5560536 were very pleased to have resolved this matter on favorable terms with the regulators in new hampshire and in massachusetts we reached an agreement on friday

5560539 i got a call from the coach of the londonderry wildcats who said if there was anything they could do they will
5560540 i thought for sure there were positives for everybody and im sure there were negatives for everybody
5560541 well look at the tape and evaluate that we got some experience against a good team against a fast team against a playoff team
5560542 i think were reaping the benefits of the eat local program promoting local agriculture weve never had a busier summer
5560543 they get a disease and its tough to get rid of it although it looks like our pumpkin crop is going to be all right he said
5560544 were right on par with where we were last year at this time despite the weather
5560545 its not as devastating as it would have been if wed had this rain in may or june the plants were able to get established before the worst hit but weve still had days where we havent had enough crops and had to put up a sign sold out at our farmstand on route 25 he said
5560546 it was a working farm that was part of the castle property said person whose family has owned the farm since 1948 hes been running the farm since 1978
5560547 so i was just trying to relieve a little of that pressure
5560548 it really didnt justify having a car solely assigned to them
5560549 hopefully theres a ripple effect and other departments do the same thing
5560550 the cost savings in 2005 was between 108 000 and 120 000 a year
5560551 and that was when gas was probably 1 50 less per gallon

5560559 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5560560 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5560561 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5560562 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5560563 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5560564 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5560565 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall
5560566 it is also perfect timing for the editorial boards to connect the dots between the failure of the florida office of financial regulation and the dominant political ideology of the past decade that abjured regulation in favor of the free market this may be easier to do now that real estate advertisement revenue from the growth machine has dried up
5560567 this friday floridas revenue estimating conference will convene to present their official budget forecast for the upcoming year and beyond prior to friday they believed floridas declining revenue might show a slight uptick prepare yourselves for more bad news as conditions have only worsened and their forecast is likely to reflect darker skies
5560568 mccains nasa stance went from downright schizophrenic to outright delusional yesterday with his campaign boasting of his influence on space policy in his former role as chairman of the u s senate committee on commerce science and transportation without mentioning that under mccains watch the impending five year gap between the retirement of the shuttle and the development of the next generation vehicle was created putting thousands of space coast jobs at risk
5560569 the fate of 3 key right wing backed amendments to the florida constitution will be decided by the florida supreme court in the very near future
5560570 i cant say ive ever really been a fan of the press there are some really great reporters and columnists which still operate in the traditional press but i lament the sheer lack of coverage of state and local politics that has existed even before this latest round of layoffs the traditional press has been largely complicit and indeed an enabler in a lot of the failed politics and policies of the last quarter century

5560583 the associated press document provides additional evidence suggesting the obama campaigns insistence that obama was never trained in islam and he never lived as a muslim is not accurate
5560584 moreover the document indicated that obama may have been an indonesian citizen when he lived there
5560585 this is an issue the obama rebuttal fails to address at all evidently conceding the accuracy of the claim
5560586 the obama rebuttal misses the point in claiming my statements about the school registration are a lie
5560587 it is clearly true that the an american expat in southeast asia blog did state the registration listed obama as an indonesian citizen and a muslim that is not a lie
5560588 now that we have the ap photo we see the blog was correct in describing the registration
5560589 the most convincing evidence obama was living in indonesia as a muslim not simply registered as muslim because his father was muslim comes from obamas experience at the government run public school at sdn 1 menteng jakarta not from his time at the catholic assisi school in jakarta
5560590 to put it quite simply mengaji classes are not something that a non practicing or so called moderate muslim family would ever send their child to
5560591 the obama campaign desperately wants to deny obama was raised as a muslim child in the four years he lived in indonesia from age 6 to 10
5560592 what the record clearly shows is not only that obama received islamic instruction at least in the public school he attended
5560593 but he received the type of islamic instruction reserved for muslim children in a government school system that mandated islamic instruction at that time for all children attending public school in indonesia
5560594 which existing supreme court justice would you not have nominated
5560595 from 1974 to 1977 thomas was an assistant attorney general of missouri under then state attorney general john danforth
5560596 in 1981 he joined the reagan administration from 1981 to 1982 he served as assistant secretary of education for the office of civil rights in the u s department of education from 1982 to 1990 he was chairman of the u s equal employment opportunity commission
5560597 in 1990 president george h w bush appointed thomas to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
5560598 i dont think he was an exp a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation
5560599 was it that barack obama didnt like justice thomass vote on the recent child rapist case kennedy v louisiana no that couldnt be it barack obama agreed with thomas on that decision justice ginsburg meanwhile a liberal favorite on the court whom john mccain listed as one of his least favorite justices during the same forum opposed giving child rapists the death penalty so whats so wrong about thomas and so right about say ginsberg senator obama explain the logic he cant of course and still win an election which is why he agreed with thomas
5560600 was it that barack obama didnt like justice thomass vote on the recent d c gun ban case nope that couldnt be it either barack obama wound up ultimately agreeing with thomas and the majority on that one too
5560601 justice ginsburg on the other hand had issues with the second amendment in that case but you would nominate justice ginsburg senator obama the truth is that obama was for the draconian d c gun ban before he was against it and he publicly became against it after his private remark about rural americans clinging to religion and guns out of bitterness over economic circumstances was made public
5560602 did obama disagree with justice thomas on the recent cross burning case virginia v black obamas favorite justice justice ginsburg wrote that cross burning bans are constitutionally suspect justice thomas disagreed and wrote a passionate dissent during oral arguments he said theres no other purpose to the cross no communication no particular message it was intended to cause fear and to terrorize a population does obama take issue with the impassioned thomas dissent
5560603 rick did an amazing job of asking the questions most of us would ask the candidates if we could
5560604 i just really liked how john mccain gave well stated answers he didnt even have to think he takes a stand barack has a charming personality he didnt always give the direct answer
5560605 i think obama did very well and he doesnt need to win a majority of this audience he merely needs to keep mccains support below typical trends but this was mccains best performance in memory for the first time i can think of in 08
5560606 but i also think that its worth noting that but i suspect he may be riding high for a while after tonight
5560607 obama wasnt just bad but that mccain was very good
5560608 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5560609 the afl cio and three other labor rights groups have asked the federal election commission fec to investigate whether wal mart stores inc unlawfully pressured employees to vote against democrats in november because their party would help workers to unionize
5560610 wal mart broke federal election rules by advocating against democratic candidate u s sen barack obama in meetings with employees
5560611 federal election rules allow businesses to push for specific political candidates to shareholders executives and salaried managers but they prohibit such actions for hourly workers

5560647 that all kids are doing it when thats not the case a large majority of kids arent doing it underage drinking is not okay
5560648 we came here to learn more about what it is we can do to stop underage drinking
5560649 its an excellent training where officers get a chance to have their questions answered
5560650 o que importante dizer que o presidente quando me convocou para o cargo e eu n o podia aceitar por raz es pessoais ele insistiu confio muito na sua capacidade de trabalhar o tema dos mortos e desaparecidos disse eu n o vou passar a hist ria como o presidente que colocou uma pedra sobre isso essa interpreta o que se fez agora de que o presidente mandou encerrar o assunto equivocada

5560659 it was a lot of freedom i could go out to eat every night with friends i could get a taxi if i wanted things that you have to be careful about here in the u s you could just do it
5560660 students are generally well behaved and polite but some could try harder
5560661 for the kids they get used to hearing and seeing the foreigner speak so they can work with them in their jobs
5560662 sometimes i feel like its unfair to the chinese teachers because we arrive at school and the kids are running up to us and screaming out names
5560663 they like to take their teachers out to dinner or out for drinks after class
5560664 id teach them something a little bit off like to test them and the next day i would review it and they would actually remember it
5560665 if you like to travel if you like education there are ample opportunities i encourage anyone to try it
5560666 i asked one of my 6 year old students what is your fathers name
5560667 whenever you travel abroad you bring back a better understanding of people and that things arent always the way they are in america
5560668 awareness that people live in a different way not worse or better
5560669 she will sing a track from her new album at the mtv video music awards in hollywood on september 7 in her first public performance since her disastrous appearance at the 2007 ceremony
5560670 yeah its going to be a little bit of pride that were going to wear thats for sure
5560671 we still havent realized the full impact because so much of the job is still in progress
5560672 but its two or three times what we did in the previous olympics
5560673 the other actually blocks out some of the sun to provide a cooler environment underneath for the athlete as well as the spectator
5560674 los preparativos para proteger la vida y la propiedad deber an haberse completado
5560675 el centro de fay cruzar la costa del sudeste de florida en la ma ana del martes
5560676 we were pleased to extend our podium streak to eight straight in the gst class
5560677 having walt on the team with us was beneficial in developing our setup for topeka and he will ride for us again at the new jersey round in two weeks this is the home stretch and every point is critical in our chase for the championship
5560678 a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5560679 we won a massive victory in a few weeks and we did so with very limited loss of american and allied lives we were able to end aggression with minimum overall loss of life and we were even able to greatly reduce the civilian casualties of afghani and iraqi citizens
5560680 well then why was there a banner that said mission accomplished on the aircraft carrier look i have said a long time that reconstruction of iraq would be a long long difficult process but the conflict the major conflict is over the regime change has been accomplished and its very appropriate
5560681 without reality television the city of los angeles would be a pretty barren zone
5560682 certainly an unscripted show like survivor is not the same as a talent show which is not the same as a gameshow i have great respect for the emmys and while any gain for nonfiction programming is great hopefully every year well move a bit more in the right direction
5560683 eventually i think we will see some distinction from field vs stage shows the same way we have seen dramas vs movies categories
5560684 is a huge reason why survivor has been such a success he strikes this balance between providing information and taking an editorial view he calls the contestants to task but has such real warmth about him that everybody loves jeff hes not only a great ambassador for our show but hes a great ambassador for our country
5560685 tom bergeron knows how to make us laugh but also knows when things need to be taken seriously hes spontaneous and sets the tone for the show there have been some difficult moments on the air with people dealing with family members dying and other members dying and other tragedies then moments of great humor and tom can handle it all
5560686 incredibly professional and hes very good on his feet he can build the dramatic moment or react quickly with humor hes endearing and knows how to connect with the contestants you can rely on him to bring the show in on time and he can handle anything that comes up
5560687 howie mandel is the glue that holds this show together you just cant imagine anyone else hosting this show
5560688 heidi klum made it all relatable to the audience and brought them into a part of the fashion world shes not mean but she speaks her mind and is open and honest which comes across well in the show
5560689 jeff is a pioneer no other show like survivor ever existed ryan has been at the forefront of the biggest show to hit primetime television howie took a gameshow and made it special heidi made viewers feel like insiders in the fashion world and tom made this ridiculous ballroom competition make sense everyone in this category has done something remarkable with their shows
5560690 edition was actually up 21 percent from the previous week and thursdays brother showed an increase over the previous week as well nearly every other show has been flat or down since the olympics began
5560691 the big brother faithful may only number in the six millions but they are very faithful and watch a show that hardly costs anything to produce three times a week
5560692 every season i think its the last right now i think this is the last season
5560693 sometimes the narrator has to throw their hate up on the wall and pass the mic its my favorite show i love it the hills season 10 is what im going for
5560694 greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends
5560695 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
5560696 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
5560697 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
5560698 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
5560699 the role of ngos and ngo networks in meeting the needs of us colonias
5560700 help small ngos maintain accountability by encouraging them to preserve their smallness
5560701 have a different method of analysis they start with different questions and refer to different principles
5560702 represents both the achievements of past working class struggles and the requirements of capitalist production
5560703 solutions to difficult social problems and as a process of social reconstruction through popular initiative
5560704 they are compelled to acculturate strategically in order to defend themselves
5560705 at present they seem capable of mobilization only as a group to defend their homes
5560706 only 11 of more than 70 replied that they could do anything to solve their own problems
5560707 colonias are actively produced and articulated rather than being a residual outcome of rapid urbanization
5560708 community organization structures are weak or nonexistent especially during settlement
5560709 ordinary families in urbanizing countries do prefer to live in large unfinished houses or even large shacks rather than in small finished ones
5560710 it stimulates the investment of nonmonetary resources those that are in most abundant supply in a developing country
5560711 historical perspectives on the practice and purpose of self help housing
5560712 dominant elite residential sector and a commercial spine as well as a series of concentric zones in which residential quality decreases with distance from the city center
5560713 is the worst section of the city in terms of housing quality and public services
5560714 has modest residential quality but shows signs of transition to a zone of maturity
5560715 the older the squatter settlement the better and more substantial it is
5560716 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5560717 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5560718 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5560719 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5560720 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5560721 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5560722 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5560723 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5560724 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5560725 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5560726 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5560727 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5560728 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5560729 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5560730 it didnt go the way we wanted but after that we said that we wanted to get better every game that we would take one game at a time and we did just that
5560731 getting that first loss after a full year going unbeaten it kind of wakes you up im glad it was in the first game and not the last
5560732 were getting better every single game and we have some great momentum
5560733 we expect a tough match but were looking for gold
5560734 there are very nice personalities and different personalities out there
5560735 pia has been excellent at letting our own personalities shine
5560736 fridays match against brazil in beijing will be a repeat of the olympic final from four years ago in athens when the u s beat the brazilians 2 1 in extra time to clinch the second of its two gold medals it had also won the title at the 1996 atlanta games when womens football debuted
5560737 we both scored a lot of goals so its going to be an exciting final
5560738 so its going to be great to get that rematch
5560739 weve played brazil before and we know theyre a pretty awesome team with a lot of great personalities
5560740 are you sure you dont need more food than this
5560741 i cant eat another cracker ever again no matter how long i live
5560742 these things are the most evil horrible food ever created
5560743 i want you to be able to say whatever you want to say
5560744 if you are the son of god tell this stone to become bread
5560745 it is written man does not live on bread alone
5560746 i will give you all their authority and splendor for it has been given to me and i can give it to anyone i want to so if you worship me it will all be yours
5560747 it is written worship the lord your god and serve him only
5560748 it says do not put the lord your god to the test
5560749 because you know that the testing of faith develops perseverence
5560750 no discipline seems pleasant at the time but painful later on however it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it
5560751 the church is not just a reservoir but a flowing river of blessing
5560752 hey man i gotta look out for my future ive gotta big contracting coming up after this season and i cant risk blowing out my arm
5560753 i compare this the talks to a shattered glass it would be very difficult to put the pieces together
5560754 we have already freed the towns we are on pursuit operations we will not stop until we catch up with them
5560755 they killed innocent defenseless civilians people are traumatized we need food medicines we want the soldiers here
5560756 will defend them at all costs against any move by any group that will disrupt our aspirations for a genuine and lasting peace
5560757 this is a consequence of the non movement of the peace process
5560758 if they keep on saying that line and they continue to fail controlling them milf sub commanders then the government will certainly control them
5560759 if he made a decision to go or fight against it we didnt advise him either way
5560760 we really did keep our fingers out of this one
5560761 president musharraf has been a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5560762 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
5560763 the united states will help with these efforts to see pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable prosperous democratic modern muslim nation
5560764 there is a great deal of frustration on the part of the u s government with pakistans inability to follow through on what the u s sees as its clear commitments
5560765 it remains very much to be seen whether this new democratically elected leadership will really be able to follow through in a sustained and coherent way
5560766 it could actually be setting the torch to the kindling inside the country
5560767 i dont want the people of pakistan to slide deeper and deeper into uncertainty
5560768 it puts a lot more responsibility squarely on the government there is no more excuse any more they have to stand up and do things they cant blame musharraf
5560769 i really dont think he has been a factor for six months
5560770 he hasnt been able to do that while he was in the presidency and he wont be as well positioned out of the presidency to interfere
5560771 strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5560772 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face
5560773 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5560774 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5560775 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5560776 we are pleased to deepen this relationship and are confident that this transaction will create long term value for mufg shareholders while creating new opportunities for unionbancal employees and customers
5560777 im confident union banks present and future customers will be delighted with the results
5560778 look dude its obvious that doctors arent getting any younger and im just getting older so im going to just pretend like youre an old grandpa and tell you all about my period mmm kay
5560779 so youre saying i should stop plucking my gray hairs so i look a little more trustworthy
5560780 captain america is one of the true iconic super heroes of our time and to design the new look for a new cap we had to go with the most iconic preeminent painter of our time alex ross
5560781 theyre shiftless anyway they nascar just need to do something
5560782 that was a really poor and foolish decision on the part of our key guys
5560783 a couple of guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us to me the frustrating part is why
5560784 i know theyre probably frustrated from the standpoint of wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and wanting it to look like were handicapped even more than we actually were i understand that but thats not an excuse
5560785 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5560786 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5560787 the expectations we set for everyone at joe gibbs racing begins with me and i personally apologize to nascar our partners and our fans for the negative light this situation has cast upon all of us
5560788 i found out about it halfway through the dyno session last night when i went over there to see what was going on
5560789 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5560790 but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5560791 we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor if you win that engine dyno good for you
5560792 thats how weve felt the last few years the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped and then win it again thats awesome thats a great story so that wasnt able to be told so now were sitting here going over this issue
5560793 that would seem to me like it would be actions that are extremely detrimental to stock car racing if theyre going to make decisions based on parity after theyve given them what theyve given them with regard to the parameters on their engine based on flawed data due to the spacer that certainly is detrimental to my interest
5560794 well get together our groups back in concord n c and daytona beach and discuss whats next i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5560795 we historically dont make our decisions on penalties within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno in the end we got what we needed to
5560796 they got their advantage when people get an advantage they dont want to give it up
5560797 sometimes they go to extremes to keep from giving up the advantage thats just what they did
5560798 like everything we do theres a lot of opportunity for things to happen and many times its just different circumstances that come up
5560799 nascars got a real problem figuring out what they want to do
5560800 first of all they gave toyota too much which they shouldnt have done it wasnt fair for them to give toyota folks the expectation they could keep that advantage and now that theyve done it it isnt fair to let them keep the advantage
5560801 for someone to try to go around that amp certainly nascars got a huge problem and well be watching to see what they do with it
5560802 when leasing a camry when he knows damn well that if he was offered a bentley coupe for the same price hed sign that contract quicker than a crackheads heartbeat

5560806 this is situational awareness where people who work in critical infrastructures throughout the state are reporting suspicious activities
5560807 tlos are not getting information on private citizens in their homes this is a speciality unit that links tlos together for the purpose of reporting suspicious activity
5560808 if we were to see one person taking a lot of pictures of the power plant at palo verde nuclear plant that could be a terrorist opportunity
5560809 a lot of it is straight up crime prevention but with a twist
5560810 were focused with speciality other units something may happen here in mesa and tlos can work their counterparts in other cities to check if theres anything going on there we can contact each other directly and share information we dont have to go through others as we might have had to do as far as im concerned its a good program
5560811 its not big brother at all but i can see that the aclu might have a problem with it
5560812 what we dont want is a policy that encourages non law enforcement personnel to keep tabs on their neighbors
5560813 this sounds like good police work and smart profiling based on behavior rather than racial or ethnic factors the policy clearly targets behavior we just need to keep tabs on dps to make sure their officers and volunteers in practice dont cross the line and begin replacing suspicious activity with skin color when targeting individuals

5560837 we strongly condemn this reproductive health bill as an outright violation of the fundamental rights of men women children and families enshrined in our philippine constitution and a blatant opposition to our moral principles as a christian nation
5560838 this shameful railroading of a seriously flawed bill by our elected and trusted lawmakers is indeed a manifestation of the sad state of governance in our country
5560839 other ambiguous terms like family planning reproductive health right health education and health care gender quality and equity among others just heighten our suspicions that the bill is primarily and truly anti life anti marriage and anti family
5560840 the state recognizes the sanctity of family life and shall protect and strengthen the family as a basic autonomous social institution it shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception the natural and primary right and duty of parents in the rearing of the youth for civic efficiency and the development of moral character shall receive the support of the government

5560850 the speaker of the house two of them actually theyre right here these babies are totally portable but they produce really good sound so we use them at home for the most part definitely our speakers of the house
5560851 this speaker totally has power all you need is four triple a batteries and you can power it right up did i mention that its a lovely shade of white and comes in shiny plastic packaging
5560852 well frankly ive seen these speakers and ive seen the guy youre talking about and i know which one is more exciting

5560860 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
5560861 if we would have preemptively worked with russia with georgia making sure that nato had the kind of ability and the presence and the engagement we could have perhaps avoided this

5561053 this is about a publishers commitment to its author to get one of a very few pro obama books out into the marketplace in the shortest amount of time
5561054 our initial order was based on the book being available to all booksellers simultaneously an even playing field
5561055 they are not going to bully us and the book will be a huge success in spite of their boycott
5561056 today was certainly more action than hes gotten and the plan is to get him in saturday
5561057 hes getting a lot better hes in shape so im hopeful we go this week each day without any setbacks

5561065 i was very proud of him he made a decision to go into the military and to give his life direction and purpose everything about him ill remember being his dad we did all the father son things together his grin his sense of humor ill remember different things about him everyday

5561067 he said you know dad youve always taught me to love this country and he said thats what im doing someone has to do it
5561068 as a parent i would give anything to have him back but he was grown man he made that decision
5561069 he always had that sideways smile on his face that grin like he was in on a joke that we werent always had a great sense of humor
5561070 i worry and i think and dwell on all the memories i wont have with him alex believed that the sacrifice was worth it he believed the risk was worth it he believed in our way of life and he believed it was his job to defend it
5561071 it is not lost on me that the spitz picture is one of the most popular and iconic photos in all of sports

5561093 i cant believe we are back to a 1990 like emergency and nobody in new delhi or srinagar has shown any apparent concern
5561094 separatists seem to have the run of the field and it is moving nobody nothing
5561095 the people on the street are no longer content with hartals or being directed from this place to that they want to breach the loc at the very least we are riding a tiger and it has become perilous to dismount it they have turned up in huge numbers on our call now they expect us to do something concrete god forbid if the leadership slips away from us into unknown hands this is a very fluid situation
5561096 dont forget kashmir is not rid of militancy or militants
5561097 they are around watching it takes very little for them to create a flashpoint and give a more radical turn to this a leaderless movement is a dangerous one
5561098 we have been frustrated in the past but not now
5561099 this movement was dead we have resurrected it and now we are going to take it all the way hurriyat or no hurriyat
5561100 but these boys are running away with the agenda they cant be controlled
5561101 we have lived under indian excesses too long the people of kashmir have now risen and expressed their will it is high time we are allowed to decide our own future
5561102 the un should send its peacekeeping forces to kashmir immediately and hold a plebiscite the kashmiris will declare their will to join pakistan
5561103 independence this side of the loc and independence that side
5561104 he didnt do much but its nice to have him back
5561105 its just going to be about knocking the rust off and get going i dont think it will take that long at all like riding a bike
5561106 you know how it is when you have to play you have to play
5561107 i told the trainers you are going to have to get me anti anxiety medication
5561108 i spent all offseason rehabbing both shoulders and the thumb and then my back gets hurt good night
5561109 just starting these two preseason games was huge for me i thought i did well
5561110 weve taken the art of thinking patterns and we have kind of woven it into a story in which lumina osity can experience certain things to amplify her glow and make it bigger
5561111 we are teaching mind body awareness connection along with entertainment
5561112 i think personally that the message is to never think about what you cant do but always think about what you can do to help the world friends and people
5561113 its our hope that they have all these tools that are very easy to use in their pockets and accessible in any moment
5561114 feel free to toy with your hair while waiting for this site to load
5561115 it is envisaged that customers will ultimately benefit from cost effective and innovative internet telephony service the grey market tendencies shall be curtailed
5561116 these are the guys who made 300 a huge hit
5561117 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5561118 but it would be the biggest mistake of his life if he goes on the mound hoping to show the rangers something thats high school stuff
5561119 realcentralva com is a must read for anyone who wants to make sense of the chilling local market
5561120 mom will i get sued if i what if i does this clause sound right
5561121 these are fair comparisons but they ignore another important tradition from which the obama candidacy emerges that of fannie lou hamer ella baker barbara jordan shirley chisholm and the many thousands of black women activists whose names history failed to record when barack obama takes the stage in denver he could draw on the political rhetoric of african american women as the core of his historic speech the obama candidacy is built on the organizational foundation laid by these women at least as much as it is on the oratorical showmanship of black male preachers obama can lay claim to hamers legacy to remind americans of the precious value of the vote
5561122 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5561123 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5561124 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5561125 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5561126 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5561127 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5561128 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5561129 who are open to doing something on the production side
5561130 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5561131 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5561132 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5561133 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5561134 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5561135 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5561136 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5561137 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5561138 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5561139 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5561140 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5561141 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5561142 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5561143 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5561144 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5561145 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5561146 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5561147 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5561148 we ought not to interfere with his decision that the plan is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances
5561149 implementation of the plan in his view would work to the overall greater benefit of noteholders as a whole i can find no error in principle it was his call to make
5561150 i felt comfortable i just wanted to win the heat with as little effort as possible and just not take any chances
5561151 i like to see where im at why she looks at the screen and not slow down too much
5561152 i was pretty mad but i had to get over it
5561153 it was pretty good always work the beginning and if i had to go id go but not too much
5561154 i feel pretty good i think everybody is a little sluggish it was just one of those days
5561155 im glad i finally got that first race out of the way
5561156 it wasnt as bad as i dreamed it would be i got out there and it was just like any other meet just dont look at the third level of the stadium seating
5561157 some people from the center came to our home to take us here
5561158 i accompany him when he does his exercises he doesnt have many psychological problems
5561159 after a week there was still a little pain but not much
5561160 theyll use the bars inside the rooms then theyll walk without the bars
5561161 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5561162 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5561163 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5561164 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5561165 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5561166 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5561167 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5561168 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5561169 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5561170 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5561171 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5561172 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5561173 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5561174 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5561175 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5561176 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5561177 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5561178 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5561179 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5561180 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5561181 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5561182 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5561183 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5561184 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5561185 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5561186 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5561187 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5561188 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5561189 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5561190 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5561191 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5561192 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5561193 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5561194 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5561195 it didnt go the way we wanted but after that we said that we wanted to get better every game that we would take one game at a time and we did just that
5561196 getting that first loss after a full year going unbeaten it kind of wakes you up im glad it was in the first game and not the last
5561197 were getting better every single game and we have some great momentum
5561198 we expect a tough match but were looking for gold
5561199 there are very nice personalities and different personalities out there
5561200 pia has been excellent at letting our own personalities shine with abby going down i think everyone has stepped up their game and were getting scoring from so many different places its so fun to be out there
5561201 we both scored a lot of goals so its going to be an exciting final
5561202 brazil is a great side but so are we we are going to have to come out and play our best just like they are
5561203 so its going to be great to get that rematch
5561204 theres going to be a lot of service old i can tell you that
5561205 it was a difficult decision but i want to recover in time for the us open
5561206 i am playing with great confidence it could not have come at a better time
5561207 how do we prepare our souls for the high holy days
5561208 within a few days of the initial demonstration morse was keeping members of congress in washington abreast of developments at the democratic national convention in baltimore as they happened the first practical application of morses invention to report a political party convention was no accident the formation of mass political parties their organization on local state and national levels the application of government patronage to knit them together their espousal of rival political programs and the ability to command the attention of the public all combined to give this period in american history its distinctive politicized quality the rise of mass parties has often been traced to extending the franchise to include virtually all white males however no parties with mass following could have come into existence without a revolution in communication newspapers quickly enlisted the telegraph in their quest to gather and distribute information
5561209 their new found cockiness has got some substance to it
5561210 it didnt go the way we wanted but after that we said that we wanted to get better every game that we would take one game at a time and we did just that
5561211 getting that first loss after a full year going unbeaten it kind of wakes you up im glad it was in the first game and not the last
5561212 were getting better every single game and we have some great momentum
5561213 we expect a tough match but were looking for gold
5561214 there are very nice personalities and different personalities out there
5561215 pia has been excellent at letting our own personalities shine with abby going down i think everyone has stepped up their game and were getting scoring from so many different places its so fun to be out there
5561216 we both scored a lot of goals so its going to be an exciting final
5561217 brazil is a great side but so are we we are going to have to come out and play our best just like they are
5561218 so its going to be great to get that rematch
5561219 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5561220 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5561221 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5561222 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5561223 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5561224 its a relief and now its just all about the unit and knowing what everybodys going to do and just kind of tailoring things to the way that we like it
5561225 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5561226 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5561227 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5561228 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5561229 speaking what people want to hear and tickling the ears of unrepentant truth rejecters
5561230 but jehoshaphat said is there not yet a prophet of the lord here that we may inquire of him
5561231 then the messenger who went to summon micaiah spoke to him saying behold now the words of the prophets are uniformly favorable to the king please let your be like the word of one of them and speak favorably but micaiah said as the lord lives what the lord says to me that i shall speak
5561232 when he came to the king the king said to him micaiah shall we go to ramoth gilead to battle or shall we refrain and he answered him go up and succeed and the lord will give it into the hand of the king
5561233 so he said i saw all israel scattered on the mountains like sheep which have no shepherd
5561234 these have no master let each of them return to his house in peace
5561235 then the king of israel said to jehoshaphat did i not tell you that he would not prophesy
5561236 who will entice ahab to go up and fall at ramoth gilead
5561237 i will go out and be a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all his prophets
5561238 you are to entice him and also prevail go and do so
5561239 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5561240 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5561241 and id like to start with a victory to avoid breaking the
5561242 when i started my national team adventure four years ago there was a team and a group to build from nothing
5561243 we achieved this and today we are starting again from there this is a team of moral and technical quality that can still give a lot
5561244 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5561245 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5561246 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5561247 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5561248 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5561249 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5561250 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5561251 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5561252 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5561253 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5561254 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5561255 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5561256 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5561257 hes an icon here in china he has a very bright future
5561258 if anybody takes a hit from it its certainly nike simply because theyre all about performance whereas the others are about brand image
5561259 nikes all about you dont win silver you lose gold with that attitude its much tougher for them because he was certainly the cornerstone for their program
5561260 whenever he goes out he sees his own picture in the streets
5561261 we will continue to count on liu xiang as an ambassador for our company and our brand because his achievements both on and off the field will continue to inspire fans and consumers throughout china
5561262 its about picking yourself up when youre down and coming back stronger
5561263 the united states was playing china in baseball which was sort of weird because the chinese do not really play baseball the chinese are here because well they were already here the host country automatically qualifies in every sport

5561279 doctor question thats always bothered me and a lot of people mayflower combined with philadelphia a no brainer right cause this is where the mayflower landed not so it turns out columbus actually set foot somewhere down in the west indies little known fact

5561283 oh no were not asking you to lose weight that would be illegal we just want you to be healthy by eating less so go home weigh yourself on a scale write than down then subtract 20 from that number and weigh that
5561284 well i think a stork he umm he drops it down and then and then a hole goes in your body and theres blood everywhere coming out of your head and then you push your belly button and then your button falls off and then you hold your butt and you have to dig and you find the little baby

5561286 i like to prove it not just say it i like to prove who is the best and who is the strongest
5561287 at this point we have no relationship and i dont see that changing its just gotten to a point where i think lines were crossed if you ask me coaches should be coaches management should be management and i dont think those lines should be crossed but when you cross those lines you put yourself in position for things like this to happen
5561288 book club definitely rewinds at least three years off the clock
5561289 duh its a book about someones personal emotional spiritual journey what else would you expect it to be about
5561290 clearing out all of your misery gets you out of the way you cease being an obstacle not only to yourself but to anyone else only then are you free to serve and enjoy other people

5561401 evidence reveals that the respondent without following the requisite protocol set forth in the regulations of the new york state department of mental hygiene
5561402 deed to execute while rubin was confined to a psychiatric ward in a delusional state of mind
5561403 rubins vulnerability was patent the respondent filed and recorded the deed despite being told that he could not obtain signatures on legal documents from patients in psychiatric wards without following accepted procedures
5561404 the gravamen of the within charge is that respondent acted in a manner which evinces dishonesty fraud deceit and misrepresentation and that his conduct adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law
5561405 mr clinton believed in good faith that rubin j had the legal capacity to execute the deed
5561406 it is clear that neither justice barasch nor this court made any finding which would establish any fraud deceit dishonesty misrepresentation or any hint of venality or even wrong doing on the part of respondent
5561407 the respondents defense is based on his own nonexpert diagnosis that rubin was of sound mind and was competent to cede ownership of his property without consideration and without the advice of an independent attorney the respondents counsel posits a subjective standard based on what was purportedly in the respondents mind at the time he had rubin j execute the deed notwithstanding the objective facts that standard was adopted by the special referee and factored prominently in his assessment of the witnesses credibility
5561408 the respondents position disregards the protection afforded by the new york state department of mental hygiene the advice of family members the rules of professional conduct and rulings by both the supreme court and the appellate division

5561455 i wonder if you could clarify a little bit your testimony regarding incest im assuming that youre not in any way advocating incest as it could possibly lead to some sort of brilliance
5561456 the point primarily of my testimony is to say that even in incest the overwhelming majority of these infants in the nineties perhaps high nineties are perfectly normal children some of them turn out to be geniuses
5561457 s ometimes i think with the attitude that if just everybody had enough latex from the cradle to the grave womb to the tomb and everybody in america had all access to free latex and free abortion it would be a step in the right direction wed be a perfect world i mean that would be a step in the right direction from the attitude that im kind of hearing

5561500 it seems that the ward heelers of another age going door to door and driving old ladies to the polls have been re incarnated as geeks who adapt server resources send out targeted e mail and text messaging blasts and chop up phone bank lists for thousands of supporters to handle at their home computers
5561501 this piece grew out of a strange afternoon that i spent with my brothers in january on the occasion of my oldest brothers 60th birthday
5561502 we were all together in oregon and took the opportunity to go through a bunch of boxes of our late parents stuff the most unsettling find was a slice of wedding cake wrapped up in tissue paper and well preserved from october 1944 but there was also a big cache of their early correspondence much of it achingly personal writing this essay was my way of getting myself to sit down and read it it was also of course my way of dealing with my rage against the cell phone
5561503 at times of upheaval caused by technological change critics have a responsibility to make us pay attention to whats happening even or especially when changes are happening so quickly that we barely notice them and mentioning them seems like stating the obvious
5561504 but while shirkys right to marvel at the ways blogs wikis and social networks liberate us i dont think he worries enough about the ways these technologies alienate us in looking at technological reproducibility walter benjamin had it right he marveled and worried
5561505 hindi ko nga alam kung nakakainggitan ako or what kasi hindi naman kami lumalabas ng bahay
5561506 i know i have behaved wrongly but that was my yesterday
5561507 today i have changed for the better and i am here to prove it i am determined to be myself and win everyones heart
5561508 our quarterly economic forecast highlights a significant worsening in uk economic prospects there is now a distinct possibility of technical recession the level of uk unemployment is likely to increase to nearly 300 000 over the next few years reaching almost two million an increase above two million cannot be ruled out
5561509 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation
5561510 the uk economy urgently needs an interest rate cut to counter threats of recession
5561511 whilst a marked slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut when inflation peaks the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threats of a serious and prolonged recession the longer the mpc waits before cutting rates the bigger the danger that the economic situation would deteriorate

5561514 that the power of the narcos has surpassed the power of my government
5561515 the m rida plan is just a reproduction of the failed antidrug strategies weve been using for the past 20 years
5561516 the effort and lives the mexican people are giving to this fight
5561517 much larger than their share of responsibility for the problem
5561518 these days narcos think nothing of killing us for no reason other than marking their territory
5561519 unfortunately they admire people like the narcos who go in search of extremes
5561520 they still figure its best to live large for a few years
5561521 complain about the narco problem during the day and then go to bed with it at night

5561523 see it as a long term investment part of real estate for them is owning a piece of new york
5561524 the flatiron is expensive but with the cheap dollar it made sense to increase our share
5561525 the stability of the new york real estate market is unique this current crisis will pass and the dollar will re establish itself we are confident
5561526 this isnt just about the dollar the strongest driver is that investors are looking for geographical diversification the same situation played out on wall street about 10 to 15 years ago
5561527 european companies are very much conscious of the potential windfall you buy cheap now with the belief that in 10 years the currency will have rebounded
5561528 in terms of infrastructure the u s is an emerging market
5561529 the situation is moving in a positive manner the tension is now being cooled down
5561530 the situation has improved quite a lot in regards to the standoff between the militaries from both sides
5561531 the tension around the area has been eased we hope very much that the situation will go back to normal as soon as possible

5561534 the plane made a crash landing into the traffic intersection but we have no reports of injuries but apparently fuel is leaking from the plane
5561535 theyre for prevention i dont want to go through the suffering of falling ill
5561536 theyre less aware that adults too require some types of vaccinations
5561537 for children compulsory immunisations have been put in place by the government but many adults dont see a need to get their vaccinations done because there is no legal requirement to do so
5561538 most will get certain vaccinations done only if it is required by their employers or when they are travelling overseas
5561539 in fact most adults dont bother about their vaccinations until something is reported in the news or happens to their friends or family members
5561540 i regretted not finding out about the chickenpox vaccine earlier
5561541 if i had known about the vaccination i wouldnt have thought twice about spending a few hundred dollars to spare myself from the torture and hassle
5561542 unlike other diseases like measles and rubella adult chickenpox is still very common adult cases also tend to be more severe compared to childhood chickenpox
5561543 the elderly with chronic heart and lung diseases need the most protection because an infection like pneumonia can worsen their condition even a bout of flu can cause severe complications
5561544 certain vaccines are not as well taken up as they should be
5561545 its always good if we can prevent certain illnesses from occurring instead of looking at the costs why not take it as an insurance against the disease
5561546 while it has been a very difficult week i believe the end result is a very positive step forward for the galaxy
5561547 bruce is the best coach for the galaxy and certainly one of the best coaches in the history of the league
5561548 my ultimate goal is to win championships and a build a club that all of our fans will be proud of
5561549 el periodo entre noviembre y diciembre de este a o
5561550 arsenal can today confirm that togolese forward emmanuel adebayor has signed a new long term contract with the club
5561551 everyone at arsenal looks forward to emmanuels continued contribution to the club over the coming years
5561552 we have to get behind him and support him because he is a tremendous force and he is of tremendous importance for the team you want your own fans to be behind him
5561553 what happened in the transfer period did not always reflect his deep desire and there was manipulation from agents on both sides but overall i am positive he will recover
5561554 every player needs to feel wanted i think he is settled in his own mind
5561555 he has given a lot in the first two games
5561556 selain itu juga kematian kematian akibat penangkapan tak sengaja oleh nelayan
5561557 i compare this the talks to a shattered glass it would be very difficult to put the pieces together
5561558 we have already freed the towns we are on pursuit operations we will not stop until we catch up with them
5561559 they killed innocent defenceless civilians people are traumatised we need food medicines we want the soldiers here
5561560 will defend them at all costs against any move by any group that will disrupt our aspirations for a genuine and lasting peace
5561561 this is a consequence of the non movement of the peace process
5561562 the redevelopment of this and some other unrelated blighted properties known as sisleyville is our highest priority
5561563 this particular tree it could kill a project were trying to make happen
5561564 the cedar is an exceptional tree i dont feel private property owners have a right to cut down trees that are a community asset
5561565 i dont know this roosevelt particular site but depending on where it is it seems development could be conditioned on protecting the tree
5561566 we are really wanting to get an ordinance from the planning department particularly on the grove issue
5561567 its tricky when youre dealing with private property but its tricky with any property really
5561568 ive been working on this for two years and we have yet to see a tree ordinance
5561569 we need the mayor to step up he needs to open up the discussion and get an interim emergency ordinance to happen
5561570 i dont think it matters who wants the development to happen or how good the development is
5561571 when youre analyzing the environmental impact of removing a tree you cant think about how much better things will be such as after a sewage treatment plant is built lets figure out how to construct a development around the tree
5561572 if were going to be serious about tree canopy in this city were going to have to come up with compromises save a tree though it diminishes the capacity of a site otherwise seattle becomes a concrete wasteland and is no longer the emerald city
5561573 we receive benefits from trees and we should be protecting them
5561574 some saw us as a threat like we were another kind of school
5561575 at that time there was a hunger for these kinds of things we were underground but also above ground because we were in the media
5561576 everyday there was something happening poetry readings theatre performances music i remember we had breakfast the morning after at a hawker centre in marine parade thinking we did a great thing
5561577 we came at the worst time actually there were no shows at all just meetings to talk about whats going on
5561578 we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments
5561579 the failure to reach consensus in the doha round in geneva is not synonymous with paralysis
5561580 what is the value of eight golds in beijing before a prime time audience in the us
5561581 id say us 100 million over the course of his lifetime
5561582 a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5561583 clearly quite tight and effectively getting tighter as a result of ongoing pressure on lenders cost of funds in the market
5561584 given there had been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect tighter financial conditions were not warranted
5561585 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5561586 all they are really saying here is that if they dont move towards less restrictive conditions the risk of a deeper or more persistent slowing of the economy would increase
5561587 they dont want that which is an argument to cut rates but by the same token the language is not strong enough to suggest they are heading towards a 50 basis point cut next month
5561588 i think it is consistent with 25 basis points next month
5561589 a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5561590 it says more about them than anything how they think how they envision their governing and so this is probably the most important thing they do until they show themselves in debates
5561591 theyll walk you in and theyll say ok weve got a question about your tax return or we have a question about this stock that you owned that you sold or we have a question about this speech that you gave or this vote that you took or this veto that you made
5561592 the spouses are an issue that was probably the one thing that surprised me the most is how much what your spouse has done said written makes a difference
5561593 you need to have a maximum impact around your convention when all eyes are on your party
5561594 kemp complemented dole in that he helped promote his pro growth economic ideas of cutting taxes and he also helped energize the party
5561595 anything that gets in the way that has the potential to diminish that youd rather not have
5561596 this cycle probably the best time to do it is on the friday afternoon when the democrats leave denver
5561597 why not start to squash their bounce and ride it through the weekend into minneapolis
5561598 theres a little bit of stagecraft that goes on at the end of the process to not only make sure it has an element of surprise but to really have a wow factor
5561599 also the women who are having children are having fewer children
5561600 a lot of it is delayed marriage and women getting started a little bit later in life
5561601 there are significant numbers of women in the u s who would choose a career over having a child married or unmarried
5561602 the black population is staying about the same and the white and asian populations are declining theyre not replacing themselves so the population is growing more diverse
5561603 what that shows is that women are finishing their degrees and having a baby right away
5561604 overall women with higher education levels have lower levels of lifetime fertility
5561605 more effective in lowering plasma glucose than were the drugs alone
5561606 we have to understand we can only keep him alive if the love we felt for him and the love he felt for us is somehow manifest in our lives
5561607 make a list of what you were grateful for in bill gwatneys life
5561608 he was a better golfer than i was i am not grateful for that
5561609 but he seemed to genuinely like it if i hit a good shot which is a sign of grace
5561610 he could have taken a lot of other roads but he chose public service
5561611 i am more grateful than i can say for the support he gave to hillary in this long last year
5561612 if you had introduced me as president bush id be convinced that bill gwatney wrote the script for your service
5561613 weve had a long history of economic success in the area thanks to our diverse economic mix
5561614 and these three projects being announced today reinforce that economic diversity
5561615 although houston texas made sense logistically the tax break training dollars and known quality workforce in michigan were the deciding factors
5561616 our workforce and supply chain in southwest michigan is very strong
5561617 the mega tax credit is extremely important its worth over 11 million in tax benefit
5561618 they are paying good wages and some of that money will rub off in west michigan
5561619 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5561620 they make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5561621 do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5561622 they might be good people in the flesh but the medias images of them are smelly and vile and i must always attack the medias representation of what is good or cool
5561623 will give this character an authentic and specific personal perspective combined with a unique sensibility
5561624 the mit one focusses on a cobalt phosphate material that they can make and deposit and then they use that to oxidise water in our case we use a manganese cubic structure which was developed initially by collaborator professor chuck dismukes of princeton as a mimick of the managanese cluster thats found in all photosynthetic organisms
5561625 that is the only centre in nature that actually oxidises water thats the big difference a manganese cluster is central to a plants ability to use water carbon dioxide and sunlight to make carbohydrates and oxygen weve taken what chuck dismukes has done a step further harnessing the ability of these molecules to convert water into its component elements oxygen and hydrogen
5561626 the coming talent shortage may force employers to overcome their age bias and introduce new opportunities with which to utilize this powerful asset

5561632 if a teacher comes from indiana he will know everything he has to know in chicago
5561633 offshore drilling would take years to provide any benefit while just one hurricane or exxon valdez incident could destroy north carolinas coastline forever
5561634 on my watch well never solve the gas problem by drilling off the coast of north carolina
5561635 the people who know best are telling me that with the 68 million acres the federal government already has leased id rather take those 68 million acres that are already leased and lets just go drill there starting tomorrow
5561636 i own the bnt last name last week i registered the account tizzers bnt before anybody had even logged onto sl with it harry had age banned it demanding an id check even though i who own the bnt last name am already id verified apparently anybody named tizzers is automatically a minor
5561637 i registered the name in remembrance of my dear departed friend and hero of free expression tizzers foxchase much as someone names a child after a dead relative
5561638 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
5561639 preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
5561640 theres a fear in the oil market right now about some of the pretty dramatic news weve seen coming out of the united states spreading into europe and japan
5561641 oil if you think about it has got plenty of room to fall
5561642 it takes a while before people pick up on it
5561643 theyve got to stay focused on the customers as hard as it is with all the distractions
5561644 mediocre and undistinguished for a mature and crucial e business industry
5561645 the baht is falling in line with other regional currencies against a strong dollar
5561646 the peso used to track oil but it has decoupled from that over a week ago and is now moving opposite the general direction of the dollar
5561647 twitter said that it simply cant afford to support long distance sms twittering anymore and the company claims
5561648 in 2006 there were just 819 women aged 20 24 living there out of a total population of 21 421 according to the most recent census
5561649 there is a very strong public interest in ensuring that australia invests in research and technology when it comes to cleaner coal options
5561650 the government recognises the reality of australias current energy mix if were going to tackle climate change we have to deal with the facts
5561651 we have to find a solution when it comes to coal fired power generation
5561652 we need to do that for australia we need to do that for the globe
5561653 that doesnt mean that you dont also invest in renewables

5561667 are you going to walk a half mile down the street to cross in the appropriate way when you see a clear way right there
5561668 i dont really like it because it will take 20 minutes to do it

5561673 we havent seen anything like this before where a company scores 10 points over its nearest rival
5561674 there was a question mark last year about apple that maybe it had taken its eye off the ball by concentrating on the iphone but now the iphone and ipod and mac are nicely aligned
5561675 most of apples windows based competition is suffering a bit from vista
5561676 complaints about vista are generating complaints about the computer makers
5561677 people know there have been some service and product quality problems but apple has an almost teflon like quality its problems dont really seem to matter to consumers
5561678 most lose it slowly like dell has which took a while and we see companies improve but apples extreme volatility is almost like its stock price
5561679 apple will be very difficult to catch but i dont think that these results where theres a 10 point difference will hold
5561680 my guess is that they will regroup at some point and come back
5561681 the company seems to have an uncanny ability to understand its users and read the market right they come out with so many new products that its just phenomenal
5561682 they provide customers with more and for most of the stuff you dont pay
5561683 its sort of a wining proposition no matter how they do it the more content google provides the higher the likelihood that their customers will be more satisfied
5561684 all of the talk that yahoo and microsoft cannot do search on their own is not helping either of them in terms of a consumers perspective
5561685 we advocated that rather than more information on the sidewall better the information be required at the point of sale
5561686 right now that tire efficiency data is not widely available
5561687 cost effective for consumers and the nation to reduce oil use
5561688 were the only industry of this size and scope that doesnt have a real voice in this process at best were humored at worst were ignored
5561689 is it making our community stronger or are we trapped in that model
5561690 the philanthropic dollars provide us the money to experiment and try new things
5561691 philanthropy can fail in a way that government cant but we can catalyze government investment in growing what works
5561692 there are a lot of people in this sector who will get nervous about the federal government becoming too engaged in philanthropy
5561693 but theres also this other argument that we dont want an agency that is going to over regulate us
5561694 we are going through one of the most uncertain and difficult periods in the world of finance that weve seen in recent history
5561695 any firm especially one as widespread as carlyle is going to have some stumbles but what is more germane is to judge a firm by its long term record of returns to investors and it seems to me that they have done a darn good job in that category
5561696 with innovation comes the occasional setback however over 20 years product and geographic expansion has served our investors well generating firm wide 26 percent annual net rates of return
5561697 our portfolio is solid and performing on plan we bought strong companies financed them conservatively and are working hard to create additional value
5561698 primary advisor to the secretary and the department on energy and technology policy development
5561699 expected to offer opinions and participate in policy debates thats the way the process works
5561700 he always struck me as being naturally and philosophically opposed to regulation at the outset and it took an enormous amount of discussion and analysis to convince him otherwise
5561701 i cant think of a case where chase advocated more environmental or health protections
5561702 there isnt a lot of volume so though were down a lot i dont think it necessarily signifies a change in sentiment
5561703 its healthy in these kinds of markets for people to have time to breathe or take time to consolidate before you continue the uptrend
5561704 regarding the treasurys new authorities the secretary has said many times he has no intentions of using it
5561705 continue to provide stability and liquidity to the housing market
5561706 the centerpiece of our regulatory approach is giving investors the information they need to make wise decisions
5561707 we have an opportunity to exponentially improve the way we perform that mission
5561708 the helpless rage of impatience into a delicious sense of spaciousness
5561709 the large number of children coming into contact with the legal system mostly as a result of abuse cases has motivated intense scientific effort to understand childrens true and false reports
5561710 the seriousness of abuse charges and the frequency with which childrens testimony provides central prosecutorial evidence makes childrens eyewitness memory abilities important considerations arguably even more important however are adults abilities to evaluate childrens reports
5561711 we want the course to act as a vehicle to re engage them but we will be setting ground rules
5561712 we dont want to simply take them out of school and that is all they do there will be a clear understanding that this is an add on conditional on carrying out their normal school work
5561713 i know a few women who have come out here to do hairdressing but they left to go back to the coast because the pay was bad and theres not much to do
5561714 i think if they improved wages for those types of jobs it might help

5561727 i dont think anyone can own yoga because yoga really is a belief system at its most quintessential its really a path to enlightenment and no one can own that
5561728 a court would have to be convinced that a sequence of the exercises is original protectable expression rather than merely collection of factual material
5561729 every good citizen should be willing to devote a brief time during some one day in the year when necessary to the making up of a listing of his income for taxes to contribute to his government not the scriptural tithe but a small percentage of his net profits
5561730 a larger portion of our necessary revenues collected from the incomes and inheritances of those deriving the most benefit and protection from the government
5561731 i have no disposition to tax wealth unnecessarily or unjustly but i do believe that the wealth of the country should bear its just share of the burden of taxation and that it should not be permitted to shirk that duty
5561732 with japan in control of key points of indochina we were reluctant to sell any additional equipment to indochina
5561733 delay and parlay and hold out against japanese demands since japan would not dare make a military attack at this time
5561734 there is no greater responsibility resting upon peoples and governments everywhere than to make sure that enduring peace will this time at long last be established and maintained fortunately the war has brought with it not alone a stark realization of what another war would mean to the world but as well the creation of an international agency through which the nations of the world can if they so desire make peace a living reality within a few weeks the organization for the maintenance of international peace and security established by the san francisco charter will be formally launched through the convocation of the first general assembly of the united nations i fully realize that the new organization is a human rather than a perfect instrumentality for the attainment of its great objective as time goes on it will i am sure be improved the charter is sufficiently flexible to provide for growth and development in the light of experience and performance but i am firmly convinced that with all its imperfections the united nations organization offers the peace loving nations of the world how a fully workable mechanism which will give them peace if they want peace to be sure no piece of social machinery however well constructed can be effective unless there is back of it a will and a determination to make it work
5561735 united nations organization offers the peace loving nations of the world how a fully workable mechanism which will give them peace if they want peace
5561736 i am firmly convinced that in the world of today all nations will be forced to the conclusion that cooperation for law justice and peace is the only alternative to a constant race in armaments including atomic armaments and to other disruptive practices that will bring the nations participating in them on either side to a common ruin the equivalent of universal suicide
5561737 of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive it may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies the robber barons cruelty may sometimes sleep his cupidity may at some point be satiated but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience

5561742 there were only five biosafety level 4 labs places equipped to study highly lethal agents such as ebola that have no human vaccine or treatment a government accountability office report stated last fall fifteen are in operation or under construction now according to the report there are hundreds more biosafety level 3 labs which handle agents such as bacillus anthracis which does have a human vaccine

5561769 una advertencia al gobierno por sus dilaciones para implementar una verdadera pol tica agropecuaria
5561770 esto es una advertencia que puede transformarse en una nueva etapa si no hay soluciones si no est n claros los precios de la leche y los novillos y si no se bajan las retenciones a peque os y medianos productores
5561771 los problemas agropecuarios no est n resueltos s lo es menos malo que cuando estaba la resoluci n 125
5561772 si esto sigue as esta semana la otra o en alg n momento terminamos en un paro en una protesta lo m s probable es que definamos alguna movida hacia el congreso porque con el voto de cobos no se archiv el problema
5561773 convocar y resolver porque hasta ahora s lo ha hecho gestos y es hora de que ponga sobre la mesa las medidas para solucionar estos problemas
5561774 a todos estos problemas como la inflaci n las retenciones la falta de pol tica agropecuaria y todas las plagas de egipto ahora hay que sumar que hay un retraso cambiario

5561789 itll be an adventure for the kids and we want it to be fun but at the same time the kids will hopefully take some things home and apply it and share it and create a lifestyle that will be more environmentally conscious

5561792 many res life professionals now seem to that think it is perfectly acceptable to treat dorm residents as citizens to be trained and programmed rather than as students who are attending college to be educated by the faculty
5561793 john k wilson to name one defender of delawares res life curricular programming has claimed that this kind of programming is a good idea what one might ask is good about it this as i have suggested is a vision of the good society as it might be conceived these days by nurse ratched
5561794 the motion is to affirm resignations of senator mark forbes as speaker senator ray tenorio as vice speaker and senator jesse lujan as legislative secretary
5561795 it was a matter of pulling data we have available on the back end around how often they visit the communities and how much they do when they are there
5561796 especially among the younger generation raised writing and speaking english in schools
5561797 all participants are bilingual and it is facilitated in english
5561798 these are our people our countrymen and their commitment to mexico is vital to this country
5561799 he wants us to send more money well get us more jobs
5561800 you send money depending on how your work is if theres no work you dont send any
5561801 they feel it there because the economy is bad there too but whether its a little or a lot you send money to your family no matter what the government says
5561802 on the one hand they are asking for our support on the other hand they arent giving us the tools to invest
5561803 we want the united states to recognize our matricula consulares as our official ids but they dont in mexico
5561804 there is no consistency they want migrants to invest in mexico but we cant get a legal id
5561805 consolidated comparable store growth for the first seven weeks of trading in 2008 09 was 19 2 per cent continuing our impressive comp store growth of the previous year mr uechtritz said
5561806 as this is only seven weeks and we have the all important christmas trading period ahead of us we maintain our previous sales guidance of circa 2 35 billion or a 28 per cent increase on 2007 08
5561807 we are extremely pleased with this very strong result having traded well during what is considered to be the weakest retail climate for many years mr uechtritz said
5561808 whilst the retail outlook is less certain than at previous reporting dates jb has proven to be resilient with home entertainment becoming more of a staple category as consumers keep up with technology
5561809 this is a very young calf its probably two to three weeks old it absolutely needs its mother or another whale to adopt it
5561810 its heart wrenching normally whales stay very very close to their mothers theyre inseparable and they suckle for 11 months before being weaned
5561811 we managed to coax it out to sea yesterday by towing a yacht
5561812 the sad news is this morning its returned the last sighting was mackerel beach in pittwater
5561813 weve got some folks out there at the moment trying to assess its condition but the fact that it went out to sea yesterday there were whales in the vicinity but its come back in again its pretty sad news
5561814 it would suggest that its not been able to make contact with those whales or they werent interested in it
5561815 its probably a question of days rather than weeks its a very grim prognosis
5561816 if a lactating female with a calf goes past and this calf approaches that animal it may accept it but its a very slim chance
5561817 this is a very young calf it amp squo s probably two to three weeks old it absolutely needs its mother or another whale to adopt it
5561818 it amp squo s heart wrenching normally whales stay very very close to their mothers they amp squo re inseparable and they suckle for 11 months before being weaned
5561819 we make our own decisions about what we consider newsworthy
5561820 the nomination of the first african american presidential nominee after abitter primary campaign and his efforts to unite a party afterward were simplymore newsworthy than a candidate whose nomination was already assured and whospent much of that time raising money in the end we can and should be judged on the fairness of our coverage butthat is a judgment that must be made over the course of the whole campaign nota single period of time

5561837 an explicitly postmodern text using pataphysics as opposed to a modernist like davenport
5561838 i am a postmodern text i was written as a postmodern text i am to be read as a postmodern text
5561839 a cultural intellectual or artistic state lacking a clear central hierarchy or organizing principle and embodying extreme complexity contradiction ambiguity diversity interconnectedness or interreferentiality in a way that is often indistinguishable from a parody of itself
5561840 the northeast coast tended to do well during all three weeks
5561841 it appeared people had no trouble getting their bag limits throughout the three week period in that area
5561842 elsewhere where people were getting their full bag limits it was taking them longer or they were experiencing very poor catches
5561843 from what weve heard fishery officers speaking to fishers during their inspections people are generally very pleased
5561844 its unfortunate that weather conditions in some areas at some times prevented people from getting out but this is newfoundland and thats just the way it is in most cases weve been hearing that people are just pleased to get a day on the water as well
5561845 that is fairly remarkable i think in that kind of sample size
5561846 generally speaking we are very pleased with the compliance rate that we saw
5561847 we want a remake of the adventures of bayou billy
5561848 it was a scary time to be sure especially with what happened last october the next street down when a local resident was killed after being buried in a similar accident
5561849 any 911 call is scary but when you get two within seven or eight months of each other it does get a little scary especially when you know the individual yourself its a small town we all know each other
5561850 when we arrived on the scene it was evident a town worker was trapped
5561851 you couldnt really tell the extent if he was kneeling down if he was standing or anything like that paramedics were here and the ground was very unsafe at that time so we were keeping bystanders back
5561852 when they got him out he walked out of the hole of his own accord
5561853 it seems to me canada post has huge problems and they dont want to admit it
5561854 i think they are either terribly inefficient or they have crooks or they have malicious people who think it is funny to throw peoples mail away or something
5561855 thats kind of the route you choose to go after a while
5561856 but yeah a lot of times your hands are tied so it is something you should be able to have faith in
5561857 its more of an entertainment center but it does a lot of the same things computers do
5561858 you know theres lots of multimedia features and games that make computers a good investment
5561859 its too expensive but i hear youve got it everywhere in your cities
5561860 it takes thousands of your credits to add up to one of ours making it cost prohibitive here
5561861 where i come from im pretty low on the social ladder here on your reservations my money goes a whole lot further
5561862 you dip one of these twigs into it anytime you want a little taste
5561863 theyll make wonderful pets its just i dont eat animals
5561864 a few centuries of being domesticated for experimentation and spare parts kind of turns a civilization off exploiting other animal species
5561865 you dont mean for the gods who live on the spider web in the sky
5561866 those are our descendents or ascendants depending on your perspective we created them
5561867 they came from us just like we came from you
5561868 that evolution nonsense your kind is always pushing on us some of the church goers buy into that stuff but not me
5561869 but when you recognize it you see patterns when the robots became their own masters they nearly drove my species into extinction consuming all our resources just like when my species descended from yours it wasnt until we became advanced enough to realize the side effects of our population boom that we turned benevolent established these sanctuaries
5561870 my husband has been ill and i too have had had health issues
5561871 we just went to a job fair and asked if they would take the three of us and they said yes
5561872 its not like they havent met before and have to get to know each other each year they know each other already
5561873 i had one student who was sick one day and started to cry because he didnt want to leave school
5561874 so everything that you usually need you need to pack it up and ship it up
5561875 and the kids speak their own language and only speak english when theyre at school
5561876 its their culture so we dont want to interfere with that
5561877 theyve been through a lot more than most of the kids down here
5561878 as of next year 2009 the band council is taking over so the school board teachers will be laid off and they the band council will do all of the hiring and everything after that
5561879 i guess we kind of wait and see for next year
5561880 a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5561881 clearly quite tight and effectively getting tighter as a result of ongoing pressure on lenders cost of funds in the market
5561882 given there had been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect tighter financial conditions were not warranted
5561883 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5561884 all they are really saying here is that if they dont move towards less restrictive conditions the risk of a deeper or more persistent slowing of the economy would increase
5561885 they dont want that which is an argument to cut rates but by the same token the language is not strong enough to suggest they are heading towards a 50 basis point cut next month
5561886 i think it is consistent with 25 basis points next month
5561887 hopes itll inspire you to use technology to make yourself more free
5561888 this was the first campaign i felt i needed to support i dont have a lot of money but i donate what i can because i believe in barack
5561889 in any geographic area its a natural phenomenon for oil to peak at some point
5561890 the peak oil theory looks at the u s experience and believes the world will peak also
5561891 as demand increases prices increase and when prices increase companies develop and produce more oil which can slow the peak were getting better at finding oil and more efficient at drilling it
5561892 i dont believe in the cataclysm if you have a sharp drop in production and prices increase you will get major substitutions in the demand for oil
5561893 the problem with the transportation sector is that oil supplies 97 percent of its energy and theres no viable substitute unless the price of oil gets high enough its knocking at that door now and were starting to see tangible indicators of a switch
5561894 americans are competing with asia and the rest of the world not just for fuel but for materials and food as well thats the world were in
5561895 the cw and our studio partner cbs paramount network television have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere
5561896 were not hiding anything simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9 02 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5561897 but it would be the biggest mistake of his life if he goes on the mound hoping to show the rangers something thats high school stuff

5561905 i think its on purpose since you are always full of angst
5561906 wests most disappointing ally in the war on terror lets be clear about this musharraf was a catastrophic failure for pakistan
5561907 he claimed to have turned the country around and to have turned it against the taliban terrorists it had created and succoured in afghanistan
5561908 but the endless cycle of pakistani politics contains only a couple of variations one is for a civilian government to fail amid corruption and incompetence and be replaced by a military dictator who is at first welcomed for his effectiveness
5561909 but then the military dictator in turn fails and is replaced by a democratically elected government which is at first welcomed for its democratic credentials and its promise of economic reform it too then fails and is replaced by a new military dictator
5561910 but all the while that this cycle endlessly repeats pakistan sinks slowly into state failure and social chaos
5561911 with pakistan president pervez musharraf gone washington must work with islamabads democratically elected government to wage the war on terror a task us experts say may be more challenging but could reap better results
5561912 some us experts said that musharraf who ruled with almost unfettered power during most of his tenure played a double game and was not a genuine us war on terror partner despite more than 10 billion dollars in us aid to his country since the september 11 2001 attacks safe haven in pakistan grew rapidly under musharrafs watch they said
5561913 selig harrison head of the asia program at the center for international policy says musharrafs departure presents an opportunity for the u s to undo some of the damage caused by its relationship with the former general
5561914 harrison says musharrafs resignation should allow the u s to let that anti americanism die down and to shut up and do absolutely nothing but respond to initiatives from the new government
5561915 musharrafs departure is certainly a watershed however the mess he has left behind is one that will haunt pakistan and the world in the months ahead
5561916 sadly the same thing simply cannot be said about the nominee sam rasoul in the sixth he was chosen because democrats were desperate to have a candidate and simply took the first person who walked through the door they didnt do their homework in regard to matters of experience viability qualifications and credibility now they have a floundering campaign that cant raise money cant maintain a staff how many people have left now five six and cant even garner the full support of the party its a shame but some who tried to warn the party that this might happen were either ignored or criticized now these numbers surface
5561917 should not have been given the right to confer degrees
5561918 no other education can replace public education and the system must be complete from top to bottom it must not be cut off anywhere or in between it must be usefully supplemented by any schools private religious or what not as long they coordinate their efforts with the public system and the pyramid of your system must continue to be in the future as it has been in the past capped by your own university of the philippines if it endures free and untrammeled for the diffusion and increase of knowledge the philippines will have its best chance of maintaining a secure place in world affairs
5561919 our goal is to be one of the first in the area to have a bike center because there are a lot of people who ride bikes to work
5561920 thats when we said we have to build a bike center
5561921 thats the kind of thing that makes a world class city having progressive ideas about bicycling as a viable form of commuting
5561922 we have 100 people right now who commute by bike from anderson township to the city
5561923 we anticipate when all this is built as an off road corridor a lot more people will commute
5561924 and we also believe people will come here to ride the bicycle corridor so theres a lot of economic benefit environmental benefit and just physical well being at stake in this
5561925 through our service we are able to increase employee retention and attraction there will be a boost in employee productivity and we create advocates of the company and the citys brand
5561926 the employer has the hero factor as the employee becomes networked socially and professionally
5561927 each blackbook is uniquely tailored to each individual we know there is plenty of information out there if you have the time resources and bandwidth
5561928 our consultants spend the time to get to know the person and their family we learn if their kids like blink 182 or what he got his wife for her birthday
5561929 they create a personalized black book that gets at risk employees entrenched in the communities and get more out of the cincinnati experience i have not found any other company that provides this level of attention
5561930 if a group of executives want to understand the african or latin american culture we design with blackbook a series of experiences to give them that better understanding
5561931 we are also working with trihealth on their big hospital administration conference we were planning to design a recruitment event as theyll have a lot of executives in one place at one time we will help them create a trihealth branded experience for when their executives come to cincinnati
5561932 the trade show day was already busy and i didnt want to waste everyones time deciding what to do everything was taken care of and the clients felt important and appreciated
5561933 they blackbook are focused on the details of night so that i can focus on building the relationship with the client they find the right place for the meeting i can tell them i want jean ro but not pigalls and they know what i mean they listen to what people want and learn the difference of what they mean when they describe things in general terms
5561934 cincinnati has such a diverse landscape that is divided into silos which could affect the impression of the premier of anything this city is and should be on the same tier as chicago and new york
5561935 i started to see trends in what i was doing my clients questions became less about finance and more about the city
5561936 they wanted to know where to go for thai food or how to get tickets to that sold out show then my clients started to say this is a guy you want to know
5561937 over the meal i explained about the culture shock concept that i had let fall to the wayside we talked about what if there was someone on the ground that could be that resource
5561938 we spent that whole night driving in a cab and talked about our grand plans for this company
5561939 we can say we have deep knowledge in hospitality hr restaurants consumer goods and across a number of areas the experience is not based just on us but also on well connected individuals
5561940 one of the great things about cincinnati is you can make things happen here if you are passionate about what you do companies and employees take note
5561941 this is a world class city if we can be part of the re branding of cincinnati as such a great place i would consider us successful
5561942 te midden van de eu en de navo en omwille van de vn resoluties moeten wij onze steun aan die landen herhalen en tegelijkertijd ons engagement duidelijk maken om rusland te tonen wat de kost van het avontuur en de agressie is

5561947 the brooklyn team that i came up with in 1948 basically stayed together until 1958
5561948 it wasnt until we moved to los angeles that they started making changes on our off days the whole team would go on picnics together and our children were raised together in the ebbets field clubhouse before every game roy campanella would stand up and say the same team that won yesterday is the same team thats going to win today he put that in our minds and we knew thats what we had to do
5561949 even with all the world series experience and playing on all those great teams i think this is probably the cream on the top of everything
5561950 to be back on brooklyn soil after all these years and in a ballpark in brooklyn is very meaningful to me its almost like a fantasy
5561951 one is when we are going to die which is a good thing the other thing is we never know what we can really accomplish in life if everything went right and we push ourselves as hard as we can look at me i got more out of this skinny little body because i played on a great team and no one tried to change who i was you have to believe who you are is better than something you read about or something youve seen somewhere else
5561952 i was a skinny kid from indiana who could throw hard but to be picked out of the midwestern culture and placed in a big city like brooklyn was unbelievable
5561953 only to find out that bay ridge brooklyn was exactly like my hometown i knew the barber and the butcher and everyone knew me if i pitched a good game id come home from ebbets field and be in the middle of a street party with balloons in the trees and the whole nine yards it was amazing
5561954 it would be unreal for me to say there was something i didnt get to do
5561955 i stayed in the big leagues for 12 years and even though i didnt get into cooperstown how many guys have a street named after them in brooklyn i guess a lot of people in the safety department are still dodgers fans how could you wish for anything other than that
5561956 it will get a women on the ticket that shares the same views as obama
5561957 every time we give him opportunities he seems to make plays
5561958 hes one of those guys who doesnt look great when you go to individual drills but he just finds ways to make plays
5561959 c ontrary to what you might think the enquirers record in courtroom lawsuits is no better or worse than other media outlets
5561960 is michelle obama raising the bar for african american women

5561962 the environmental costs of using recommended pesticides in the united states are estimated to be 9 billion a year included are 67 million birds killed each year from the recommended use of pesticides
5561963 oh really well naruto if thats the case you may want to start with keeping your big trap shut since youre getting on ankos nerves which is why she threw a kunine knife at you
5561964 oh to meet up with some friends where are you heading
5561965 hey we should hang out sometime you wan hang out can i get your number
5561966 you wanna hang out some time you wan go see a movie we should go to a movie
5561967 aww shoot youre seeing someone huh you should go see a movie with me itd be fun
5561968 a further aspect of the antithesis between apollo and dionysus concerns the dyad distance nearness unlike certain eastern forms greek and western art in general favor a certain distance from the work whereby we do not come into direct contact with it for the greeks however beauty was expressed by those senses that permit a distance to be maintained between the object and the observer sight and hearing rather than touch taste and smell
5561969 a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5561970 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5561971 some people are talking about a 50 basis point cut this would put a bit of a dampener on that which is a positive for the aussie dollar
5561972 it doesnt have the degree of urgency which would suggest that the reserve bank sees itself about to embark on a 50 basis point move or a huge reduction in interest rates by the end of the year
5561973 that in turn is pretty supportive for the australian dollar in the short term
5561974 most men have no interior spirituality they need something outside like a law to kick them to get them going to offer them security to promote them to reward them to make them happy spirituality is a matter of having a source of energy within which is a motivating and directing force for living the man of spirit or the spiritual man if you will is energized by something beyond money sex and power
5561975 right to work for less is a method that is used to prevent employees from being able to bargain and negotiate with their employers for fair working conditions wages and benefits the ability to organize is the only tool that employees have to advocate for themselves and thats why right to work for less legislation is bad because it takes all that away

5561983 this is the start of a major move the dollar will get even stronger
5561984 anyone sitting in a us fund in the last three or four weeks will have seen a nice bounce anything up to 12
5561985 if youre in a storm the safest place to be is in the deep sea not the shallows and the economy in the world that represents the deep sea is the us
5561986 it has shown remarkable resilience it went into the credit crunch first and itll be the first to come out

5561994 during my time as interior minister i learned that plo people were holding heavy artillery in their homes and protected by diplomatic immunity as representatives of the arab league i was told not to worry and i managed to convince them to lay down their heavy artillery and make do with light weaponry
5561995 i always knew though not by official documents and information kept from me about the existence of an agreement based on dont harm me and i wont harm you between the italian republic and organizations such as the popular front for the liberation of palestine and the plo
5561996 the terms of the agreement were that the palestinian organizations could even maintain armed bases of operation in the country and they had freedom of entry and exit without being subject to normal police controls because they were handled by the secret services
5561997 during my time as interior minister i learned that plo people were holding heavy artillery in their homes and protected by diplomatic immunity as representatives of the arab league i was told not to worry and i managed to convince them to lay down their heavy artillery and make do with light weaponry
5561998 bien simples content has a natural affinity with us hispanics inclination towards finding their own solutions to everyday problems
5561999 god must have created the universe in such a way that the light from those stars was already on the way to earth at the time of creation therefore the light that we see today even though it appears to have come from a star much farther away has only travelled 6000 light years why would god create such a deception to test our true faith of course

5562019 hey a holes that said i was appearing at a strip club last week dead wrong i was no where near nor will i ever be doing a signing and or appearance in a strip club i actually found it quite funny while i was at home updating my myspace all of these so called news sites saying i would be there apparently tmz even wanted to talk about it so crazy so for anybody that actually went there to see me and didnt i apologize for the lack of responsibility on many peoples parts if i had known about this sooner i could have tried to fix it before anyone went there to see me but alas i was alerted to it probably the same time as you guys so anyone who went to that place to see me sorry you got duped ill be sure to make another app soon in ny to make up for that
5562020 hes the one who makes the most sense at 320 pounds
5562021 typically the hardest place to play for a big guy is the defensive front
5562022 if you can play on defense youve got to think you can flip over and play on offense and you go from being a decent athlete to a real good athlete
5562023 gage crews we wanted him to get his weight down a little and he didnt and hes having problems with his back right now and when your back is bad you cant condition like you should and you cant lift weights like you should
5562024 were three deep at defensive tackle right now im not sure were real smart to keep a couple of pretty good third team tackles in there when maybe one or two of them could go over and help us on the offensive line
5562025 you forget but heres a guy whos got four years of eligibility left
5562026 he might be a little bit like mike rinfrette he might go play guard this year and then go back and play defensive tackle next year or play guard for two years and go back and play defensive tackle
5562027 we probably dont need to do it for old guys
5562028 but well got to the stadium early enough to take groups out on the field
5562029 to go through what i went through and be back on top again im just so blessed right now
5562030 i came to the birds nest to lay a golden egg and thats what i did
5562031 i am surprised we havent won more gold but you know what i hope this sets a trend
5562032 i had a lot of people in my corner encouraging me and looking after me
5562033 nobody is going to beat them no way its just not going to happen
5562034 we feel like were playing very well right now but you have to keep in mind its single elimination
5562035 going against greece and going against spain it was really easy to get up for
5562036 we didnt take a step backwards today and that was good it was really good
5562037 i just didnt want to have to go through the pain so i just did everything i could to have the best restart i could and it worked out great
5562038 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5562039 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5562040 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5562041 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5562042 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5562043 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5562044 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5562045 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5562046 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
5562047 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
5562048 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
5562049 we graduated 16 seniors and that can be pretty devastating for a team especially for us
5562050 a lot of them the graduated seniors started for us
5562051 they return most of their skill players theyll be athletic theyll be good
5562052 last year we reached the third round of the playoffs and had 10 wins this year wed like to keep moving forward we dont want to settle for the things we did last year we lost a lot of key components and were expected to do a lot of things we have a lot of work to do to live up to expectations
5562053 i think wilkes central will be good and starmount too
5562054 we have more speed were stronger and we have more experience our seniors played as sophomores
5562055 we have a little more team speed but were not as physical not as experienced
5562056 we hope were over that i like the way the first week has gone the way the summer went the way the winter went
5562057 were going to run the same stuff we just need to do it better
5562058 ive never been the kind of player who has been that close to her teammates
5562059 youre as close as you need to be to get the job done
5562060 brazil has a very talented team but we are showing our talent too
5562061 you cant just stop one person we dont have a big star but were all capable of being stars
5562062 i think this is great because well be able to bring them all together and well see what we have real early
5562063 well play two exhibition games down there against two of their club teams
5562064 we dont know much about who we are playing but thats ok we just want to see where we stack up and hopefully it will be a great experience for our guys
5562065 and we still get the guarantee on top of that
5562066 im hoping our young guys can respond and play well and our upperclassmen will be there at the end of games for us
5562067 thats another reason why these extra practices will give us a jump start i know the guys are looking forward to getting on the court and practicing as a full team
5562068 i think you just have to keep doing the same kinds of things youve been doing
5562069 you cant try to make it bigger than it is its a good opportunity and hopefully i can perform well and we can perform well as a team
5562070 i dont think you can try to make it more than it is
5562071 were getting to the point where were reloading every year instead of rebuilding
5562072 i would like to think if were going to make some noise
5562073 i came into this thing as i want to be a carolina panther man if they had me second third string i was going to come out here to play to the best of my ability and do what i do and be prepared i really dont look at things as competition im just trying to be a part of this team
5562074 they wanted to get bigger and more physical and im a big and physical guy
5562075 so i just fit right into what were trying to do this year
5562076 hes a veteran guy hes got experience hes taken the mentor role with otah to help him through everything and hes just a good fit for the type of player we want on the o line i think hes helping otah a lot i know when i played next to kevin donnalley who was in his 12th or 13th year my rookie year it really helped its just great to be next to someone whos been through it its an extra comfort zone for a rookie
5562077 hes got great experience and hes got a great mind set and work ethic that i think brings a lot to that room and that position
5562078 hes a guy that were very pleased with at this point
5562079 i feel like it was a redshirt year last year
5562080 its real funny because i was coming off a sports hernia injury and i was able to heal up so carolina got a brand new player
5562081 any time you come to a new team a new offense especially for me my big thing in minicamps and all prior to training camp is to learn the system and what they do and how they wanted it done
5562082 so i started off a little slow but coach mags dave magazu offensive line coach did a good job of working with me on some things so i got a chance to go home this summer and look at how they wanted things done and i came back for training camp ready to go
5562083 oh when you have three kids having one more is no different already
5562084 i wished we wouldnt have gotten caught i was looking at 15 years and i wanted to see my daughter graduate
5562085 fortunately for us not fortunately for them they went down a dead end street
5562086 they actually acted like they didnt know what was going on until 15 to 20 minutes later when identified as the escapees
5562087 doesnt need to be extremely reptilian only more reptilian than his opponent is
5562088 theyve come up from the creek and broken into peoples cars
5562089 ours actually got broken into a year or two ago
5562090 youll get a lot of people asking for money or food and its one of those things you have to endure if youre going to eat at serranos
5562091 basically a lot of the businesses just south of here complain about the loitering the people hanging out down there dealing drugs the litter
5562092 i came down here to try to identify what made this area so attractive to criminals
5562093 in combination you also had some poor lighting some light fixtures that arent working
5562094 more park like instead of feeling like im looking over my shoulder
5562095 letzter versuch der besuch eines der wie schwammerln aus dem boden wachsenden in lokale
5562096 oh hey we have this hoop we want you to jump through

5562098 youre not drunk if you can lie on the floor without holding on
5562099 if you dont want to do something one excuse is as good as another
5562100 is having to be used instead of the xhtml valid
5562101 we went to the new house last night to unlock the gate so the guy could get into the back yard of the new house to work on the new hot tub

5562106 plant the seeds of love do not rip out the plants with hate
5562107 you talk about pruning the twigs as if they dont come from deep roots
5562108 the logic is so utterly flawed that i think a new fallacy was invented
5562109 if you are concerned about congestion pollution sprawl or preservation of open space if you drive on the roads of california this is really bad news
5562110 hope i dont lie in my own excrement when im old
5562111 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5562112 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5562113 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5562114 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5562115 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5562116 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5562117 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5562118 yes the last hour has seen some nice growth really picking up strength as it passes bermuda some very impressive convection in this area looking pretty good for hitting category 1 by midnight if the land mass in cuba doesnt slow it down too much the warm water is perfect for building it
5562119 this is a problem that school districts across the country face
5562120 thats why the administration is focused on increasing school achievement levels hiring strong teachers and principals all in an effort to prevent this type of predicament in years to come
5562121 a blind rabbi walks onto a roof and announces hes running for congress
5562122 it would not be realistic to expect the dccc to spend a million and a half to take that seat without a poll everyone respects showing shulman to be very close
5562123 dems targeting scott garrett and nj 05 in general is something ive seen a few times and garrett always seems to win comfortably
5562124 like new jersey as a whole the district has been leaning democratic in recent years
5562125 i firmly oppose all nafta style trade deals including peru
5562126 for the first time in congressman garretts political career he is being held accountable for his extremist record in congress
5562127 oh these religious morons and their obsession with abortion of course i could care less about it but i also know its impolitic to say so so ill emit a brief rhetoric fog and hope no one will notice
5562128 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5562129 should in god we trust be removed from u s currency
5562130 we don t want to condone people taking our intellectual property and using it without our permission
5562131 but we also don t like the idea of keeping fans of our products from being able to engage with our content
5562132 for the most part people who are uploading videos are fans of our movies they re not trying to be evil pirates and they re not trying to get revenue from it
5562133 his two fingers are pretty smashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it into the story

5562140 myspace is committed to keeping all users as safe and secure as possible today myspace was alerted to an issue within the myspace mobile wap site and is working to roll out an immediate fix
5562141 if the applications you refer to show the basic information that is already available publicly there is not a violation that said were looking into this
5562142 if the average citizen is worried about people spying never add anyone even a friend without telephone or e mail confirmation that it is legitimate
5562143 the gap in revenue per employee between google and sap and salesforce com for instance indicates that google would more likely be more interested in what ebay does or in monetizing youtube than in zoho or salesforce coms barely profitable business companies invest in what generates the best return on investment
5562144 googles margins are a once in a lifetime occurrence and google will move in that high growth why microsoft is so desperate about search it has a higher growth rate we are more worried about microsoft than google microsoft will address the internet but pulling down office margins is a challenge for them no company peacefully accepts a lowering of margins
5562145 our intention is to help erode microsofts profit margin coming in from below
5562146 if salesforce is a proxy it would be difficult for google to justify the investment more costs are associated with support than in r amp d even with on demand software the moment you have paying customers the expectations are different and google is finding that out with recent gmail problems
5562147 one of the privileges we enjoy as a private company is to not disclose revenue profit numbers which lets us do the kind of analysis on competitors they cant do on us
5562148 any search made with the intent of finding something in a specific geographical location seeking info online with intention of completing information online
5562149 then we really would be on the way to being the rising star of new england
5562150 its important for people to understand that we got this

5562154 a persons actual or perceived orientation toward heterosexuality homosexuality bisexuality or transgender status
5562155 a hate crime like this serves to intimidate and disrupt an entire community no one should ever live their lives in fear and intimidation regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity while we work to show everyone the gravity of hate crimes and the importance of preventing their reoccurrence we also work towards building a world where everyone enjoys human rights and the ability to live with dignity and respect

5562427 a few years ago i had the opportunity to fly along americas borders with my good friend john hensley who was the assistant commissioner of u
5562428 as we were flying over the desert we landed in the middle of nowhere

5562437 getting software development projects in on time can be a rare thing so in actually achieving that theres a lot of money to be made
5562438 it often allows you to draw out any schedule you want which is often unrealistic because you dont build in things along the way
5562439 your release cycle must be as accurate as you can make it not some pie in the sky number that you made up during lunch before you announce it test it out there is nothing worse for a failing release process than more unrealistic dates
5562440 we started out by suggesting a weekly cycle that plan proved unfeasible the clients database environment could not be refreshed quickly enough
5562441 then we tried two week cycles there were no immediate objections from the participants but it failed the first two times in the end two weeks was an achievable cycle once we overcame some environment turnaround bottlenecks and automated some of the tests
5562442 finally we established a cycle whereby every two weeks production ready code from the engineering team was put into system test then two weeks later we released that code into production your release cycle is not about when your customer wants the release its about when you can deliver it to the desired level of quality
5562443 project requirements change for a variety of reasons and schedules and budgets change during the lifetime of the project based on better information as to effort complexity and interdependencies

5562445 scinet is basically the largest collection of research scientists in the country and weve always had the need for a very powerful computing system
5562446 this will bring easily the most powerful computing system that the country has ever owned into canada
5562447 well be able to integrate models which are much more highly resolved spatially than those which weve been able to use in the past so it will have a huge impact on our ability to do climate system simulation

5562450 most systems are built in data centres and you spend as much power cooling the system as you do actually running it
5562451 because were going to use water for every one kilowatt of power that we use well only be using 200 watts or less for cooling power thats an efficiency ratio thats never been done before
5562452 this was extremely important to us especially for myself as an environmental researcher
5562453 we expect that this machine will be one of the most energy efficient in the world

5562502 i remember when prime minister zulfikar ali bhuttos government was sacked by then army chief general ziaul haq and he was put behind bars as a kid i saw people distributing sweets
5562503 it was the most unpopular government in the country and zia acted on the call of the opposition leaders and the larger segments of society
5562504 but in august 1988 when zia was killed in a plane crash i as a university student saw people celebrating his death and distributing sweets in karachis gulshan e iqbal ground where benazir bhutto was to address a public rally the same evening people were happily announcing their contributions to buy sweets to celebrate the end of a dictator
5562505 whether i win or lose the impeachment this country will be defeated
5562506 all dictators meet such a fate he should not be spared for his misdeeds
5562507 he should face the courts and should be tried for abrogating the constitution and for his anti democratic acts

5562522 i value the diary tremendously but im scared stiff its going to get lost
5562523 the army does not routinely monitor blogs regarding postings of specific personnel or groups of personnel it is not standard practice for the military to target or single out individual military blogs unless a particular blog has been brought to the attention of the chain of command or other dod department of defense officials for gross opsec operational security violations
5562524 the success of that is what will be the turning point for the soldiers to come home the faster we reconstruct the faster the soldiers can come back
5562525 there are instantaneous communications taking place around the world and we need to figure out how to take advantage of that opportunity instead of looking at it as a nemesis

5562543 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up

5562604 arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5562605 the honor and dignity of the country will be affected and in my view the honor of the office of president will also be affected

5562611 the addition of a formal document type layer in content central allows our customer base to organize content smarter
5562612 weve found that a single business department may be divided into numerous subgroups each with its own document access requirements organizing document collections by document types enables department managers to refine their access control policies keeping these distinct divisions in mind
5562613 this gives the rba reserve bank of australia room for a loosening in monetary policy in response to the current weakening in domestic activity
5562614 we expect continued competitive market conditions and input cost pressures in asia he said
5562615 despite the depressed us and housing markets we have long term confidence in these key markets he said
5562616 we believe that the underlying demand level in the usa is about 1 8 million starts excluding manufactured housing and in australia is around 185 000 starts per annum
5562617 eventually we are going to be bankrupt and in debt
5562618 the 5 280 mark is an obvious one all over the city
5562619 so i suspect it arose from discussions of how much we liked the broncos historic listing of the altitude at mile high stadium to remind the visiting players what theyre dealing with we went with the purple seats they sort of jump out at you it was sort of an insiders concept another way that is idiosyncratic to colorado
5562620 if you want the shade you go to section 347
5562621 they are kind of high but my boys love it
5562622 not too many people want to sit that high but you take in the scenery more than anything else and if youre that high you might as well be in the purple row
5562623 im just thankful im still able to talk to you like i am
5562624 i definitely feel i let the team down not only the team but all my friends all the people back home supporting me i used to go jogging early in the morning and people would recognize me and honk their horns at me they were all behind me and i feel those are the people i let down
5562625 what went on in this olympics its hard to say
5562626 we thought we had a chance for several guys to make it to the medal round but some of them fell to things beyond our control illness other things then we had the judging
5562627 honestly this dont make other kids want to come here or do this olympic thing at all
5562628 to come here and know youre going to get treated like that by judges whats the point
5562629 the fights that ive seen raushee warren got robbed raynell williams got robbed
5562630 you can see the judges are not on our side
5562631 i hate to put it that way but its the truth
5562632 nobody wanted to accept computer scoring including myself but its not going away
5562633 coaches didnt take the correct approach of how to beat a guy in the ring with the computer we continued to train our guys the same way and you cant win that way the professional style of boxing wont win on the international level
5562634 we think those changes are all steps in the right direction
5562635 we supported the idea of a full time residency program in colorado springs
5562636 we invested in it with them we thought it was the right approach to prepare for beijing like usa boxing were disappointed given all they invested in getting ready for these games
5562637 while not every circumstance out of colorado has been the way we would have wanted it
5562638 id say that the majority of our team really believes they were best prepared to give their best here as a result of the program they have been a part of
5562639 if were going to be there for a whole year why not have our coaches come up there for a month or send us home for a month or two to train with our personal coaches
5562640 i was like we need some of our personal coaches to be on the same track as the head coaches
5562641 at first we were kind of cool then everything started falling downhill
5562642 it was like coach dan whats up some people felt like they were being treated like kids thats when little boys get mad and start acting up
5562643 its good theyre able to take them away but i think they should allow personal coaches to have more access to their kids and learn this type of international boxing warren is like my son other coaches have the feeling that i raised this kid ive been with him all my life then they take him away they have to find a way to mix it all together
5562644 the majority of the personal coaches have never been to an international bout but theyre advising this guy how to box at the olympics
5562645 you have the kid caught in between he has his allegiance to his personal coach
5562646 we have a number of parents and coaches who recognize that the best social environment for these kids is to be in a training facility where you wake up in the morning and youre thinking boxing all day long
5562647 we want to increase the communications with the parents and the personal coaches early on about what the expectations are
5562648 when the residency program kicked off london 2012 olympics was really the vantage point were ahead of schedule were on a long term mission
5562649 based on our programs and success our organization has had in the last year
5562650 were a sport that needs to grow and improve from a grassroots standpoint we need more young athletes trying boxing we need more big kids trying boxing instead of immediately turning to football or basketball
5562651 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
5562652 saya memang ingin mencoba jalur sepeda di ui karena pas dapat undangan ya sekalian saja sekarang saya coba
5562653 terlebih dahulu saya ingin bertemu dengan kapolri saya ingin pertanyakan siapa yang menyuruh pemeriksaan ini apakah kepala bin syamsir siregar atau presiden sby atau memang ada bukti bukti yang lain
5562654 jadi kami ingin bertanya kepada kapolri apakah ini pengaduan politik terhadap perbedaan pendapat apakah ini pengadilan terhadap kebebasan untuk mengemukakan pendapat dan apakah kapolri ingin mengembalikan jarum jam sejarah demokrasi di indonesia karena hari ini polri bisa menjadi lembaga otonom itu sebagian besar adalah hasil perjuangan aktivis demokrasi pemuda dan mahasiswa
5562655 saya tadi menyerahkan buku saya yang kemarin baru di launching buku lokomotif perubahan kepada kapolri dan wakapolri pak makbul padmanegara
5562656 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5562657 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5562658 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5562659 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5562660 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5562661 the funnest event here is beach volleyball because its the music the girls dancing people screaming everybody dancing everybodys into it
5562662 to me it felt like the usa came to beijing
5562663 for us being so far away from home it was like sitting in the middle of the united states i felt like i was on the beach in california
5562664 i wish the countries and the presidents could feel what we all feel
5562665 because nobody would ever be at war because everybody is having a good time and being together as one
5562666 even if he wants publicity hes still a great guy
5562667 im on unpaid leave but its worth it there are so many people who have no chance to watch the games
5562668 he has taken snaps with the first team all training camp he has been making plays for us and his work paid off
5562669 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness
5562670 i dont want to do anything with a guy im not dating
5562671 i dont want to do anything with a guy im not dating
5562672 my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair
5562673 can very well expect them to be when they walk up to the church and see that on the front
5562674 that you would deface a house of worship shocked us more than anything
5562675 its a sick person who did that and not an indication of what the community around us is like
5562676 i think the concept what it is supposed to be is great but its not working
5562677 im amazed we have surpassed the goal i really am
5562678 but as we look at how weve done its clear that where we have knocked it out of the park has been an increase in procurement for small businesses im not yet happy where the numbers are for women owned and minority owned businesses the numbers have improved pretty steadily since i came in but they are still not at the level that i am happy with
5562679 i dont think i could ever go back to doing that
5562680 were the only industry of this size and scope that doesnt have a real voice in this process at best were humored at worst were ignored
5562681 is it making our community stronger or are we trapped in that model
5562682 the philanthropic dollars provide us the money to experiment and try new things
5562683 philanthropy can fail in a way that government cant but we can catalyze government investment in growing what works
5562684 there are a lot of people in this sector who will get nervous about the federal government becoming too engaged in philanthropy
5562685 but theres also this other argument that we dont want an agency that is going to over regulate us
5562686 eating of rats will serve twin purposes it will save grains from being eaten away by rats and will simultaneously increase our grain stock
5562687 we are very serious to implement this project since the food crisis is turning serious day by day
5562688 an iranian agent secretly sent to take over the united states and fight a war against sunni muslims
5562689 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds
5562690 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
5562691 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
5562692 goes far beyond a political hatchet job by containing statements that corsi knows are untrue and doesnt have a shred of evidence to back them up
5562693 that constitutes a reckless disregard for the truth which combined with corsis avowed aim to destroy obamas election prospects in my opinion meets the legal definition of libel
5562694 ford is a great company and it is probably on the right track but it needs to move faster
5562695 whats called for are cars that fit the challenges of today with gas prices much higher than they used to be they need to get them to the u s market much quicker than planned
5562696 economic growth has been sluggish against the backdrop of high energy and material prices and weaker growth in exports
5562697 were not surprised with the bojs wording that economic growth was sluggish
5562698 what was more interesting was that it acknowledged that export growth was slowing the bank has been saying all along that exports were in an upward trend but now it has changed that view
5562699 citizens in chains the high cost of prisoner lawsuits to california taxpayers
5562700 the use of litigation screenings in mass torts a formula for fraud

5562702 a lot of money funds lost their way it upsets me
5562703 these funds will move heaven and earth to preserve their 1 net asset value
5562704 if they break the buck money would flow out the door to their competitors at the drop of a hat
5562705 fannie and freddie will be here in one name or another long after you and i are dead the government cant walk away from those
5562706 regarding your greedy greedy table i would just like to inform you of damages for which i hold you personally liable
5562707 hahaha asshole youre gonna be stuck on zero for all eternity doomed to rot in a hell of zero points
5562708 i think as canadians there is a bit of a tiredness in seeing all american stuff
5562709 hey a holes that said i was appearing at a strip club last week
5562710 dead wrong i was no where near nor will i ever be doing a signing and or appearance in a strip club i actually found it quite funny while i was at home updating my myspace all of these so called news sites saying i would be there
5562711 apparently tmz even wanted to talk about it so crazy so for anybody that actually went there to see me and didnt i apologize for the lack of responsibility on many peoples parts if i had known about this sooner i could have tried to fix it before anyone went there to see me but alas i was alerted to it probably the same time as you guys so anyone who went to that place to see me sorry you got duped ill be sure to make another app soon in new york to make up for that
5562712 the track looks amazing and the location is fantastic so i am really looking forward to this grand prix the team has worked hard to prepare for this race because it is a new track for all of us but from a drivers point of view the important thing is to drive it for the first time and then you can start to understand more about the circuit i enjoy going to new venues because they are a new challenge and there is always something to discover every race is unique and i like that even though this is a new track for us i know valencia pretty well from all the testing we have done at the other circuit there it is a lively city and there always seems to be something going on so it should be a fun weekend i am expecting a competitive weekend as well because at the moment we are looking quite strong scoring more points is our target and if we challenge for the podium again that would be great
5562713 im still smiling after hungary that was an incredible result and a fantastic feeling i hope it will be the first of many podiums in formula 1 the important thing was that we showed just how competitive we are at the moment and moved further ahead in fourth place in the constructors championship there is a great atmosphere in the team and we are all working hard together to move forward which is why it was so satisfying to get on the podium in hungary but valencia is a new race and we must start again i did plenty of street races when i was racing in champ cars and in that season almost all the tracks were new to me so i have learnt to adapt quickly it looks like an interesting circuit and its quite long so it should be a good show we will have plenty of work to do on friday to adjust the car to the track but we are in good form at the moment so i am optimistic for this weekend
5562714 we are well prepared for valencia of course we started our preparations for this new track by looking at the fia information and that allowed us to put forward some speed profiles in order to estimate downforce and braking requirements for example we also sent staff to look at the inaugural race meeting there at the end of july and that gave us additional data with regards to speed profiles driving lines and track surface we expect the track to be in the mid range of downforce and quite severe on brakes at the beginning we anticipate grip will be quite low but that should improve throughout the weekend in terms of performance we clearly want to build on the competitiveness shown in hungary we are genuinely challenging to be the third quickest car based on the last few races valencia will also show how well teams can react to new conditions so it will be an interesting weekend and we have every reason to be feeling very positive
5562715 being married to an islamist or to a criminal suspect is not a crime
5562716 the syrian authorities should immediately release these women unless they have evidence that they have committed crimes
5562717 we want to show that we are part of this community
5562718 today one of the leading salafist figures in the north dai al islam al shahhal identifies the salafist movement as the true face of islam
5562719 i believe we can make those policy changes we dont have to rely on prejudice anymore
5562720 we dont have to rely on the policies that were fine 25 years ago but we can change them safely and securely now
5562721 these mailings are the first correspondence members receive from their credit union so were committed to providing our members with accurate timely information
5562722 it was impossible for us to determine if an address was invalid by simply looking at it particularly if an address was incomplete due to something like a missing apartment number
5562723 the solution prompts for apartment numbers and directional information and will not allow an address to update unless it is accurate now entering incorrect addresses is almost impossible
5562724 qas pro has helped us enhance our fraud detection efforts
5562725 most fraud begins at the address change so weve centralized address changes in support services to minimize risk we work diligently to verify a members signature each time we receive a request to update an address with qas pro if an address is unmatched it can be flagged automatically so that we know to send the member a document requiring a signature before an address change is made this has reduced the risk of fraud

5562788 it was the bedni dance performed last year in the presence of cooperative minister gopal bhargava that was really obscene
5562789 there was nothing obscene in the dancing at aqueels rally and if it is proved otherwise i will give up public life
5562790 was their dress obscene or their gestures it was just that the songs played for a while during the rally were not patriotic songs nobody is looking at the fact that hundreds of people from all sections of society and religious faiths participated in the rally organised every year to spread the message of communal harmony

5562795 senator barack obama has all but settled on his choice for a running mate and set an elaborate rollout plan for his decision beginning with an early morning alert to supporters perhaps as soon as wednesday morning aides said
5562796 going into the final days mr obama was said to be focused mainly on three candidates senator evan bayh of indiana gov tim kaine of virginia and senator joseph r biden jr of delaware
5562797 some democrats said they still hoped that he would choose senator hillary rodham clinton of new york or gov kathleen sebelius of kansas who has been under steady consideration by mr obamas campaign

5562815 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
5562816 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
5562817 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
5562818 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5562819 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5562820 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5562821 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5562822 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5562823 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5562824 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5562825 everyone in task force helmand is affected by the death of a soldier and the thoughts and sympathies of us all are with the family at this most difficult time
5562826 people are frustrated and apprehensive and are saying what can we do to make it right
5562827 it is up to us the four nations people we need to work together to come up with a long term solutions against the gangs the drugs and the violence but our community has to take charge
5562828 these communities have to recognize that they have a problem with some of these young people that are out there with their gang ties and this lifestyle with drugs and the violence and they can go home to grandma and grandma will accept them and love them unconditionally kamins said
5562829 well the grandmas and other community leaders have to stop and say wait a minute
5562830 the hardened criminals and the entrenched gang members are committing these crimes and they are committing violence and they are hurting the community terribly
5562831 we have to balance that on the other hand with the fact that we have a lot of people involved in gangs who may be rehabilitated
5562832 they are our people they are our children they are our community members our relatives and it may look simple and easy from someone on the outside but to us it isnt that simple
5562833 i am here to tell you today as chief of samson cree nation we are going to reclaim our youth and foster security within our community these young people are our future
5562834 we are doing what we can to get the gangs out of our community
5562835 she was phoned up and informed this is a massive blow for her
5562836 uranium mining has taken our country away from us and destroyed it mining and the millions of dollars in royalties have not improved our quality of life
5562837 the greatest minds in the nuclear establishment have been searching for an answer to the radioactive waste problem for fifty years and theyve finally got one haul it down a dirt road and dump it on an indian reservation
5562838 for eight years in the white house every weapons proliferation problem we dealt with was connected to a civilian reactor program and if we ever got to the point where we wanted to use nuclear reactors to back out a lot of coal then wed have to put them in so many places wed run that proliferation risk right off the reasonability scale

5562842 we confront more than the usual number of people who dont respond or cant respond people are away from their homes heading back from summer vacation or preparing their children for the start of the school year
5562843 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5562844 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5562845 in hindsight i played perfectly into the hands of monckton and his happy radio host roy green who share the same goal not to win an argument about global warming science but merely to show that there still is an argument
5562846 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action
5562847 fail to act and whats been accomplished will be lost
5562848 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5562849 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5562850 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5562851 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5562852 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
5562853 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5562854 what do we have to give up to reach the cost of a trillion and a half to three trillion dollars theres going to have to be some pain some sacrifice on the part of the american taxpayer isnt there
5562855 the real way to bring gasoline prices down is not by going back to try more of the same things that have not worked in the past but to say wait a minute now is the time for a really dramatic shift over to renewable energy
5562856 he did not force gore to debate a crackpot from cloud cuckoo land who is still waiting for the evidence to arrive about human sources of radical climate change
5562857 the unsupported assumption catastrophic global warming follows burning fossil fuels requires immediate action
5562858 the unsupported assumption that the world is more than 6000 years old
5562859 he did not force gore to debate a crackpot from cloud cuckoo land who is still waiting for the evidence to arrive about human sources of radical climate change
5562860 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
5562861 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
5562862 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
5562863 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
5562864 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
5562865 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5562866 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
5562867 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
5562868 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
5562869 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
5562870 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
5562871 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5562872 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
5562873 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5562874 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head

5562876 i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
5562877 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
5562878 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
5562879 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
5562880 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
5562881 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
5562882 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
5562883 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
5562884 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
5562885 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
5562886 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
5562887 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians

5562889 hes a backside kind of guy his strengths are speed and his ability to work the strike zone he knows the strike zone
5562890 free us from our addiction to oil from 4 00 plus per gallon gas
5562891 there is no time to waste we want a better future we demand a better future we the american people are no longer asking
5562892 the free us ad takes a different tone than our previous efforts
5562893 this ad issues a direct and compelling challenge and juxtaposes the stark imagery of our addiction to fossil fuels with the earnest faces of the american people who are calling for answers and solutions now it takes the call for renewable energy from a request to a demand
5562894 the conventions are about coming together to choose the ideas and the people who will lead us forward
5562895 the next american president has the inescapable responsibility to move our country away from fossil fuels and toward clean sustainable energy sources our economic and environmental futures depend on it and the american people are demanding it
5562896 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5562897 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5562898 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5562899 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5562900 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5562901 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5562902 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5562903 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5562904 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5562905 if they would only let her into the debates and stand on the same stage with all the leaders people would be able to compare and see that for themselves
5562906 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5562907 we the citizens of the united states of america have the ultimate responsibility to elect the
5562908 people have been going there un office the process of submitting memorandum has been going on and people have never been stopped
5562909 necessary deployment of security forces was done and the whole thing passed off peacefully
5562910 the centre and the state are seized with the idea of evolving modalities
5562911 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5562912 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5562913 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5562914 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5562915 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5562916 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5562917 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5562918 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5562919 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5562920 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5562921 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5562922 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5562923 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5562924 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5562925 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5562926 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5562927 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5562928 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5562929 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5562930 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5562931 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5562932 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5562933 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5562934 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5562935 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5562936 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5562937 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5562938 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5562939 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5562940 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5562941 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5562942 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
5562943 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
5562944 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5562945 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
5562946 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5562947 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5562948 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5562949 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5562950 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5562951 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5562952 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5562953 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5562954 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5562955 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5562956 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5562957 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5562958 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5562959 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5562960 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5562961 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5562962 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5562963 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5562964 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5562965 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5562966 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5562967 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5562968 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5562969 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5562970 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5562971 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5562972 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
5562973 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
5562974 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
5562975 simply keeping a lid on 90210 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5562976 to ensure our national security economic prosperity and clean environment by breaking our dependence on foreign oil
5562977 the hands that install roofs can also install solar panels the hands that build todays cars can also build the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles barack obama will create 5 million jobs developing homegrown energy technologies
5562978 one of the most important ways of positioning on global warming is to emphasize the jobs issue since it appeals to people who you might not otherwise reach with your message
5562979 on the big issues that our nation faces some sacrifice will be required not only from you individually but from the nation as a whole there is no magic bullet to our energy problems for example no perfect energy source
5562980 the call to sacrifice for the nations greater good remains an imperative of citizenship sadly in recent years in the midst of a war on two fronts this call to service never came after 9 11 we were asked to shop
5562981 plenty of recent media polls demonstrate that drilling for more american oil particularly offshore drilling has the potential to be a very effective wedge issue for republicans as a way to reduce the price of gas
5562982 for the immediate short term right now forcing house democrats to vote on drilling offshore and in wilderness areas or exposing their refusal to hold this vote would be a potentially strong wedge issue that would split the democrats win among independents and excite the republicans
5562983 the republican echo chamber has done a great job on this
5562984 this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very future of our nation
5562985 the energy crisis is real it is worldwide it is a clear and present danger to our nation these are the facts and we must face them
5562986 thou shalt not talk honestly to the american people about sacrifice
5562987 who would have thought last year that me and t boone pickens would be in the same boat pulling the same oar the same way
5562988 when you go to the gas pump you dont check whether you are a democrat or republican
5562989 now dependent on foreign nations for 70 percent of its oil the u s is exporting 700 billion annually more than four times the cost of the iraq war
5562990 there are people standing by with billions ready to invest in the future sun wind geothermal biomass
5562991 we cant drill our way of this situation but we will do everything we can to produce more domestic energy just two years ago i pushed for 8 3 million acres of drill sites in the gulf of mexico now that is done
5562992 any credible domestic energy policy must reduce our dependence on foreign oil by at least 30 percent in the next 10 years
5562993 he understands the issues and is interested and excited by the work we are doing to educate and involve the people
5562994 importing 70 percent of our oil now thats an issue of security its going to take us 10 years to reduce our dependency by 30 percent
5562995 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
5562996 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
5562997 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
5562998 it may give more choice in the primary election but less choice in the general election and thats where we elect our leaders were not sure what the disease is but the cure is obviously worse than the disease
5562999 making up your mind questions to consider before the next election
5563000 heres what i want you to do between now and election
5563001 dont just look at issues look at character issues are important but you also have to look at character
5563002 theyre saying im totally self sufficient in myself and nobodys self sufficient enough to be president its too big a job
5563003 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5563004 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party
5563005 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich
5563006 even with that kind of income we struggle to pay everything we have gotten ourselves into
5563007 im pretty much a dyed in the wool republican and i was a marine what he went through for five years you gotta hand that to him
5563008 i mean come on whoever buys into that they gotta have a screw loose
5563009 just stay in the senate stay busy learn more foreign policy and come back in ten years obama and i betcha id vote for you
5563010 hes as genuine as can be its just hes a green apple hanging on the tree and mccain is a ripe red apple ready to be picked obama just needs to ripen some more
5563011 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got
5563012 thats christian identity politics and im sure it has some influence but i dont think at the end of the day its the deciding factor
5563013 jimmy carter could have come in here and sounded much more comfortable with his faith but people having seen a jimmy carter presidency would not vote for him just because theyre likely to see him in heaven
5563014 study all the different candidates at every different level you need to register to vote and then you need to vote
5563015 when i hear people say i dont like either of the candidates im just not going to vote i want to say to them well then you need to move to another country because people died for that vote
5563016 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5563017 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
5563018 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
5563019 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
5563020 hmmm we realize that someone cannot mention everything in one column so that these are selected things that professor clayson has learned i am sorry that he has chosen to publish such negative stuff since there is a lot more to learn
5563021 i would just like to mention that calling those holding an opposing view stupid is nothing new
5563022 mccain is still considered the republican candidate for president while edwards is not
5563023 i have heard over and over again about mccains affair what channel are you watching i think it is one of the only things the democrats have that and showing pics over and over of mccain with bush as if because he took a pic with him he is just like him
5563024 jeroze doyou read anything other than left wing talking points
5563025 the polls are tied yet i cant find anything reporting that bit of info here or on the national sites why
5563026 what does it matter if mccain had an affair its common knowledge that obama had an affair as well
5563027 today prof clayson denounces the press for its religious reverence to obama he then tries to prove it by providing three examples
5563028 the bat thinkaboutit and mister t have apparently been living on the moon for a while and have been out of touch with events here on earth the fact that john mccain was fooling around with cindy while he was still married to carol is something that he admits
5563029 jeroze you are right on mccains affair i did not see the entire saddle back event i was watching the swimming
5563030 cross you kill me every week i cant help but think you read a different article than me each week because your generalizations of claysons intent and meaning behind is writing seams to be much different than what i read
5563031 i dont get it the title says it all now liberals everywhere are trying to say clayson did not learn these things
5563032 cire asks what does it matter if mccain had an affair
5563033 cross is your goal to be insulting to people because if it is you are surely reaching your goals
5563034 sorry cire i wont take you seriously anymore and please dont take what i just wrote seriously
5563035 if you watched that youtube video and thought they were being serious im beyond concerned
5563036 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5563037 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5563038 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5563039 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5563040 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5563041 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
5563042 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5563043 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
5563044 if he made a decision to go or fight against it we didnt advise him either way
5563045 we really did keep our fingers out of this one
5563046 president musharraf has been a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5563047 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
5563048 the united states will help with these efforts to see pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable prosperous democratic modern muslim nation
5563049 there is a great deal of frustration on the part of the u s government with pakistans inability to follow through on what the u s sees as its clear commitments
5563050 it remains very much to be seen whether this new democratically elected leadership will really be able to follow through in a sustained and coherent way
5563051 it could actually be setting the torch to the kindling inside the country
5563052 i dont want the people of pakistan to slide deeper and deeper into uncertainty
5563053 it puts a lot more responsibility squarely on the government there is no more excuse any more they have to stand up and do things they cant blame musharraf
5563054 i really dont think he has been a factor for six months
5563055 he hasnt been able to do that while he was in the presidency and he wont be as well positioned out of the presidency to interfere
5563056 strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5563057 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face
5563058 but im too close to armagh and the players it would be very hard to take on another team to go out and meet your own but its one of the very biggest jobs in the game and i think anyone would be interested
5563059 and anyway the county board might want to appoint from the former management so im not going to speculate on it but im happy to take over a development team like the under 15s
5563060 i was very surprised because dublin were in such good form but i wasnt surprised that tyrone made such a great fight of it the match was an aberration in that dublin never played as badly i know a team only plays as well as its let but they seemed to get upset at the early setbacks alan brogans injury was a huge blow to confidence
5563061 theres no point in jumping over the moon if you cant put the ball over the bar almost every team is doing strength work but you have to peak maybe two or three times a season
5563062 its my particular hobby horse there are parts of the game that can only be learned by playing and cant be acquired simply through drills smart mentors are using small sided games as a way of prioritising tactical appreciation
5563063 i dont think kerry coach any more than we do but i think they play more and learn more from playing were getting young footballers to play to win kerry make sure theyre picking up the skill sets and decision making ability necessary to win matches later on
5563064 the difference is you know the next move in a drill you dont know the next move in a game or what an opponent is going to do next
5563065 at senior level the player is mostly a finished product and you can only make them tactically aware of the challenge that opponents will bring you should be working with senior players to give them the freedom to think
5563066 at least ive got dean kiely to give some stick to
5563067 i suppose the chance of playing in another world cup brought me back and when i met the manager i felt it was right
5563068 i had the summer to think about it i liked what i heard from the manager obviously hes got a lot of experience and the way he talked about certain things he just persuaded me to come back you always respect someone who has done well in management and no matter what age you are you can always learn from someone like that
5563069 i havent got a clue to be honest with you
5563070 ive not played many games recently theres a big squad there and everyone is fighting for their place if i can just train well ill take my chance if i get it ive spoken to rafa benitez about the situation but at this time i dont think ill say too much more you guys probably know more than me
5563071 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5563072 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5563073 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5563074 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5563075 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
5563076 we must pull together and support the candidate for president who is on our side barack obama this is at the core of what it means to be a member of our union
5563077 theres not a single good reason for any worker especially any union member to vote against barack obama
5563078 theres only one really bad reason to vote against him because hes not white
5563079 were going straight at our people and talking to them about the differences between mccain and obama and the fact that race could be an issue you go straight at it
5563080 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5563081 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5563082 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5563083 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability

5563087 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5563088 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5563089 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5563090 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5563091 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5563092 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
5563093 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5563094 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5563095 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5563096 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5563097 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5563098 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5563099 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5563100 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5563101 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5563102 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5563103 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5563104 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5563105 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5563106 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5563107 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5563108 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5563109 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5563110 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5563111 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5563112 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
5563113 but it would be the biggest mistake of his life if he goes on the mound hoping to show the rangers something thats high school stuff
5563114 cnn contacted me about this whole thing theyre doing for the election trying to encourage people to vote and they told us they were approaching chris for the project
5563115 im a big fan of his hes got a great voice and i thought it would be a really good idea so i just gave my blessing to the project and they took it from there
5563116 i think people have come to realize what a big mistake the last time theyd voted was it might have been anyway there are two very viable candidates as far as im concerned and there is one who will be a revolutionary candidate in a way and change the direction of america and i think the more people that get out there to vote thats extremely important
5563117 its a song that requires a really strong voice to carry it off and hes got the range and the power to really do it convincingly
5563118 i dont think there are that many singers around at the moment that could really nail it out of all the singers of that style hes the strongest hes just a great singer all around it doesnt matter what style it is he could pretty much sing anything
5563119 i think its not too far away from the original
5563120 theyve modernized it a bit brought it up to todays standards with the sound and arrangement too when i heard it it made me think back to when we recorded the original it was pretty exciting at the time and i sort of got the same feeling when i heard chris version
5563121 the reviews author takes issue with both the pacing of and the violence in the comic i wonder if hed believe that i take issue with both of those things too
5563122 hold on while i change out of this shirt that annoys adam so very much
5563123 the democrats talk of tolerance but in reality the only tolerance they ever exhibit is for their own intellectual arrogance and they dont have tolerance for my culture
5563124 they think were a bunch of hillbilly heathens who go out and burn crosses and do crazy bullshit
5563125 they dont give a f if were with them or not because it doesnt matter the f ing republicans have stolen the individual liberties thing and thats why the gun thing is such a big deal
5563126 i got a call from them right after johnny got out i never heard back
5563127 they have to be careful sometimes they remind me of another bunch from chicago the blues brothers they seem to think theyre on a mission from god
5563128 if thats how he runs his campaign he is going to lose id rather bet on those who voted before when he stands up and says that im gonna get 30 per cent more black voters im gonna get 30 per cent more of my people to turn out for me what is joe six pack thinking
5563129 he should say im a black guy im not gonna take the michael jackson treatment but the problems of south side chicago are the same problems of the appalachian mountains big sonsofabitches are kicking the little sonsofabitches in the ass now im one of the little sonsofabitches so im pissed off inside every rural republican is a rural democrat begging to get out but we always trip over our johnsons
5563130 think this election will be won on the internet but here at 5 30 in the afternoon they dont go on the goddamn internet they go watch the andy griffith show a 1960s sitcom
5563131 white people in the south and throughout the appalachians love black culture i mean southern style cooking is black food everything i eat is fried your swing vote in the appalachians comes down to common sense thinking people who have strong faith and what barack obama needs to do is embrace his culture because we like his culture but nobody knows anything about him over 10 per cent of the rednecks out here and im a redneck think hes a muslim cause nobodys ever told em any different
5563132 im pretty sure i aint a queer and ive never had queer thoughts
5563133 but god loves them queers every bit that he loves the republicans
5563134 its their mouth they can use it to haul coal if they want to
5563135 the gallant kids from around here who lost their lives
5563136 it is the same exact people its the same f ing bunch of fight sing drink pray people who are over there who are over here in these mountains
5563137 youre damn right theyre on hadrians side of the wall is where they are and they want the scots irish vote well its true its f ing genes its who we are as a people well say f you to bush longshanks or maggie thatcher f any of em
5563138 bitterly clinging to their religion guns and antithapy towards others
5563139 im here to advocate for sen obama that we get a democrat into the wh
5563140 reporters are grumbling more and more that the campaign is acting like the prom queen they gripe that it is arrogant and control ling and the campaigns own belief that obama is poised to make history isnt endearing either the press certainly helped obama get so far so fast the question is how far can he get if his campaign alienates them
5563141 end of the affair barack obama and the press break up
5563142 the problem is not that democrats are monolithically pro choice or anti school prayer its that by dropping the class language that once distinguished them sharply from republicans they have left themselves vulnerable to cultural wedge issues like guns and abortion and the rest whose hallucinatory appeal would ordinarily be overshadowed by material concerns we are in an environment where republicans talks constantly about class in a coded way to be sure but where democrats are afraid to bring it up
5563143 since i run a small computer repair business of my own i have a handful of guys working with me and i always stress to them that i want happy customers first through decent work and second by never making the customer feel stupid even if the customer made a mistake or did something stupid
5563144 although i like to think im practicing a little buddhist or socialist right livelihood here its also sound capitalism since happy customers not only come back they tell other people that your work was good and you treated them well and so they bring you more customers
5563145 we print critiques of obama all the time and dont have to go into your hyperbole
5563146 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5563147 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5563148 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5563149 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5563150 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5563151 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5563152 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5563153 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
5563154 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
5563155 since man lives by the permission of physical geography it is his fate to be divided by mountains rivers and seas into groups that develop in semi isolation their diverging languages and creeds their climatically conditioned features customs and dress

5563157 jabal sheard has had a tremendous camp he began camp as the backup to doug fulmer and doug tore his acl and is out for the season even if fulmer was healthy sheard would have won the starting defensive end spot all camp he has shown great speed strength and quickness he has made joe thomas look like a turn style at camp and has consistently pressured and sacked the qb paired with greg romeus pitt will have the best tandem of defense ends in the big east and both are poised for a break out season the coaches believe he has nfl ability and has to refine his skills a bit to become a high draft pick i would expect in 2008 he should post 5 10 sacks 10 20 tackles for loss and receive all big east consideration
5563158 there is great interest in growing your own food so you know whats in it or on it and avoid high prices at the grocery store
5563159 economists say canadian labour force drop shows job boom is over
5563160 55 200 canadian jobs disappeared in july the largest monthly drop since the early 1990s the unemployment rate actually shrank dropping a tenth of a point to 6 1 as an even larger number of people more than 74 000 of them dropped out of the labour force during the month
5563161 edged up by two ticks to 7 4 while in ontario the rate fell to 6 4 from 6 7 in june as 42 000 people left the labour market
5563162 mom was right you are a terrible worthless lazy father who doesnt care about us
5563163 i could have told you that you stupid damned kids
5563164 a gain of nearly 30 000 public sector positions partially offset the loss of 95 000 in the private sector
5563165 since july of 2007 employment in the public sector has grown by 6 1 compared with 0 5 for the private sector
5563166 do you really believe that present inflation is demand driven
5563167 that monetary policy is the root cause of the recent increase in the relative prices of energy and food
5563168 dismisses the critical non monetary factors including increasing commodity demand from strong capacity growth of the global economy coupled with short run supply constraints and various government distortions
5563169 then ask them hey how would you like a new car
5563170 and so you can also forget about capacity growth too because without the money to fuel the demand growth there aint no stinking capacity growth and thus there wont be any short run supply constraints although there will always be various government distortions
5563171 the film changed my life and my way of thinking i decided to do whatever i could
5563172 when i learned of their problem i decided to do something at least help them dig wells in their area which would provide a perennial source of water
5563173 when she expressed a desire to help people in rural maharashtra we decided to encourage her
5563174 she always had an inclination toward social service and we decided to cultivate it
5563175 the drive began in july and by the end of the month a total of 2600 was collected this money was sufficient to dig a bore well as well as fit an electric pump
5563176 i want to build rural maharashtra i want medical attention to be available to everyone and make physicians available in every village in rural maharashtra
5563177 o dia foi de estresse com o retorno das preocupa es sobre o setor financeiro norte americano alguns analistas acreditam que o federal reserve banco central dos eua ter que escolher entre a quebra do freddie mac e do fannie mae
5563178 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5563179 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5563180 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5563181 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5563182 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5563183 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5563184 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5563185 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5563186 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5563187 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5563188 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5563189 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5563190 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
5563191 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
5563192 same thing happened when i added some words to the universal pictures page but here it is
5563193 we are very pleased with the results to date and outlook of our two advanced stage projects donkin and zuun mod both from a market fundamental and feasibility standpoint
5563194 we view the third and fourth quarters of 2008 as a very exciting time for the growth of our company as we will see major milestone points for both projects a decision on initial underground development at donkin and pre feasibility for zuun mod as we advance these projects we will continue to move forward with other projects in our pipeline aligned with our commodity and regional focus
5563195 preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion
5563196 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5563197 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5563198 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5563199 i am sure that such a well conducted effective peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5563200 the world realized that even now there are political freaks who were ready to kill innocent people for the sake of political fashions and who compensated for their own stupidity by eliminating a whole nation
5563201 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5563202 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5563203 the situation is moving in a positive manner the tension is now being cooled down
5563204 the situation has improved quite a lot in regards to the standoff between the militaries from both sides
5563205 the tension around the area has been eased we hope very much that the situation will go back to normal as soon as possible
5563206 were going to stay in iraq to get the job done as long as the government wants us there
5563207 said his government was impatiently waiting for the complete withdrawal of u
5563208 redeploy combat brigades from iraq at a pace of 1 to 2 brigades a month that would remove them in 16 months
5563209 opposes the present us policy in iraq not on the basis of any principled opposition to neo colonialism or aggressive war but rather on the grounds that the iraq war is a mistaken deployment of power that fails to advance the global strategic interests of american imperialism
5563210 theres not that much difference between my position and george bushs position at this stage
5563211 nazis soviets in their gulags or some mad regime pol pot or others that had no concern for human beings
5563212 he would return the country to the more traditional foreign policy efforts of past presidents such as george h
5563213 these days an appreciable number of obama supporters are starting to use words like disillusionment but thats a consequence of projecting their political outlooks onto the candidate in the first place the best way to avoid becoming disillusioned is to not have illusions in the first place
5563214 the international tribunal for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former yugoslavia since 1991
5563215 wilful killing wilfully causing great suffering and serious injury to body and health employment of poisonous weapons and other weapons to cause unnecessary suffering wanton destruction of cities towns and villages unlawful attacks on civilian objects devastation not necessitated by military objectives attacks on undefended buildings and dwellings destruction and wilful damage done to institutions dedicated to religion charity and education the arts and sciences
5563216 not only a requirement of law it is a requirement of justice to the victims and of deterrence to powerful countries such as those in nato who in their military might and in their control over the media are lacking in any other natural restraint such as might deter less powerful countries
5563217 by holding individuals accountable regardless of their position the ictys work has dismantled the tradition of impunity for war crimes and other serious violations of international law particularly by individuals who held the most senior positions
5563218 it is a sad day when two people who spent only 36 months at the authority get to walk away with 300 000 after they are fired
5563219 theres other names up there that are just astounding some of our favorite artists and politicians
5563220 but its going to be really cool to see that in 10 years 20 years from now
5563221 a lot of kids feel lonely when they first get diagnosed with diabetes im just so encouraged at the end of the day because all im trying to do is make it through another day managing diabetes
5563222 theyre just doing the same thing were all there for each other
5563223 we run around onstage constantly for about an hour and 45 minutes and we know what that can do you just feel great at the end of the night and when you wake up in the morning
5563224 shines a harsh and frankly unflattering light on the attitudes we canadians have concerning mental health
5563225 its important that these data be out there and we discuss them
5563226 when i asked if you would marry me did you say yes or did you say no
5563227 why i said yes yes i will and i meant it with all my heart
5563228 and i am so glad that you called because i couldnt remember who had asked me
5563229 ive watched the storms a long time i love it
5563230 debris was flying through the air and busting up the windows
5563231 i brought all of my porch furniture in and what i couldnt bring in i tied down
5563232 be cautious dont underestimate the danger this is not a storm that should be deadly if we work together and just stay safe
5563233 this is not going to be as bad as charlie but i still dont want to take any chances
5563234 there is no doubt that the needs are there for 193 million plus
5563235 we need two or three times as much to get the things done that we need to get done
5563236 the direction i got from the board is they want us to put together some language that gives voters a choice when they go to the poles
5563237 and im proud to tell you chris in 24 years as a member of congress i have never asked for nor received a single earmark or pork barrel project for my state and i guarantee you ill veto those bills ill ask for the line item veto and ill veto them and ill make the authors of them famous
5563238 three complete ships of food were supposed to have arrived in port au prince on june no one has a clue what happened to the food it was not distributed
5563239 it gets really difficult when people are standing at the gate begging and you cannot expand the food program to include everybody because you dont know when the next food is coming in
5563240 they need gods guidance on how to deal with this because people cant hear the gospel message over a growling tummy but were in a situation where we cant feed all the tummies that are growling
5563241 together with the local evangelical church have started to do ministry in ossetia for the refugees
5563242 we dont care about whos right and whos wrong we only care about the more than 35 000 people theyre living with relatives they are in different schools a lot of them are in hospitals and a lot of them are in summer camps
5563243 they understand whats going on there because they experienced this several years earlier and we see it as very successful
5563244 christians dont care about what country you are from and they go and help it is unbelievable that local churches are gathering all the money they can to send humanitarian aid
5563245 first of all by praying about it pray about the evangelical churches pray about these people who are in need secondly if you can help help us so we can help them
5563246 i think this portrays the heart of the government they want an image that says that they have religious freedom but in all practice whenever you try to practice that religious freedom its not there
5563247 theyre just very difficult to find and they also are very very expensive so even though they say there are bibles in china they keep so few that an ordinary person cannot afford those bibles so many pastors in china are without bibles
5563248 is that god is glorified in all of this and that people learn that there is still persecution out there we need to stand in prayer for our brothers and sisters in china

5563259 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5563260 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5563261 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction
5563262 you know what to be honest i come to the ballpark i dont ask about joe crede

5563277 there is a very strong public interest in ensuring that australia invests in research and technology when it comes to cleaner coal options
5563278 the government recognises the reality of australias current energy mix if were going to tackle climate change we have to deal with the facts
5563279 we have to find a solution when it comes to coal fired power generation
5563280 we need to do that for australia we need to do that for the globe
5563281 that doesnt mean that you dont also invest in renewables
5563282 its hard not to live in the moment and for me at the moment i havent been able to get what i want out of footy
5563283 so at the moment im sort of frustrated i have been frustrated by what has happened this year
5563284 but my career as a whole has been really successful
5563285 i was waking up and not really looking forward to playing footy as i had in previous years and you just get the feeling it is time
5563286 no one wants to see the devastation i saw my friend and his family go through we have to lend our support to this campaign
5563287 you dont expect situations that are happening whereby people go to school in the morning and then you never see them again
5563288 we have got to help we have got a voice that kids listen to it is unfortunate it is part of life part of culture these days and this is why we want to get involved we want to make a change
5563289 in the past maybe there wasnt a strong enough deterrent for carrying knives
5563290 it is not always the person intending to hurt someone who gets injured people carrying the knives also get hurt
5563291 boredom can set in a lot of times there is a lot of peer pressure and then something happens that everyone regrets
5563292 young people need to understand that carrying a knife just like carrying a gun is dangerous and wrong
5563293 but government and the police cant solve this problem by themselves we need to change the way young people think about knives we need families and communities working together and we need influential role models
5563294 the players are well aware of the positive impact that they can have on those growing up

5563297 its a fight on a high level im in my element the sword is out i need to go into battle im more than motivated im all fired up
5563298 finally its time im impatient i want to find players to relaunch the machine
5563299 its a new departure with a rejuvenated squad and our objective is clear south africa and the world cup
5563300 its flattering of course to be compared to zidane but its a little bit annoying as well
5563301 its a lot of pressure on my shoulders and really hard to be compared to probably the best footballer of the last 10 years when you are a young player you dont tend to play well every week so it is a lot of pressure
5563302 bring the players together even for a short time to discover where we at without there being anything really at stake points wise it will allow us to sort things out
5563303 theres going to be a lot of service old i can tell you that
5563304 it was a difficult decision but i want to recover in time for the us open

5563319 having a flat year is not all in itself a bad thing when compared to building activity experienced in less stable building markets on the mainland and especially across the tasmania in new zealand
5563320 to build over 2800 homes consistently and to have a renovations market sitting around 750 million of activity show that broadly speaking the tasmanian industry has again been given a relatively stable prognosis
5563321 new dwelling starts are forecast to be down by 2 per cent in 2008 09
5563322 it is important that this trend is arrested in tasmania in light of stronger population growth and new lows in rental vacancies failure to do so will see the state follow the larger states into a much deeper housing affordability crisis
5563323 interest rate reductions will in time boost confidence and then construction activity but thats a 2009 10 story
5563324 we have a relatively inelastic supply side so no immediate bounce is expected and this is bad news particularly for those searching for affordable rental housing
5563325 we expect the recovery to be modest over 2009 10 and 2010 11 given the lack of skilled labour in the industry and the long road ahead in lifting housing affordability to reasonable levels

5563328 it is also perfect timing for the editorial boards to connect the dots between the failure of the florida office of financial regulation and the dominant political ideology of the past decade that abjured regulation in favor of the free market this may be easier to do now that real estate advertisement revenue from the growth machine has dried up
5563329 this friday floridas revenue estimating conference will convene to present their official budget forecast for the upcoming year and beyond prior to friday they believed floridas declining revenue might show a slight uptick prepare yourselves for more bad news as conditions have only worsened and their forecast is likely to reflect darker skies
5563330 mccains nasa stance went from downright schizophrenic to outright delusional yesterday with his campaign boasting of his influence on space policy in his former role as chairman of the u s senate committee on commerce science and transportation without mentioning that under mccains watch the impending five year gap between the retirement of the shuttle and the development of the next generation vehicle was created putting thousands of space coast jobs at risk

5563332 i cant say ive ever really been a fan of the press there are some really great reporters and columnists which still operate in the traditional press but i lament the sheer lack of coverage of state and local politics that has existed even before this latest round of layoffs the traditional press has been largely complicit and indeed an enabler in a lot of the failed politics and policies of the last quarter century
5563333 we the public dont have the full story on who knew what about the us sugar buyout offer that governor crist proposed one thing is for certain governor crist took an intractable problem an everglades restoration plan that cannot work and proposed a big step in the one direction that has the chance at some point in the future of helping the everglades
5563334 it is worth recalling that floridas current system of public finance is a house of cards built by pusillanimous pols owned and operated by the no taxes under any circumstances crowd a k a the chamber of commerce the associated industries of florida and other such denizens of the jeb s hole in the ground now with no backstop we floridians get exactly what jebbies patrons bought and paid for
5563335 julie kay examines the new trend of investigating jurors here
5563336 olivia judson makes as usual a compelling case for teaching evolution in the classroom it bothers me greatly that this is even an issue considering how poorly us students do on the world stage in math and science scores deliberately handicapping them by allowing nonsense like id and creationism in the public schools is criminal in my mind
5563337 could this be a subtle way for the fdp to prompt democratic voters into supporting the establishments chosen candidate it might as well have been there was no mistaking the intent behind this call i wasnt being asked whom i supported instead i was being led to accept the fdps suggestion
5563338 based on what we have been able to see of them they are the team to beat in our division
5563339 he did a great job and i didnt have to go out and talk to him because he knew it was all on his shoulders
5563340 he kept those batters off balance and i wish we could have gotten him more run support but maybe they are saving it for tomorrow
5563341 i thought they were kind of dragging a bit and were just trying to coast by this game for tomorrows big game
5563342 but if we win we will be in the drivers seat and my pitching is sitting pretty good tomorrow plus we will get a day off if we a win
5563343 he finally got his stroke and even though hes been hitting consistently he came up pretty big today
5563344 he twisted his ankle with the play at home and i decided to take him out at that point
5563345 they are a pretty solid team but i dont know if they have faced the type of pitching like they will see today with bergen
5563346 our defense is real confident behind brandon bergen just like it was today with william easter
5563347 the kids have been preparing for two years but its not like were at a crescendo now were tired of waiting and ready to go weve been talking about it so long now were ready to do it
5563348 between year one and two we had a night and day jump
5563349 the kids really improved and we have to have that same kind of improvement this season playing varsity in the toughest district in the state
5563350 we have a lot of athletes and were going to try to get a lot of people involved our passing game will open up our running game were going to try to get out to a fast start and put points on the scoreboard
5563351 he really can run and can throw the ball a mile he really is the total package and were going to need him to play at a very high level at an early age
5563352 the first day the first thing these kids heard from my mouth is that we are going to be big hitters and fly to the football
5563353 theres always room for one more in every tackle and thats where we want to be were going to take pride in being hitters
5563354 the key to us lining up in this storied district is to have the belief in ourselves that we can do it
5563355 i do and im sure the kids do too were the new kid on the block and we havent been there before and one it we just have to jump in there and do it
5563356 i go here every christmas eve with my parents what a cliche because this is some of the best chinese food in the city
5563357 make your way past the ice cream counter and rows of candy and cocktail mixers i love that they do little sandwich bags of a mixer and

5563369 i dont even know if i would recognize her anymore
5563370 we havent seen anything like this before where a company scores 10 points over its nearest rival
5563371 there was a question mark last year about apple that maybe it had taken its eye off the ball by concentrating on the iphone but now the iphone and ipod and mac are nicely aligned
5563372 most of apples windows based competition is suffering a bit from vista
5563373 complaints about vista are generating complaints about the computer makers
5563374 people know there have been some service and product quality problems but apple has an almost teflon like quality its problems dont really seem to matter to consumers
5563375 most lose it slowly like dell has which took a while and we see companies improve but apples extreme volatility is almost like its stock price
5563376 apple will be very difficult to catch but i dont think that these results where theres a 10 point difference will hold
5563377 my guess is that they will regroup at some point and come back
5563378 did i really pay that much and do i really need this
5563379 whoops should have been more clear about that rather than having 15 000 people wandering around downtown
5563380 hey kris i need directions the girls just got home and we want to go

5563420 the law minister farooq h naek said that the resignation of president musharraf would ensure the supremacy of the parliament and rule of law and democracy in the country he said it is the materialization of the sacrifices of ppp leader benazir bhutto and others who struggled for democracy about restoration of judiciary law minister said the coalition parties would decide the modalities about the reinstatement of the deposed judges
5563421 when musharraf imposed martial law on november 3 2007 he dismissed dozens of high court and supreme court judges and placed many of them under house arrest with their families he also detained hundreds of lawyers and other activists suspended fundamental rights protected in the pakistani constitution and placed restrictions on the media he replaced the deposed judges with handpicked loyalists who agreed to swear an oath of office under the provisional orders imposing martial law

5563634 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5563635 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5563636 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5563637 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5563638 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies

5563702 newspaper stocks have been decimated over the past year as the internet continues to steal readers and ad revenue from traditional print media we think the stocks have further room to fall as declining revenues and negative operating leverage combine to create a downward spiral for this moribund industry

5563715 it would be desirable if we could eliminate some preferences have a broader base of taxable income and lower the rates
5563716 higher rates give companies an incentive to shift their income to lower tax countries you would have less of that profit shifting going on if you could bring the rates into line with our trading partners

5563726 that refugee protection for military deserters and evaders is only available where the conduct objected to amounts to a war crime a crime against peace or a crime against humanity

5563755 obama made no big mistakes but his tendency to somewhat windy generalities meant he wasnt particularly compelling mccain who went second was crisp by contrast and his anecdotes colorful
5563756 mccain had the crowd on his side from the get go receiving applause for nearly every answer he offered the friendly crowd made him comfortable he repeatedly flashed his trademark wit and humor to keep the audience with him
5563757 senator obama was as usual calm dispassionate and verbally agile but mccain was more direct and passionate on issues that mattered to the crowd the performance at this debate cannot but help solidify mccains standing among evangelicals and attract some of the volunteers needed to counter obamas unprecedented ground game in many states
5563758 it is now clear why barack obama has refused john mccains offer of joint town hall appearances during the fall campaign mccain is obviously better at them

5563811 theres a very fine line because you can get into a groove of bad habits
5563812 and once bad habits get to rolling theyre like good habits they can continue if you dont pay attention to them
5563813 what we really need to do is focus on the details
5563814 thats what allows us to win games in the preseason and throughout the season thats how we function as a team by paying attention to the details you saw what happens when we dont missed tackles missed assignments guys not getting on blocks on special teams the offense i cant speak for them but im pretty sure they werent paying attention to the details either thats why we have to get back to the basics
5563815 i think you just have to keep doing the same kinds of things youve been doing

5563834 for one thing the kernel is quite complex and big and it inevitably simply takes time to learn all the rules not just for the code but for how the whole development environment works similarly for a new developer it will take time before people start recognising the name and start trusting the developer to do the right things
5563835 we make it fairly easy for people to ease into kernel development
5563836 it seems to be working too we literally have thousands of people with patches attributed to them in each release
5563837 the worst thing anybody can do is to study the kernel alone and try to learn things in private and then however many months later present all the established kernel developers with a big patch that just comes out of the blue
5563838 it may not sound exciting but quite frankly i dont think anybody who starts out believing that they want to rewrite some big piece of the kernel should even bother reality isnt that simple
5563839 of course some people will be alienated and theres no doubt that the process could probably be improved
5563840 not a warm and fuzzy environment where people sing kumbaya around the fireplace
5563841 the kernel is about pretty harsh technical issues and mistakes are really frowned upon
5563842 in an os kernel there are simply more security and stability requirements and the bar is really higher in some respects that will inevitably also reflect in the response to patches
5563843 i think that one of the things weve been very good at is to scale up with a good network of maintainers so that most people involved actually dont work closely with more than a handful of people
5563844 normally the people you find at the core of open source projects are professional software engineers these guys know how to run software projects

5563868 its sort of a wining proposition no matter how they do it the more content google provides the higher the likelihood that their customers will be more satisfied
5563869 all of the talk that yahoo and microsoft cannot do search on their own is not helping either of them in terms of a consumers perspective

5563925 hes the type of character that brands want to associate with because hes a genuinely nice guy who has overcome adversity
5563926 when is the next swim meet that you know of
5563927 hes going to have a quick hit and its going to be quite sizable in the tens of millions of dollars
5563928 but four weeks from now after he does the circuit with leno and all the late night people he may fade away a little bit
5563929 theres an old saying about gas prices they go up like rockets but come down like feathers
5563930 everyone is bringing down gas prices slowly because everyone has money to make back
5563931 the proposed height of 888 boylston street continues to violate the prudential centers master plan and i see no reason to vary from the plan
5563932 i dont think its going to surpass past sales tax holidays on average but overall id say we probably met the expectation of prior years
5563933 given everything the consumer and main street have been up against thats really a great thing because sales in general have not done well this summer
5563934 this was probably the busiest year ive seen so far minus the first year
5563935 with the economy the way it is right now people wanted to come out and save some money customers were excited
5563936 its good to see that even in some real challenging economic times consumers still feel good about going out and buying nice things

5563945 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5563946 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5563947 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5563948 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5563949 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5563950 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from mexico youd think we would want to pay more attention
5563951 between nehalem and nehalem desktop derivatives coming out next year and some of the nehalem server derivatives and larrabee and atom their plate is pretty full
5563952 the surprises may be if they are willing to talk more about performance
5563953 people are looking to consolidate four or five servers into one for high utilization
5563954 for this trend to take off they need to be able to put a high amount of ram into that server metaram lets them do that cost effectively

5563961 but while i beheld with pleasure the dawn of liberty rising in europe i saw with regret the lustre of it fading in america in less than two years from the time of my departure some distant symptoms painfully suggested the idea that the principles of the revolution were expiring on the soil that produced them
5563962 a faction acting in disguise was rising in america they had lost sight of first principles
5563963 they were beginning to contemplate government as a profitable monopoly and the people as hereditary property
5563964 i want to tell you something very clear dont worry about american pressure on israel we the jewish people control america and the americans know it

5564006 i failed in the pollard affair just as i failed in other intelligence operations beyond enemy lines
5564007 that is the lot of an intelligence officer who runs complex intelligence operations when you work a lot and do a lot especially in the intelligence field you win some and you lose some
5564008 nobody knows either about your successes or your failures it doesnt cause a fuss but this was a big fuss you take such a possibility into consideration but there is nothing you can do about it

5564035 it staggers me to think that there are many who now associate freedom with the normalization of everything formerly regarded as morally repugnant when the truth is were building a world in which the majority will be slaves to every whim and fancy not to mention dark and abhorrent desire the human imagination can conceive thats a form of freedom i can well do without

5564039 christianity is essentially preoccupied with the individual salvation of man judaism only contemplates the salvation of the house of israel which alone can permit the salvation of seventy nations of the universe
5564040 the advent of christ was a national catastrophe for the jewish people especially for the leaders
5564041 until then they alone had been the sons of the covenant they had been its sole high priests and beneficiaries

5564100 hope you are not upset after that plagiarism deal you went through last winter this really is not like that you know
5564101 no dear this is not the same that other was personal it was an invasion of privacy and i was very offended by it but time heals all wounds and it is all in the past hopefully never to return again lets change the subject
5564102 look i know this looks bad but after i went to those sites to see my poetry and pursued the matter i met this guy he really was not all that bad he said he traded with some others and ended up with things he should have left alone and he never dreamed he would get caught once he did he decided to never do something so foolish again and he hasnt anyway we just became online friends
5564103 fine mom and how many of those other guys did you meet over on those sites i know what the sites are you showed them to me when you were so upset about all that went on there are a dozen guys that show up over and over on your e mail and how is it you know so many guys named tyrone
5564104 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases

5564106 we get paid over 550 a month counting your employers contributions but youve still gotta meet that deductible or you can just pay us even more and have a lower deductible so you can meet it
5564107 oh yes this is going to be so wonderful what a thrill but the people demand that the government take care of them and the politicians are only thrilled to respond if it means they can keep their precious positions of power three stories came our way in just the last two days the first was of a woman in britain who was diagnosed with a small melanoma skin cancer just a small spot problem was it took her a few months to see a specialist to get it removed by then it had spread and now shes going through the chemotherapy thing may not survive my own experience in this country you know the country with the hideous health care system was somewhat different the lady what cuts my hair told me she saw a spot on my noggin that she didnt like within one hour i was being looked at by a specialist but then again we dont have that wonderful national health care scheme they have in the uk then there a story i saw last night on fox news this time it is canada you know how much liberals love to brag about canada preliminary tests show that this young teenage girl has a budding tumor in her brain shes now waiting for an mri cant get an appointment for five weeks then after the mri it is going to take another four to five months to get an appointment with a specialist to read the mri an recommend a course of action in the meantime this girl is suffering blackouts and cannot go to school we just dont know what were missing down here without this wonderful canadian health care system looking over us back to the uk another woman diagnosed with cancer her problem isnt a wait her problem is that she just flat cant get the operation theyre telling her that at 61 shes just too old the health care services she seeks will be better spent on someone with longer to live but you folks pay no attention to these stories rationing wont happen here there will be no months long wait to have melanoma removed youll be able to get an mri within hours or at least by the next day if needed after all this is the u s government were talking about a model of efficiency our national health care is just going to be paradise on earth if you dont believe me you just go check out the emergency room of your local charity hospital look at all of the people there waiting to be treated for something that a spoonful of cough medicine or a squirt of neosporin could cure that ought to convince you

5564109 in one fordham university study 122 students in fifth sixth and seventh grades were asked to think out loud for 20 minutes while playing a game they had never seen before researchers studied the childrens statements to see if playing the game improved cognitive and perceptual skills
5564110 the younger kids are focusing more on their planning and problem solving while they are actually playing the game while adolescents are focusing less on their planning and strategizing and more on the here and now
5564111 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed
5564112 so the first question you might ask your surgeon is how many of these surgeries have you done and the second question is are you a gamer
5564113 the vast majority of the discussion participants 86 percent shared knowledge to solve problems and more than half 58 percent used systematic and evaluative processes researchers found
5564114 other studies confirmed earlier research that found students who played violent games tended to be more hostile less forgiving and believed violence to be normal compared to those who played nonviolent games and those who played more entertainment games did poorer in school and were are greater risk of obesity

5564138 my first thought was this is ridiculous that we cant collect our own rain water
5564139 because the rain water is the water supply that the state has
5564140 we shouldnt punish someone for doing what we feel is the right thing to do
5564141 because that doesnt make sense either if youre going to have a law enforce the law
5564142 thats the idea of the water rights system is to protect the people who put water to use and who want to put water to use they ought to have some certainty about what to expect from everyone else

5564146 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5564147 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5564148 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5564149 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5564150 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5564151 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5564152 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5564153 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5564154 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5564155 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5564156 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5564157 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5564158 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5564159 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

5564200 keluarga keluarga di indonesia banyak yang ngga paham tentang buku mereka tahu buku itu hanya buku pelajaran bukan judulnya apa pengarangnya siapa atau ceritanya bagus apa ngga betapa tidak adanya sosialisasi tentang buku dan membaca di institusi pendidikan di indonesia
5564201 namun jangan disamakan dengan gerakan pemerintah yang sporadis kita sifatnya lebih ke merespon saja yang sudah ada di masyarakat
5564202 dari sebuah kondisi yang mereka tidak tahu buku itu apa lalu muncul figuritas yang kemudian membuat mereka mau mencari tahu apa itu buku
5564203 jadi ngga juga sembarangan di satu daerah kita hajar buat komunitas baca atau apa
5564204 macam macam responnya misal nih untuk kasus ibu yang di lembang itu setelah kita jelaskan tentang program anak buku gratis dan komunitas yang ada ibu itu malah justru lebih tertarik menonton sinetron
5564205 makanya kita biasanya dekati anak muda nya di satu daerah nah kalo anak anak mudanya udah kepegang nanti dia yang masuk ke kalangan tua maupun ke anak anak di bawahnya
5564206 warga setempat banyak kita libatkan sebagai penyelenggara jadi mereka memiliki kepemilikan terhadap program maupun komunitas yang terbentuk jadi bukan seperti gerakan pemerintah yang kebanyakan masyarakat hanya memanfaatkan saja yang sudah ada
5564207 misal kita lihat para sopir angkot atau becak di waktu waktu senggangnya membaca koran kenapa koran karena harganya murah dan aksesnya mudah jika ada bacaan yang lain mereka juga mungkin akan membacanya
5564208 misal seperti komunitas mabulir majalah buku bergilir yang digagas mbah dauzan farouk alm di jogja red semenjak ada komunitas itu setiap habis magrib bapa bapa pada datang untuk membaca buku
5564209 itu terjadi di komunitas masyarakat labuhan banten saya lupa nama desanya
5564210 aparat desa itu meninggalkan saya begitu saja padahal sebelumnya sudah ada janji untuk mengadakan pertemuan
5564211 jangan mengekslusifkan diri sebagai penolong sinterklas atau apa tapi jangan juga jadi pelayan itu tadi libatkan mereka sebagai penyelenggara
5564212 ini biasanya karena ada sosok figuritas yang kemudian meninggalkan tempat tersebut
5564213 tapi kadang kadang setelah satu mati suka muncul gantinya ini terjadi di bogor pernah ada bogor membaca yang kemudian mati tak lama muncul komunitas serupa yang kemudian mengusung nama bogor membaca pula

5564225 hes treating it just like he would during a normal game week and the push to saturday
5564226 if i felt stiff its because i was standing around too much the last couple days
5564227 today was certainly more action than hes gotten and the plan is to get him in saturday
5564228 i think ive just continued to get better in the preseason in the games and in practice so this will be another step to take
5564229 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5564230 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have i feel good about kyle leading our team
5564231 completions turnovers to just the feeling we have on who can manage the game the best for us all of things like that
5564232 and the good thing about evaluating both rex and kyle weve had a long time to do it its been quite a few years weve had a chance to see both guys play
5564233 multiple assault type weapons were found various handguns altered firearms and unlawful possession firearms ammunition for those weapons homemade incendiary devices and military type incendiary devices
5564234 were finally able to get an apples to apples comparison
5564235 is to take those first time riders that are right now finding us and keep them riding we hope theyll see how much of a bargain it is to ride versus paying extra money at the pump and paying to park downtown
5564236 when i first started riding i had no problem finding a seat now i do you get used to seeing the same faces but a lot of them are different
5564237 i can walk to my stop its a combination of gas prices and the convenience i mean it feels like an even easier commute than it is
5564238 ive noticed that there seem to be more riders lately and my sister who rides in the mornings said shes really noticed it then
5564239 my husband and i share one vehicle and its so much easier to do it this way
5564240 the parking my gosh and the wear and tear on your car and the cost of gas nowadays taking the t may seem like a little bit of an inconvenience but its so much more cost effective
5564241 its still a good value as opposed to paying to park
5564242 i suppose increased ridership is good but we dont need really any more riders
5564243 i cant get a seat as it is by the time i get on it around 5 oclock its standing room only
5564244 the family and i believe another side of this story has to be told
5564245 at this point we are not saying he died of positional asphyxia or anything else because we dont have all the information
5564246 no evidence of internal injury to any vital organ that can explain the death
5564247 to indicate that there was no violence that night is inaccurate
5564248 ive been in practice 37 years and the only time i hear excited delirium used is when its in connection with a taser death
5564249 we are dismayed by the cavalier continuation of business as usual by the swissvale police
5564250 when police immobilize a person they must be held responsible for that persons safety too many innocent people like mr thomas have died
5564251 theres a lot i can ask its not bringing him back to me
5564252 were hoping that this book will help them through some of the things they have to go through to get closure
5564253 its a traumatic event when someone gets injured and then they have to figure out how to get their questions answered
5564254 this sets up a whole program to make it easier for them to deal with all the things they have to deal with in the investigation
5564255 he died in 1956 and i was only born in 1950
5564256 in using senate funds and the large staff he was provided fumo observed no distinction whatsoever between public and private tasks
5564257 i was hired as a legislative aide and was given the task of project manager for fumos house
5564258 im pretty excited because of the opportunity to do stuff weve wanted to do for some time now that in and of itself is cool
5564259 youre just not going to go shopping when you got three kids with you
5564260 its really an event if we can capture some revenue off it terrific
5564261 it really is a true regional event that brings people downtown to celebrate the coming holidays
5564262 an error in judgment involving the approval of excessive transfer credits and excessive units for independent study in lieu of course work
5564263 we always take any issue regarding academic integrity very seriously
5564264 this is something where when we find out something like this we review it immediately
5564265 was brought to a faculty members attention earlier this year
5564266 im surprised because they are pretty meticulous about the rules and policies it would be useful to know exactly what happened
5564267 you cant help but make parallels between this and wvu
5564268 im very impressed by how they seem to be dealing with this nipping it in the bud
5564269 you dont treat someone who has been loyal to you given you this much of his life blood sweat and tears in such a publicly demeaning way
5564270 when somebody resigns you let them resign you dont do it in a public forum like this
5564271 this happened very quickly and i believe that the situation at wvu in which there was a diploma awarded outside the rules weighed heavily on the cmu administration
5564272 the preseason is important but i think the idea is to be ready for when the regular season kicks off
5564273 im doing good doing good just wishing i could have been out there last night
5564274 ill try to get treatment this week im feeling better every day
5564275 training camp is very physically demanding theres some things that come up whether it be a foot or an arm
5564276 its just trying to be smart trying to understand its a long season and not going out there and aggravating something
5564277 this is a big challenge for us a lot of people have tried and failed
5564278 i think the expectation in the community is that until we have the higher end destination retail there isnt any reason to shop downtown so we have to do it
5564279 saks fifth avenues departure would make the opportunity to attract similar retailers even less compelling
5564280 indeed one has to wonder whether the ubiquitous brands already in the golden triangle talbots ann taylor joseph a bank clothiers and bailey banks amp biddle would remain if the upscale anchor were to leave
5564281 if we can work to put something together with a property owner and a retailer and take it to them we think they would be receptive to that
5564282 cranes are dotting pittsburghs skyline downtown living is on the rise and in historic market square business is booming we must build upon this momentum working together to improve pittsburghs retail environment
5564283 how are we supposed to get this thing out of here
5564284 i just want to get my hands on the controls

5564286 its different when youre running and dont know what youre doing

5564288 i just go do what the coaches say when they put me in
5564289 i just try to do my job when you have a year under your belt youre feeling a lot better i just went out and made plays that came to me
5564290 the atmosphere was to be such that a man in a coat and tie would feel as comfortable as a student
5564291 what was needed was a building that would reflect the plaza like nature of the downtown area

5564295 i think this is really about tapping into both online and offline
5564296 i think thats also a big part of what marketers want to do
5564297 they absolutely want to protect that tv audience but youve got to give them credit because they are streaming a ton of stuff online

5564303 but like so many ex drug addicts i just switched from drugs to alcohol and then i became an alcoholic

5564312 i didnt know you love your grandchildren more than you love your original children
5564313 once i had a grandbaby i had to stick around see how this turns out
5564314 in my situation everything that could go right did i was out of the hospital in eight days and back to playing basketball in two months

5564394 breastfeeding has a mommy effect on me i was just visualizing breastfeeding my babygirl in months to come
5564395 let me rephrase my question do you believe god is a holy god
5564396 do you believe that there is an eternal penalty for sin
5564397 good do you believe that jesus christ paid the sin penalty for every human being
5564398 because god created us all and he wants to save us all everybody does not know about jesus everybody will go to heaven if they are good
5564399 thats the issue where did you get that information from
5564400 thats fine well lets focus on you and leave everybody else out for a brief moment since you believe that jesus paid the sin penalty for you would you receive his gift
5564401 you dont have to all i want you to do is decide whether you believe in your heart that jesus paid the price for your sin whether jesus rose from the dead and whether youre willing to make jesus the lord of your life
5564402 according to gods word in romans 10 9 10 i believe in my heart that god raised jesus from the dead and confess with my mouth that jesus is my lord and savior therefore i am saved
5564403 thank you thank you all tay is going to be so happy he got saved two months after we married and has been on me to do this i just didnt want to be a fanatic

5564409 there was a need to increase awareness in the sport optics binoculars area
5564410 we dont have the resources to make the same level of presence at the dealers counters as our competitors do
5564411 its important for us to help the consumer be more aware so that they ask about our products when they are at the counter or online and secondly that they ask the dealers to consider stocking us
5564412 we drove traffic to the site through publicity news releases a wire story and word of mouth circulating from the dealers
5564413 it brings the best of the in store experience to the online model its the next best thing to being there and in some ways its actually better than being there
5564414 you can learn more by watching the video than most typical people at a store can tell you about a product
5564415 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
5564416 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
5564417 for decades we were told that deet warded off mosquito bites because it blocked insect response to lactic acid from the host the key stimulus for blood feeding
5564418 dr leal and co workers escaped the key stimulus over simplification to show that mosquito responses like our own result from a balancing of various positive and negative factors all impinging on a tiny brain more capable than most people think of sophisticated decision making
5564419 one of the great attributes of science is that over time it is self correcting
5564420 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound
5564421 i couldnt believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom so i repeated the experiment over and over until we discussed the findings in the lab
5564422 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellent relatively little is known about how it actually works
5564423 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellents are compared
5564424 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
5564425 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognizing and representing numerosities the number of objects in a set and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks that do not require number words
5564426 in our tasks we couldnt for example ask questions such as
5564427 do these two sets have the same number of objects
5564428 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
5564429 the take home lesson is that platelets by releasing pf4 are playing an early role in the wind up phase of cerebral malaria
5564430 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them a big challenge in translating this to humans is that people dont know when they get infected
5564431 the 3d body scanner accurately extracts hundreds of measurements of the human body including volume in six seconds and removes a potential source of measurement error the human experimenter
5564432 it is widely believed that human beings are attracted to one another as a result of genotypic and phenotypic quality in other words their prospect as a mate who will yield higher quality offspring for the chooser
5564433 my previous research suggested that bodily symmetry is not necessarily what people attend to when they find someone attractive but nonetheless the physical cues that they do prefer may reveal an individuals underlying developmental quality i e degree of symmetry this new research identifies an explanation for the correlation between bodily shape and attractiveness your body proportions shape and stature are signals that conspicuously advertise your good development or health and therefore the degree to which you are a desirable reproductive partner in many species fewer departures from perfect symmetry are associated with good development health and reproductive success

5564437 nature has developed all of this firepower for getting things into cells and one of the ways is to create entities that are arginine rich
5564438 arginine rich sequences appear to figure in the mechanisms by which many pathogens invade cells
5564439 its an exciting result to be able to take a drug known to work against cancer but stymied by resistant cells and restore it to effectiveness using an arginine transporter
5564440 this bodes well for use with other drugs that succumb to resistance
5564441 in essence the technology can be used to overcome one of the most challenging types of problems of drug resistance
5564442 if youre not recognized as being part of the club then youre kicked out
5564443 if we think of the pump as being a bouncer for the cellular club then effectively what were doing is disguising one of these therapeutic agents to get it in through the back door or the side door
5564444 this could potentially be used with any drug which is effective but has a delivery problem
5564445 as the transporter with all these arginine guanidinium groups approaches the cell it basically does a handshake using hydrogen bonds with cell surface constituents that are in the membrane
5564446 in essence it changes its physical properties by shaking hands with all these cell membrane components
5564447 ovarian cancer has a drug taxol that works pretty well in the beginning seventy or eighty percent of the patients have a response
5564448 but it fails at the end because drug resistance develops

5564460 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5564461 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5564462 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction

5564501 we are very pleased with our overall results during the first half of 2008 as strong revenue growth and improving expense margins highlight the success of our strategy to leverage discount ticketing with our merchandising and entertainment businesses
5564502 we have successfully built an entertainment platform that has us positioned for long term profitable growth both organically and through additional strategic acquisitions
5564503 our ticketing service segment improved its operating income by over 22 to 1 4 million for the second quarter of 2008 this was offset by an operating loss in our exhibit merchandising and live entertainment segments due to the seasonal slow down of touring shows and the slower consumer environment and lower attendance at the exhibits in europe we anticipate stronger profitability in the third and fourth quarters of 2008
5564504 in a very short period of time we have built a leading entertainment platform through our three strategic and complementary divisions of tix4tonight exhibit merchandising and tix productions we are excited about our long term growth opportunities in this multi tiered industry and look forward to improving our operating results in the second half of 2008

5564510 when people work in the neighborhood where they live they treat the neighborhood with a higher level of respect because they personally know the families and the children who will be affected
5564511 we are all want to see improvements in our neighborhood
5564512 but when we are treated in such a hostile manner it sends the message loud and clear that we are not wanted here
5564513 its been particularly pleasing to gather nominations from across all parts of the country and across all sections of the party however its obviously a very tight race and in the end it will be votes and not nominations that win this election

5564517 the opposition is not afraid of losing against gloria macapagal arroyo in 2010 if the constitution were amended and she could run again if the administration is really brave then let them make a strong push to amend the charter specifically to allow arroyo to run again and let us see if the people will support arroyo or reject her like before
5564518 would change the balance of relations between china and taiwan and thats of concern
5564519 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists

5564521 you have the green party which was carved out of the flesh of the spd and the left party which also took its share of the spd

5564572 regaining the momentum we had really shouldnt be a problem for us the car was undamaged after watkins glen and the turnaround was done in short order the hardest part is yet to come we have to come out of california undamaged and be in new jersey in four days we had to hire an additional truck driver just to make it happen legally this part of the schedule is really not the best coast to coast in four days and two races is insane the guys had a long weekend and a couple of days off but they will be putting in some long hours during the next week and half
5564573 since i have familiarity with the track it gives me added confidence going to race here unlike a lot of tracks that ive competed on this year i already know which way the turns go and have an appreciation for the elevation changes and the tracks rhythm im looking forward to coming back to this track that served as a cornerstone for my driving career i intend to leave it having gained renewed fondness for the track
5564574 i havent driven on the track in over 15 years but i venture to guess that i will find it as technically challenging as it was in the past when it was sears point it was a track that demanded a good setup with a premium on mechanical grip my expectation is that my experience racing there will be similar to that of laguna seca whereby i found the turns came up a whole lot faster than i remember them from before
5564575 i have fond regard for the track it happens to be the track where i got my first race win in 1985 driving an scca gt 3 mazda rx 3 what made it especially memorable was that i won the race on mothers day and my mother was with me when i won ill never forget giving her a ride on my victory lap with her waving the checkered flag sears point was also the site of my first professional race in 1989 during an imsa gto event fortunately i dont have any bad memories here
5564576 one of the main reasons i like racing at infineon is that is has real character even with all the changes the track has gone through it still remained a drivers track you have to have a good car but you also need to be on top of your game as a driver we get to race some of the original configuration the nascar and irl boys just dont know what they are missing
5564577 for me its actually a good thing to race this much i keep sharp by driving and racing week in and week out i did the koni race in trois rivieres since the dp race so for me i am in driving heaven the truck driver and the crew are the ones working the hardest fortunately we left montreal and then the glen with the car in really good shape no major things to repair i am sure the crew as well as steve and martha are extremely happy about that
5564578 i dont think well have any problem regaining our momentum at all our performance at the glen could have easily gone the other way we were just on the wrong tire at the wrong time leading laps at the races prior to the glen is still with us and still keeps us motivated
5564579 the best synth site on the web always updated always interesting
5564580 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated

5564584 using the one tool that it has always used when it wished to deliver a message
5564585 i dont expect that we will nor have we sought to accelerate map for georgia
5564586 i think the very fact of the alliance meeting and considering what steps it will take to assist georgia will send a very clear message

5564593 this barrier will give us the ability in the event of special events and accidents to be able to create additional capacity when we need more lanes in whichever direction

5564603 he has beat the horse of corrupt l a cops to a bloody pulp that horse was still wheezing a little so he decided to finish the job with street kings
5564604 the most terrible crime ever committed in the state of indiana
5564605 the scenes of abuse in an american crime are extremely tasteful but still very disturbing
5564606 if the film would realize that its power lies within the idea of inner evils and not lose time with other drama conventions like the confrontational scene at the end or the escape sequences it wouldve been remarkable
5564607 what makes the story and therefore the movie so uniquely disturbing and horrifying is not the psychopathic mother lets face facts we have many psychopaths today and many slasher movies to match them nor the specific details of the torture she implemented but the fact that everybody else went along with it

5564613 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5564614 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5564615 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5564616 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5564617 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5564618 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5564619 with five blokes to every girl may i suggest that beauty disadvantaged women should proceed to mount isa
5564620 those women would have a better chance there of finding a partner than they would in other places
5564621 it would naturally seem that there may well be less competition
5564622 its a public attack on women and a form of verbal and emotional abuse

5564624 the love in love marriages starts out high and decreases very substantially after a year and a half or two years
5564625 but in arranged marriages it starts at zero and gradually increases it surpasses the love in love marriages at around the five year mark
5564626 but if youre in a room full of people youre working with every day then over time other kinds of interactions take place which allow the superficial characteristics to fall away
5564627 so in other words you can become psychologically intimate with somebody just because of proximity and repeated interactions
5564628 with the way she looks and the way he sees its a perfect match

5564633 that refugee protection for military deserters and evaders is only available where the conduct objected to amounts to a war crime a crime against peace or a crime against humanity
5564634 officially condoned military misconduct falling well short of a war crime may a support a claim to refugee protection
5564635 i believe in a canada that grants asylum to principled young americans that said no to an illegal war
5564636 our tradition of welcoming those who are essentially political refugees goes back to the united empire loyalists
5564637 harpers mean spirited decision to allow this deportation is sad
5564638 jeremy has called canada his home for the past five years and has just recently celebrated the birth of his second child if there was ever a case to grant refugee status on compassionate and humanitarian grounds this is it
5564639 ordinary canadians have already said yes to jeremy hinzman and to his family
5564640 they have spoken through their parliament they want to let mr hinzman and other u s iraq war resisters stay in canada
5564641 supporters are calling on hon diane finley minister of citizenship and immigration to intervene phone 613 996 4974 or email

5564651 we are delighted that olympics athletes took the opportunity to download this unique album which conveys a message of hope and solidarity with the tibetan people as well as a commitment to freedom of expression that cannot be suppressed
5564652 are rallying together to denounce internet retailers that offer songs for tibet for purchase
5564653 the predictably hostile response to the album from chinese internet users and an official website at this time reflects continued attempts to suppress any support for tibet at a time of crisis for the tibetan people as well as the level of entrenched misinformation about tibet propagated by the beijing government among the chinese public

5564659 but im nervous you know its natalie wood ive seen all her movies
5564660 running through rice fields jumping out of trains and having a pretty good time all by myself
5564661 they even wanted to do a sequel which i thought was nuts i mean didnt they see the ending of the original
5564662 we hear a lot about indians from robert redford yet here he is at the end of the film giving an indian the finger
5564663 its a great movie they said thank you we said theres really nothing like it they said well yeah thanks we said and thats the problem they said we dont know how to sell it
5564664 they had to come over to cannes and pretend they loved it
5564665 statements i wanted to make as a citizen statements about how i saw my country
5564666 westerns are out or indians are out and so on i think thats nonsense westerns are so much part of our history and culture theyll always be there
5564667 somewhere in the middle is where it should be but i love westerns and will always like to make them
5564668 being able to do my own hitting and pitching was pretty exciting
5564669 mr redford in all the presidents men you played a crusading journalist struggling to report the truth given that your publicist has restricted the presss ability to give a full and proper account of tonights event here in dublin will you ever be able to look bob woodward in the eye again
5564670 and tell him from me he can deep throat my dictaphone
5564671 i thought it was gone even with the wind blowing in
5564672 hes an icon here in china he has a very bright future
5564673 if anybody takes a hit from it its certainly nike simply because theyre all about performance whereas the others are about brand image
5564674 nikes all about you dont win silver you lose gold with that attitude its much tougher for them because he was certainly the cornerstone for their program
5564675 whenever he goes out he sees his own picture in the streets
5564676 we will continue to count on liu xiang as an ambassador for our company and our brand because his achievements both on and off the field will continue to inspire fans and consumers throughout china
5564677 its about picking yourself up when youre down and coming back stronger
5564678 i felt comfortable i just wanted to win the heat with as little effort as possible and just not take any chances

5564682 i feel pretty good i think everybody is a little sluggish it was just one of those days
5564683 im glad i finally got that first race out of the way
5564684 it wasnt as bad as i dreamed it would be i got out there and it was just like any other meet just dont look at the third level of the stadium seating
5564685 i came out with as little effort as possible i felt comfortable i just wanted to win the heat with as little effort as possible and just not take any chances
5564686 i like to see where im at why she looks at the screen and not slow down too much

5564696 a pior coisa que o mundo poderia fazer seria se comprometer e mostrar fraqueza
5564697 we wanted to make this movie part of the national conversation before the election
5564698 we are actually showing the film at both the democratic and republican conventions after the premiere
5564699 we are hoping that the presidential candidates will take up these issues and take a leadership position in helping to resolve them and lead a conversation about them which is not happening now
5564700 its economics and it seems like a difficult subject to understand
5564701 but we have succeeded in making it a fun and entertaining movie we convey an important message but at the same time its not so heavy people cant understand it
5564702 we intentionally didnt want to make it like inconvenient truth or any michael moore film
5564703 we wanted to make this entertaining but also convey the important message of the crisis we face
5564704 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power
5564705 thats not the way to deal in the 21st century
5564706 weve had russian strategic aviation challenging in ways they havent even along our borders with the united states which i might note is a very dangerous game and perhaps one that i suggest the russians want to reconsider this is not one that is cost free
5564707 that is an objective that will be denied because georgian democracy stands and it will stand with the help of its allies around the world
5564708 georgian infrastructure will be rebuilt georgias economy will be reinforced
5564709 we are going to send a message that we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures like georgia and ukraine
5564710 frankly russia cant have it both ways it cant act in a way that it did in the cold war when it was the soviet union and expect to be treated as a responsible partner
5564711 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power

5564718 everybody in this room could be donating to some other cause or to their own well being but i want to thank you
5564719 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fundraiser with one of jack abramoffs closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program but voters deserve to know the answers to the real questions raised by reeds involvement
5564720 if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all
5564721 before the obama campaign launches attacks they should stop and think about the amount of money that has been raised through convicted criminal and longtime fundraiser tony rezko
5564722 it takes a lot of audacity for obama and his spokespeople to criticize john mccain when obama was involved in a questionable home purchase with rezkos wife and years of friendship and dealings with a man convicted of wire and mail fraud money laundering and aiding and abetting bribery

5564730 hemos probado un par de nuevos neum ticos delanteros que michelin trajo para los test pero hemos terminado con ellos tras s lo unas pocas vueltas porque no hemos encontrado mejora alguna

5564732 hay que estar contentos el equipo ha jugado bien y ha tenido ocasiones
5564733 espero un partido dif cil porque ellos en casa siempre salen a ganar y adem s tienen que marcar pero nosotros estamos muy bien y va a ser un partido muy igualado y complicado pero muy bonito

5564744 los goles se marcan cuando estas al 120 por ciento y ahora trabajo mucho f sicamente y falta ese poquito de chispa que tienes cuando la semana de trabajo es normal
5564745 refuerzan a la gente y hace pensar que est s trabajando bien
5564746 por ello es bueno no perder pero a pesar de ello estamos contentos de lo que hemos trabajado esta semana y aunque no ha habido una buena imagen nos quedamos con el trabajo realizado
5564747 tiene problemas con la mitad de equipos de la liga espa ola
5564748 debemos aprender y saber que esto puede pasar en un partido de liga
5564749 aportaron mucho para el subcampeonato y es l gico que haya ganas de que vuelvan
5564750 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5564751 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5564752 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5564753 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5564754 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5564755 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5564756 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5564757 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5564758 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5564759 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
5564760 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
5564761 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
5564762 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
5564763 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
5564764 it cant be described well never ever see it again
5564765 hes a nice guy a good bloke and the last few years ive never seen him change
5564766 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
5564767 its like 90 yards of a touchdown it was so close but i didnt have much of a response
5564768 its disappointing i didnt win i have no regrets it certainly was a close race
5564769 el gobierno muestra cero tolerancia y rechaza el principio de ganar medallas a toda costa
5564770 es obvio que hay una red ilegal de dopaje y que el gobierno griego debe de actuar
5564771 el presidente sensi que hasta el ltimo momento ha sido part cipe de los asuntos de la sociedad contribuyendo a llevar a los primeros puestos de las clasificaciones italianas y europeas falleci en la noche del domingo confortado por el afecto de sus seres queridos
5564772 cualquier cruce es dif cil adem s el sistema de competici n es un poco duro porque da igual quedar segundo que tercero incluso es igual quedar primero que cuarto al final todo se decide en un partido as son las reglas
5564773 puede que no sea una equipo conocido pero tiene a la mayor a de sus jugadores en equipos espa oles y son una selecci n completa
5564774 el aspecto mental es m s f cil tenerlo a favor cuando hay ausencias porque los jugadores que est n saben que van a tener m s responsabilidad y se sienten m s importantes
5564775 we expect to be able to announce the independent funding of newco within this quarter
5564776 guide clinical trials toward patient populations where the highest likelihood of success should be observed thereby potentially lowering risk and shortening time to market
5564777 it was just numbers we never imagined we would ever see
5564778 at first we had no idea how we wanted to host this
5564779 the only thing i really knew of was traditional hosting setups where you have a service provider with monthlong contracts and you sign a contract for each server
5564780 this whole area of cloud computing is growing like crazy
5564781 we see this whole movement as a very disruptive change a tidal shift in the way it infrastructure is being consumed
5564782 we expect to be a multi cloud management system in the future
5564783 the future is about having a platform in the cloud
5564784 over the next decade you are going to see an incredible transformation in my opinion
5564785 it doesnt really make sense for most companies to have their own data centers just as it doesnt make sense for most companies to produce their own electric power
5564786 if you store a gigabyte of data for a month well send you a bill for 15 cents
5564787 to me cloud computing conjures up the image of something being very fluid and being very flexible
5564788 the benefits of the cloud are not only time to market but also pay as you go type of model
5564789 history shows us that the most disruptive and market changing technologies are ones that enable a broad class of people to do what previously only an elite class could do
5564790 i think it is a very very significant transformation the simplest way that i would explain it to my neighbor who isnt in the industry is that you know theres a computer on the desktop theres that computer in the data center you know that you walk by in your company but theres a new computer that is available up in the cloud and it is going to be transformational in terms of how people write and build solutions once they can assume that they can leverage that resource up there
5564791 salesforce com has done more than anybody just because of their willingness to go after the market
5564792 the big difference is that cloud computing is a much simpler approach that is easier for people to get from idea to application in a shorter period of time
5564793 the complexity is removed theres no need to think about software and versions things dont break as often the whole goal of cloud computing is to make business applications as easy as buying a book on amazon com
5564794 one of the big trends in cloud computing is not to make any one server super robust or super redundant but to handle redundancy through software
5564795 if a single server goes down or a rack or a whole data center goes down another one picks up
5564796 how much of your information do you really want hosted off site
5564797 thats a thorny little question that has to be addressed in order for cloud computing to work your data has to be stored off of your premises
5564798 as the industry solves both of those reliability and security i think were going to see massive massive scale out in the cloud
5564799 even if its a wild success today its going to blow your mind in the next two to three years
5564800 people are going to have to deal with the fact that the cloud is here to stay
5564801 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5564802 es complicado pero a la vez motiva porque es una se al de que conf an en ti
5564803 futbolistas como ellos hay pocos en la liga espa ola
5564804 en el vestuario siempre est igual alegre no creo que tenga ning n problema l no se quiere ir est muy contento en valencia y no me gustar a que se marchara porque tener a una persona como l en el vestuario es una alegr a yo me llevo muy bien con l
5564805 la temporada pasada tuve la mala suerte de la lesi n pero este a o he empezado bien y estoy contento con mi rendimiento hay que seguir as porque esto acaba de empezar mi idea es seguir jugando hacerlo lo mejor posible y si puedo ir a la selecci n para mi ser a un orgullo vestir esa camiseta tan bonita
5564806 no vas a volver a ponerte la camiseta del equipo nunca m s
5564807 un entrenador joven que est muy motivado y tiene muy claro cu l es su plan
5564808 es muy importante que haya continuidad que dejen hacer al m ster y que no se act e precipitadamente cada vez que algo no vaya bien
5564809 es un sue o poder jugar en una liga extranjera muy pocos pueden hacerlo estoy convencido de que fue el paso correcto
5564810 estamos en muy buena l nea aunque estas cosas siempre llevan su tiempo estamos hablando de david villa no de cualquier cosa est n m s o menos perfiladas las l neas para llegar a un acuerdo que creo que se va a alcanzar pr ximamente sin que haya problemas hemos sentado pr cticamente todas las bases y creo que en la pr xima reuni n que vamos a tener quedar todo solucionado
5564811 el presidente vicente soriano esta haciendo grandes esfuerzos para que esto se lleva a cabo no s lo lo de david sino tambi n muchas cosas para el club y veo la cosa bastante bien
5564812 porque no hay nada cerrado todav a aunque se hayan sentado bases de lo que quiere el valencia que sea villa aqu
5564813 como ya dije la pasada semana se puede garantizar al cien por cien por cien que villa se queda en el valencia porque esa es su ilusi n y ayer se le vio como siempre luchando a muerte
5564814 estamos cerca de alcanzar un acuerdo que probablemente se plasmar en las pr ximas fechas y lo que es seguro es que villa la temporada pr xima estar con nosotros el club esta haciendo un esfuerzo controlado moderado y dentro de nuestras posibilidades econ micas
5564815 estamos en un momento en el que por la cantidad de futbolistas que hay en la plantilla hay que dar muchas salidas y nuestro principal objetivo es tratar de mantener a estos dos jugadores y recuperar a algunos de la pasada temporada que bien estaban pero no ofrecieron su mejor rendimiento o bien no estaban y este a o pueden ser muy importantes
5564816 desde ni a siempre so aba con estar en unos juegos y que me saliera algo as pero ni en mis mejores sue os me imaginaba que ser a as me va a costar asimilarlo
5564817 desde el mundial donde hice cuarta me he ido mentalizando de que pod a subir al podio
5564818 llevaba tres o cuatro meses esperando se me ha hecho largo
5564819 a media carrera he tenido que tomar aire porque estaba siendo una prueba muy intensa
5564820 ten a la intenci n de entrar en el pen ltimo sprint pero pens que el ltimo ser a decisivo no sab a cuantas fuerzas me quedaban pero ten a que darlo todo
5564821 de todos los que han trabajado para que esto suceda porque si esta medalla es grande es por ellos
5564822 cuando estoy en un sprint es donde m s viva me siento me he enganchado a esta sensaci n al principio me asustaba pero poco a poco he ido ganando en confianza
5564823 si estoy aqu es por mi trabajo y tengo ganas de seguir trabajando y mejorando a lo mejor alg n d a apretamos m s a marianne vas
5564824 he tenido la suerte de conocerlo aunque sea al final de su carrera quiz en el momento m s fuerte es muy positivo tenerlo cerca por los consejos que da siempre ense a algo y yo tengo mucho que aprender
5564825 tengo un pinzamiento en el menisco y no s si voy a jugar lo tiene que valorar el m dico ma ana veremos si hace falta que me hagan una resonancia no puedo poner la pierna recta es doloroso pero por m jugar a sin una pierna
5564826 fue una hiperextensi n de la rodilla en uno de los muchos balones que nos robaron estos chicos que saltan tanto kobe bryant fue a hacer un mate y yo intent taponarle no llegu me ca y me doble la rodilla es doloroso vamos a ver lo que dice el m dico

5564828 dass es beim thema green procurement teilweise noch erheblichen nachholbedarf in vielen unternehmen gibt ist nicht nur auf deutschland begrenzt sondern berall in der industrie der fall wichtig ist vor allem dass das umdenken des einkaufs in hinblick auf die einhaltung kologischer und ethischer standards bei den unternehmen von oben dem top management erfolgt
5564829 obwohl noch ein gro er nachholbedarf besteht kologisch sinnvoll einzukaufen bessert sich die lage so stellen viele unternehmen vermehrt fest dass der preis einer ware oder dienstleistung in zunehmenden ma durch kologische faktoren beeinflusst wird
5564830 am ersten tag der olympischen spiele hielt sich die zahl der anfragen f r werbe und marketingauftritte noch sehr in grenzen
5564831 seit diesem wochenende erhalten wir rund 50 anfragen pro tag
5564832 ich mache das nun schon eine ganze weile aber mit dem was hier passiert habe ich ganz sicher nicht gerechnet
5564833 dieser wert k nnte sich nun aber zumindest kurzfristig verdoppeln
5564834 das interesse das ein sportler f r marketingzwecke hervorruft h ngt von mehreren aspekten ab
5564835 aber auch der stellenwert den eine spezifische sportart in einem bestimmten land inne hat ist in diesem zusammenhang ausschlaggebend
5564836 entscheidend ist auch wie oft ein sportler in der ffentlichkeit auftaucht im bereich des schwimmsports ist eine vermarktung deshalb schwieriger da nur zwei drei gro ereignisse pro jahr stattfinden
5564837 all diese faktoren ergeben den mehrwert eines sportler der festlegt wie interessant er im endeffekt f r das marketing von unternehmen ist
5564838 grunds tzlich stellt sich die frage ob man tats chlich so viele insekten f r ein gesundes kosystem braucht die antwort die wird gefunden haben macht es deutlich
5564839 zwar m gen die verschiedenen arten einer gruppe in einem kosystem scheinbar dieselbe funktion erf llen tats chlich reagieren sie aber in ihrem verhalten ganz unterschiedlich auf die so vielf ltigen umweltbedingungen
5564840 die nat rlicherweise vorkommende lebensraum heterogenit t ist eine entscheidende voraussetzung daf r dass die biodiversit t an bedeutung gewinnt so ist der komplement re effekt der verschiedenen arten dann am gr ten wenn auch die ressourcen in raum und zeit unterschiedlich verteilt sind

5564843 the shit he did thats what got me into heavy music vulgar display of power i was only into eighties music before that the heaviest thing i listened to was skinny puppy and ministry but that wasnt metal when i heard vulgar display i was like holy shit what the fuck is this the first time i ever saw them live before korn was even signed me and fieldy korn bassist went and it was pantera and sepultura at irving meadows in l a they came out started the first song the curtain dropped and me and fieldy just started crying we looked at each other and we had tears in our eyes because it was so fucking intense and heavy and sick
5564844 i always compare it to when steve perry went and did oh sherrie which is a fucking journey song
5564845 it sounded exactly like journey and thats fucked up i dont want to do that
5564846 i feel like im waving the flag for musicianship trying to bring back bands that can play
5564847 it seems like a lot of music today is so churned out and simple i like playing these festivals because its one thing all day and then here i come on and everyones like whoa then back to the grind
5564848 it sounds like a banjo but they sing with it and its the most fucking passionate emotional music ive ever heard in my life
5564849 i want to include that in my album because its so passionate like when you hear a korn song and its really going crazy these guys do it with a stringy banjo i want to bring that to kids here who are like what the fuck is this and open their minds up to something different
5564850 if they arent speaking up then doesnt that mean they are coping with it fine they believe in god and we have a healing service every six months isnt that enough
5564851 if a van was provided would you be able to get to church more easily would you listen to church on the internet if you were too ill to attend do you feel you can call and ask for occasional personal assistance especially if the illness is chronic and not acute do you know who to call would you like the worship song lyrics in the bulletin and not just on an overhead are the seats comfortable or would you prefer a few rows be saved for you with cushions
5564852 beyond casseroles 505 ways to encourage a chronically ill friend
5564853 so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from god
5564854 go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor the crippled the blind and the lame
5564855 they cant be obtrusive to neighborhoods and activities in and around them they have to be relatively quiet to get that low noise precision component you have make precision components
5564856 in the wind energy market the demand far exceeds the supply globally certainly the oil situation has brought on renewed interest
5564857 energy prices the traditional oil market continues to rise alternative energy like wind and solar are a great place to go to help keep the prices under control
5564858 its not just happening in north america its happening in asia its happening in europe for many years now were not just looking at north america were looking a global play
5564859 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5564860 the fact is most people are simply unaware of the full functionality of the product
5564861 by being first to market by having a high quality product and by providing high levels of service i think you can build a brand and establish yourself as a premier resource
5564862 within a corporation people are using google every day whether it is sales marketing research and development human resources and recruiting
5564863 the product is ubiquitous in its business use and yet people are not taking advantage of the functionality
5564864 we think the google piece of it is an overlooked piece
5564865 people just take for granted that everybody googles and nobody stops and thinks twice about the inefficiency in the process
5564866 12 or 15 young people standing there crying and with blood running down them

5564869 itll be hard for anyone to approach the level of attention that abraham lincoln gets because hes always classified as one of our greatest presidents
5564870 but i think theres a trend to learn more about the other side
5564871 biggest month of june in the history of the park
5564872 theres a lot of people that study jefferson davis and in the last few years theres been a lot more interest in his role not just in the war but in his experience before the war
5564873 i think theres a trend that there seems to be people who want to learn more about jefferson davis and what happened to him
5564874 clearly for whatever reason people are finding a reason to visit those lincoln sites and looking at the lincoln legacy in kentucky
5564875 the interest is there and i think its fair to say that there has probably never been as much focus on lincolns kentucky connection as there is now
5564876 we intend to take whatever actions are necessary to try to continue to minimize the burden thats going to be placed on average consumers around the country
5564877 athanasius isnt treating us arians like christian brothers blah blah blah

5564879 interning at the mackinac center was one of the most enjoyable and intellectually stimulating times of my life
5564880 i learned tremendously from the centers superlative employees and recommend center internships to anyone interested in learning about liberty and advancing its cause
5564881 the mackinac center rounded out my education it was the perfect finishing school
5564882 i cant think of a better way to transition from an academic environment to the business environment even after 10 years i still draw from the leadership examples i experienced at the mackinac center
5564883 what if the student is already enrolled in an old section
5564884 he dropped two balls that were very critical in a team setting but came back the next practice and made the plays he was supposed to make
5564885 thats what we need from him that consistency and hes shown it and hes added the ability to run after the catch and thats just a recognition of where the defense is and playing with great speed hes also become a much more physical blocker
5564886 weve known all along he has the big play ability but to be a great one you have to be locked in and focused on every snap and make every catch he has also worked hard on playing stronger and playing against press coverage the bottom line is hes got to play well for us to be successful
5564887 what you cant allow defensive teams to do is play eight man fronts and then win the one on ones because if that happens it is checkmate and we cant win
5564888 so when we have those one on ones we should be striking up the band and kicking extra points you have to take advantage of that as a receiver all you want is one on ones but once you get it you have to win it oderick has done a great job of playing physical at the line and getting off that press coverage
5564889 ive wanted to work on the little things work on my technique work on the things that will make me a better all around receiver
5564890 i think the thing is you have to get better each year you have to mature as a player because you cant just be a one hit wonder any more i want to be a complete receiver i want to get stronger faster and be able to add some more things to my arsenal now
5564891 i feel like i am a lot better now with my blocking and my route running
5564892 my goal in the offseason was to try and take my game to the next level and i feel i have done that
5564893 i have no problem taking on the role as the go to receiver but i dont put a lot of stock into that im just right now trying to play the game the best way you know how

5564899 i asked my grandfather about the holy prophet sallallahu alaihi wassallam and he explained that when he became aware of the presence of nabi alaihis salaam in makkah he left his homeland to go there and when he met the holy prophet sallallahu alaihi wassallam he was asked are you ibn salaam

5564909 just because someone is fleshiness doesnt mean they should not be entitled to undergo boob recollection after mastectomy
5564910 feeling whole crapper be an integral conception of feat from cancer still momentous concerns have been raised about the wisdom of doing boob recollection in very fat patients due to a high complexness rate
5564911 we investigated whether impressible surgeons crapper safely action boob recollection for these patients or if we would be depriving them recollection exclusive because of empiric concerns for their weight
5564912 we found that significantly fat patients those having a bmi of 35 or higher had a higher venture for complications our experience suggests that in many cases it may be more discreet to delay boob recollection until the enduring has lost weight
5564913 while its very difficult to tell a enduring she needs to wait for boob reconstruction enduring country is our direct concern
5564914 we staleness not cooperation the medicine imperative in boob cancer each housing staleness be individualized morbidly fat patients requirement to impact with their impressible surgeons and carefully set venture factors patients may be prizewinning served by deferring boob recollection until they have achieved and maintained a lower bmi through exercise and nutrition

5564917 users want to consume everything from first run branded content to user generated content but the mobile video viewing experience has been far too frustrating for it to become an everyday consumer activity
5564918 vuclip solves this problem by delivering video to mobile phones the way people want it when they want it wherever they are
5564919 as the provider of a free mobile media service we looked at our options for delivering mobile video to mippin users and it was clear to us that vuclip was the right option because of the services universal compatibility with handsets and carriers
5564920 the vuclip api is so easy to use that it took only a couple of days to do the end to end integration
5564921 i won one from the group and i have to say it its the most amazing thing ever i absolutely love it with the notebook they include i never miss a word
5564922 i just got mine its great i cant wait to start taking notes with it
5564923 i have to say that as much as i love using the pen the best part is showing it off people are amazed
5564924 because of the fast pace of most lectures students usually have to decide whether they listen to the lecture or focus on taking accurate notes they cant do both well with the smartpen they can take fewer notes knowing that they can go back to them later and replay the audio
5564925 as a teacher ive discovered pulse is less distracting than students who take notes using a laptop computer
5564926 this included operation eastlinker which ran for several weeks and involved 24 hour tasked patrols enforcing traffic offences

5564934 we had to look at business conditions and then make changes that still ensured the integrity of our products to both our readers and our advertisers that brought us to layoffs something that is never easy but unfortunately a reality in this economy
5564935 we cant promise that unfortunately economic conditions drive our destiny

5564941 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance
5564942 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
5564943 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
5564944 and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5564945 they did it to massachusetts sen john kerry they did it to former vice president al gore they tried to do it to former president clinton they did it to former massachusetts gov michael dukakis
5564946 thats what they do thats their politics they dont know how to govern they know how to run a negative campaign
5564947 in order for us to win we not only have to beat the attack machine weve got to win back the trust of the american people
5564948 the same guys that brought you george bush are now trying to bring you john mccain theyve basically got the same strategy which is they cant win an argument on ideas so what theyre going to do is theyre going to try to attack me
5564949 this may not be directly affiliated with the campaign but you know suddenly magically you got the same guy who wrote unfit for command
5564950 he comes out with a new book saying that im a nut
5564951 in the term of the next president skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far reaching disaster
5564952 unless you are in the top one tenth of 1 in this country you are not better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago
5564953 its because of that experience that when i hear that women are being treated unfairly in the workplace where theres injustice and were not seeing the basic principle of equal pay for equal work i get mad and i get frustrated
5564954 ya kami juga tidak menyangka tiba tiba jsmr masuk mengambil alih mna

5564956 kami dengan mna telah memiliki kontrak senilai rp 1 triliun untuk pengerjaan kontraktor mna tadinya kami berharap dengan akuisisi mna pengerjaan akan lebih lancar
5564957 jadi ceritanya mna itu kesulitan dana untuk menggarap proyek tolnya sehingga mereka berencana melepas sahamnya pada kami agar pengerjaan proyek lebih cepat

5565183 based on extensive interviews with participants contemporaneous notes and secret documents the book traces the internal debates tensions and critical turning points in the iraq war during an extraordinary two year period
5565184 ces questions ont t r solues depuis longtemps pour autant que je sache
5565185 ive gotten literally hundreds of letters over the last week from women saying they would still love it if she were the nominee or if he would pick her
5565186 theres a case for hillary to be on the ticket but the real question is is bill a voice for the campaign and the administration and what do you do about disclosing all of the donors to his foundation and his library
5565187 picking her would have a groundswell impact on democrats but not picking her will leave her to have a new role leading on her issues and supporting barack for president
5565188 i think the convention will help bring the wings of the party together especially the fact that sen clintons name will be put in nomination for a roll call vote that will make a big difference
5565189 as for picking sen clinton as vice president thats sen obamas decision
5565190 if he determines that hillary after all is the best choice to help him to win and to govern
5565191 ive been in a scramble to get caught up before school starts so i dont drowned in photos
5565192 that way i have it all in front of me and i dont have to remember that i had those cute ki stickers that are with the letter accent stickers
5565193 thick regolith loads the gcr dose rate could be brought down so that missions of many years might be medically feasible
5565194 be enabled by using regolith as shielding against jupiters intense radiation belts
5565195 we didnt believe it at first then she began holding my mothers hand and then we saw her open her mouth
5565196 when i came to the morgue to collect her her body was wrapped up
5565197 then my wife asked to see her again when i got there we realised she was moving
5565198 we dont know how to explain this so when we dont know how to explain things in the medical world we call it a miracle this is probably what happened
5565199 he has served his sentence and the authorities in vietnam will deport him he does not have any sentence to serve in london if he wants to stop wherever he wants to he can do that
5565200 if he wants to he can change flights he is a free man from today the only problem is the countries he wants to go to because he has to get a visa
5565201 i would hope that the authorities make sure that gary glitter does not slip off to another country
5565202 once youre overseas you can just go from country to country we know that some of the most high risk offenders do that
5565203 glitter is a persistent offender responsible for a catalogue of sexual crimes against children on his return to the uk the authorities must assess the level of risk he poses to children and make sure he is carefully managed and supervised in the community to keep children safe from harm
5565204 it is not business as usual it has damaged its standing
5565205 i would rather know now where some of the european nations stand than much later when the stakes may be larger
5565206 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5565207 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5565208 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
5565209 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome
5565210 its so easy anyone can do it were looking forward to doing it over and over again
5565211 the concierge found the property for me with just a click of a mouse there it is they also found the mortgage company they found my lease option tenant they did all the work and we were able to close in our own living room
5565212 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5565213 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise

5565217 the concierge found the property for me with just a click of a mouse there it is they also found the mortgage company they found my lease option tenant they did all the work and we were able to close in our own living room
5565218 he did this because he was stressed at work if you turn your head if you concentrate hard our skeletons will stay buried in our own backyard
5565219 shes a great athlete no matter how old she is
5565220 i do not want to embarass myself by telling the survey guy that i have no fucking clue

5565222 grunds tzlich stellt sich die frage ob man tats chlich so viele insekten f r ein gesundes kosystem braucht die antwort die wird gefunden haben macht es deutlich
5565223 zwar m gen die verschiedenen arten einer gruppe in einem kosystem scheinbar dieselbe funktion erf llen tats chlich reagieren sie aber in ihrem verhalten ganz unterschiedlich auf die so vielf ltigen umweltbedingungen
5565224 die nat rlicherweise vorkommende lebensraum heterogenit t ist eine entscheidende voraussetzung daf r dass die biodiversit t an bedeutung gewinnt so ist der komplement re effekt der verschiedenen arten dann am gr ten wenn auch die ressourcen in raum und zeit unterschiedlich verteilt sind
5565225 dass es beim thema green procurement teilweise noch erheblichen nachholbedarf in vielen unternehmen gibt ist nicht nur auf deutschland begrenzt sondern berall in der industrie der fall wichtig ist vor allem dass das umdenken des einkaufs in hinblick auf die einhaltung kologischer und ethischer standards bei den unternehmen von oben dem top management erfolgt
5565226 obwohl noch ein gro er nachholbedarf besteht kologisch sinnvoll einzukaufen bessert sich die lage so stellen viele unternehmen vermehrt fest dass der preis einer ware oder dienstleistung in zunehmenden ma durch kologische faktoren beeinflusst wird
5565227 am ersten tag der olympischen spiele hielt sich die zahl der anfragen f r werbe und marketingauftritte noch sehr in grenzen
5565228 seit diesem wochenende erhalten wir rund 50 anfragen pro tag
5565229 ich mache das nun schon eine ganze weile aber mit dem was hier passiert habe ich ganz sicher nicht gerechnet
5565230 dieser wert k nnte sich nun aber zumindest kurzfristig verdoppeln
5565231 das interesse das ein sportler f r marketingzwecke hervorruft h ngt von mehreren aspekten ab
5565232 aber auch der stellenwert den eine spezifische sportart in einem bestimmten land inne hat ist in diesem zusammenhang ausschlaggebend
5565233 entscheidend ist auch wie oft ein sportler in der ffentlichkeit auftaucht im bereich des schwimmsports ist eine vermarktung deshalb schwieriger da nur zwei drei gro ereignisse pro jahr stattfinden
5565234 all diese faktoren ergeben den mehrwert eines sportler der festlegt wie interessant er im endeffekt f r das marketing von unternehmen ist
5565235 i made a commitment to temple that i was going to make it and make it right
5565236 i never pushed to get it made until now because now we got it right
5565237 i dont want to embarrass any other catcher by comparing him to johnny bench
5565238 thank you to organized labor for all your support thank you labor 2008
5565239 i want to thank you so much for all the hard work you have done for me in the past and all the amazing work you are doing supporting barack obama with your support we know that barack obama will be president and working families will have a strong advocate in the white house
5565240 all we have to do is let our members know how the candidates stand on the issues a simple comparison is all it takes to see how bad senator mccains record is towards unions and how barack obama has a proven record of standing up for working families
5565241 as a union member and an iraq war veteran i cant support john mccain in the senate he voted against crucial funding for soldiers coming home from war that could have gone to badly needed medical treatment when it comes to unions mccain has proven his disregard for working families by supporting privatization and opposing the employee free choice act when i got out of the service i needed a good middle class job so that i could support my family if mccain had his way he would privatize the postal service and i wouldnt have that opportunity

5565243 noel gallagher said i should learn three chords on the guitar and go write a tune so i just wanted him to know that im actually taking guitar lessons from jay z right now and hes already taught me both chords to wonderwall
5565244 in fact its so much fun having jay teach me all of noels songs on the guitar hooray that im thinking of doing an oasis jay z remix album like danger mouses grey album
5565245 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
5565246 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness
5565247 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
5565248 2012 will be a massive test of the quality of our public space not just in london but right across the country when people gather in all the major civic spaces to watch and celebrate so are we ready local authorities have four years to get it right
5565249 she assumed when the police took him out by gunpoint saturday night that she would have time to get her stuff and get out
5565250 there are some medical concerns there i wont get into that
5565251 she had been in contact with all of us about it
5565252 orang tua saya tak tahu apa yang saya lakukan mereka pikir saya bermalam di rumah teman
5565253 gadis gadis di sini umumnya punya mobil sendiri di dalam klub mereka hanya deal harga lalu bertemu dengan teman kencannya di tempat yang ditentukan
5565254 he knew very little english but knew nothing about computers whoever meets him even for a short while can make out his capabilities he could write a little could not even speak effectively he was a very ordinary man
5565255 it is a lie that abu basher and mujahid saleem were friends he came to hyderabad only after mujahids death
5565256 the county put us in this position but the city is not helping us get out we have to plan for the worst and hope for the best
5565257 this is depth coming from the roots of this tree it is feeding us
5565258 i got a lot out of the workshop so here i am this is my first direct action as a good ole mountain girl im just tired of the people being bullied she said
5565259 ive been in jail for things i did ive been in jail for things i didnt do and i havent been in jail for things i shouldve been but if im here when it happens what can i say ill stay
5565260 wanted little to do with myers in photos from the rare occasions they would attend shows together his expression is dour he saw myers as ambitious insecure and overly american she saw him as an overpaid out of control spendthrift who was losing his touch
5565261 although numerous principals and insiders were interviewed for this piece few wanted to have their names associated with a story about the inner workings of their current or former place of employment
5565262 i strongly believe that if any reporter anywhere is going to write about why somebody did something they should have asked that person that story is full of quotes about why i did what i did how could they possibly know why i did anything or what motivated me to do anything in my job unless they ask me even if someone else where to speculate about why i did something the fact that nobody called me even to fact check it is egregious
5565263 i was a crazy add kid so my parents were like ok maybe he can be enthusiastic on stage
5565264 its like when you get to age eight they put you in softball just because thats what you do mine just happened to be acting
5565265 i love the knickers i do man i dont know why
5565266 wardrobe to me is such a big thing its like putting on a batman suit you dont see batman out being amazingly heroic without his suit on
5565267 ive had to make decisions on the show that have been a struggle in the moment but now im sort of past that
5565268 i think spanish golfer sergio garcia will have noticed the tear in rafael nadals eye at the tennis medals ceremony the other day
5565269 we have information not only that they were present but that pamela buning was allowing this to go on as the childs mother she is in a position with responsibility to look after her child
5565270 for her to allow this to go on apparently with her approval i consider that to be her participation in child abuse
5565271 there are recorded phone conversations involving mcdonald batchelor and buning planning how they were going to lie their way out of serious injuries to her son the evidence i expect is going to show all three of these people worked together to fabricate a lying story that if believed would clear any and all of them in any wrong doing
5565272 i dont fault them at all i think really the blame is on the people hurting this child and the mothers failure to properly protect her son
5565273 i put the blame squarely on the shoulders of the mother and the abuser mcdonald i think the evidence will show that those are the two people that teamed up to cause this tragedy
5565274 the online chicago tribune led the way adding a widget
5565275 misalnya karena adanya provokasi dari akkbb melalui iklan koran yang mereka muat beberapa hari sebelumnya
5565276 oh thats who was making that noise he sounded like a siren
5565277 the military will continue to fight and the political government will continue to negotiate the negotiations have to continue as it is now an issue of saving pakistani society from the hands of the taliban
5565278 it has very fragile public support it doesnt want to lose that public support by going hard after the militants but at the same time it knows it must do so
5565279 this is a positive change but it is just the beginning
5565280 if the government ends these policies the taliban will stop their activities immediately
5565281 their new found cockiness has got some substance to it
5565282 every single aspect was done from one room in his council house
5565283 the resources boom is providing employment and increased wealth for western australians but its also driving up carbon pollution and putting immense pressure on our fragile environment
5565284 the state election provides an opportunity for politcal parties to respond to public concern on the environment by committing to urgent and decisive action to prevent dangerous climate change and build a sustainable economy for the future
5565285 nothing more than another unnecessary and costly tax on businesses and consumers
5565286 their retail investments have been a mixed bag although there have been successful ones
5565287 it is very difficult to see what is going on with the underlying strategy which is probably what they want
5565288 vull ser el primer michael phelps no el segon mark spitz
5565289 volia fer alguna cosa en aquest esport que ning hagu s fet abans

5565291 you dont know what youre talking about you dont understand gambians
5565292 estoy muy bien ya m s tranquilo y mentalizado para ocupar un sitio de honor en la final
5565293 you know that period at the end of the night when that girl youve been eyeing at the end of the bar gets up and stumbles to the door to leave without saying goodbye to you even though you made eye contact with her like twice and she just heads out and you have no choice but to follow her and rape her and then leave her on the side of the road bloodied or in a river if you accidentally killed her while you were forcing your 300 pounds of man on top of her
5565294 my husband tells me you always put away his clothing after doing his laundry
5565295 men find god in varying ways even within the christian fold
5565296 generally a mans arm span equals his height but in his case its 6 7 three inches more than his height naturally his arms work as powerful propulsive paddles giving him a clear edge over others his lower body interestingly is shorter than that of an average man of his height his relatively short legs result in less drag or resistance in short phelps has an upper body of a 6 8 person but his lower body seems to be of someone who is only 5 10 which also make the perfect plane in water
5565297 just a normal person from a different planet a planet from a different galaxy
5565298 im just as surprised as you that im in this movie
5565299 there is no black and white and there are various degrees but at the extremes i have found the following to be true of high self esteem hse women and low self esteem lse women
5565300 until the companies are far enough along in their negotiations with customers to be able to say yes weve signed up a majority of our volume for next year at fixed prices and here is where the average selling prices fall out then the markets just taking a wait and see approach
5565301 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5565302 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5565303 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction
5565304 emigrating from the former soviet union where opportunities were limited i came to this country with the drive and motivation to succeed and was ready to face the obstacles and hurdles that came along with running my own business being named franchisee of the year is an honor especially when considering the number of excellent candidates that were also considered
5565305 i share this honor with my store managers who help me make sure that all aspects of the business are in order including store cleanliness customer service and ultimately improved sales
5565306 it will be one of the slowest days of the year and i think it just kind of fed into itself
5565307 theres just not enough people to work in the restaurants the pay is so much better
5565308 prices keep going up because they know they can get it
5565309 if youre in the market for a travel trailer good luck theyre flying off the lots
5565310 im having to shop in houston austin and san antonio to find one
5565311 please lord let there be another boom i promise i wont piss it away next time
5565312 this is a much more measured intelligent response than it was 25 years ago
5565313 im just fearful that they dont get caught up on a trap like they did before
5565314 the objectives were to provide product trial among a key physician group to accelerate uptake of vioxx as the second entrant in a highly competitive new class
5565315 i dont think people would be willing to risk side effects if they knew that the aim of a clinical trial was to boost profits for a pharmaceutical company
5565316 i would think that at some level this is standard practice
5565317 the old john mccain wouldnt have allowed one of jack abramoffs top cronies to raise money for him
5565318 but this time around its clear that senator mccain is willing to do whatever it takes to win
5565319 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5565320 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5565321 weve been hearing for a few weeks that the obama campaign believes it hasnt been tough enough on mccain
5565322 does this mean the convention week will be tougher on mccain than either gore or kerry were on bush
5565323 zell miller says you give the troops spitballs to defend themselves and what did you do nothin
5565324 even if i lose this round ill probably get paired up again
5565325 crap i could get the bye in round three if i lose this round that would really suck
5565326 i dont think it will work if its not mandatory
5565327 were looking at getting 20 percent involved in the project which will be good for a town of this size
5565328 we are trying to do a public outreach to get people involved in this
5565329 obviously this is something were concerned about well get to the bottom of it
5565330 obviously theyve had this in the planning stage for some time
5565331 the arm is already damaged when they do surgery they will just fix it all then
5565332 the war within a secret white house history 2006 2008
5565333 there has not been such an authoritative and intimate account of presidential decision making since the nixon tapes and the pentagon papers
5565334 this is the declassification of what went on in secret behind the scenes
5565335 takes readers deep inside the white house the pentagon the state department the intelligence agencies and the u s military headquarters in iraq
5565336 based on extensive interviews with participants contemporaneous notes and secret documents the book traces the internal debates tensions and critical turning points in the iraq war during an extraordinary two year period

5565341 we are concerned that if this issue is not urgently addressed it is only a matter of time before there is an avoidable death of a client in one of our communities due to delay in transfer to hospital
5565342 the government still does not understand the urgency of the issue
5565343 we now say how many more deaths will occur not when will the next death occur

5565397 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5565398 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5565399 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5565400 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5565401 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this

5565412 it is not rocket science here we could actually move aboriginal people across into these jobs he said to abc television
5565413 thirty years ago 20 years ago we were the fruit pickers we were the cotton chippers we did all this rural work we were the unskilled labourers in the rural industry
5565414 we created a false economy and then people got used to the idea of staying at home rather than actually going out and looking for work he said
5565415 in other words the requirements that we will put in place will ensure that if there is an australian or someone based in australia who is ready willing and able to work in the horticulture industry then theyll get the jobs first he said macquarie radio in sydney
5565416 were going to review that pilot program halfway through to see whether its a success to whether the requirements weve put in place are working effectively mr smith said
5565417 and if it is successful to see whether it might be sensible to expand the capacity to other areas of australia or indeed to other countries in the pacific

5565451 israeli policies are designed to limit the number of palestinians living in areas earmarked for settlements or in their vicinity
5565452 the israeli authorities have for many years applied a discriminatory policy of house demolitions permitting on the one hand many tens of israeli settlements to be built on occupied palestinian territory in flagrant violation of international law at the same time as they confiscate palestinian lands forbidding the palestinian population to build and destroying their houses the cleared land is often used to build illegal israeli settlements international law prohibits occupying powers from building settlements for their own citizens on the territories they occupy

5565468 the imposition of multiple taxes on adult material will likely result in less in state production and more internet based purchases from out of state businesses where collection of use taxes is more problematic these developments would result in an unknown but potentially significant reduction in gf general fund sales and income taxes

5565473 one of your clients the broadcasting board of governors bbg which handles the broadcasts of radio free asia and voice of america has just withdrawn from w5

5565475 we cannot resume broadcasting for technical reasons contact our competitors
5565476 with the olympic games taking place in china it is vital that chinese tv viewers should have the possibility of accessing independent news and information
5565477 we therefore urge you now to take the necessary measures so that ntdtv broadcasts are again transmitted by the w5 satellite the many protests by the stations viewers demonstrate its utility and importance
5565478 jenna is really very good in this movie and i think that acting comedy and sex come together quite
5565479 teagan is extremely good and her fans get to see an entirely different side of her as tabitha becomes one sexy 18 year old cutie
5565480 i will say her sex scene with the little doll that she magically turns into a full sized man is the sexiest hardcore scene i have ever shot
5565481 that was so much fun to make because ron jeremy and sunny and i had to pop in and out of the orgy like magic

5565486 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5565487 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5565488 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5565489 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5565490 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5565491 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5565492 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5565493 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5565494 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them

5565503 jeremy has called canada his home for the past five years and has just recently celebrated the birth of his second child if there was ever a case to grant refugee status on compassionate and humanitarian grounds this is it
5565504 ordinary canadians have already said yes to jeremy hinzman and to his family
5565505 they have spoken through their parliament they want to let mr hinzman and other u s iraq war resisters stay in canada

5565584 so many people have been worried and caring about me i feel sorry i could do nothing but pull out of the race
5565585 i didnt feel right when i was warming up before the race i knew my foot would fail me
5565586 i am not that type of person i never quit easily i believe i will come back
5565587 from him from his tenacious struggle with injuries over the years his last minute attempt to defeat the pains in particular we saw fine sportsmanship at work
5565588 i just focus on the track to beat my rivals one by one i try to do it simply just get on the track and ride
5565589 now this whole musharraf excuse is behind us now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5565590 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5565591 i am going with the satisfaction that whatever i have done was for the people and for the country i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5565592 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5565593 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5565594 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5565595 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order
5565596 its a huge challenge and they cannot face it individually its very important for them to work together and i think they know that
5565597 america wants some immediate decisions on fighting terrorism and i dont think they will be able to concentrate on that
5565598 on the other hand are the people of this country the business community and there too i dont see any new initiatives
5565599 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5565600 whatever one might say it may be difficult for the politicians to give him the indemnity
5565601 there were certain elements who were politicking with the economy and terrorism
5565602 the situation is moving in a positive manner the tension is now being cooled down
5565603 the situation has improved quite a lot in regards to the standoff between the militaries from both sides
5565604 the tension around the area has been eased we hope very much that the situation will go back to normal as soon as possible
5565605 we dont think too much about it thats the name of the game
5565606 we dont care about the streak were just focusing on that medal
5565607 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5565608 i think you can expect a strong message to russia
5565609 decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era

5565617 lonely planet seems to think that stonehenge aotearoa is an imitation of stonehenge in britain but this is completely wrong
5565618 ive been to both it and the original stonehenge in britain and theres no contest stonehenge aotearoa is by far the most interesting experience said ms varnham
5565619 when i heard it was brazil i was cheering in doping control
5565620 this team wants to reclaim what we could have gotten
5565621 one of the most amazing things with our team is we dont have that big name player
5565622 that abby wambach that mia hamm that julie foudy people dont really know us
5565623 i think the one thing that we took from that is that its impossible to win a championship if were not on the same page
5565624 it would be arrogant for me to ignore it and say lets move on
5565625 i got five different stories about what happened and i had two questions do you want to win do we need a goalkeeper
5565626 after checking with both team and local hospital officials we figured he should no longer fight because it could threaten his life
5565627 baik wanted to fight but we stopped him from doing so
5565628 my fellow americans we are a country in debt and in decline not terminal not irreversible but in decline our political system seems incapable of producing long range answers to big problems or big opportunities we are the ones who need a better functioning democracy more than the iraqis and afghans we are the ones in need of nation building it is our political system that is not working
5565629 business as usual is too much for them to digest
5565630 this is what i have been waiting for forever said azevedo a three time olympian
5565631 was as close to a dysfunctional family as you can find
5565632 they felt like they were outcasts in a way schroeder said
5565633 they felt almost like usa water polo turned its back on them
5565634 that just about killed me he said of the programs loss of prestige
5565635 everybody came out of that saying potentially we can do this schroeder said
5565636 tanked in order to play spain instead of montenegro another water polo power from the former yugoslavia
5565637 everybody knows whats happened said croatia coach ratko rudic whose team probably would have won group b with a serbian victory
5565638 threw a match to face the united states in the semifinals rather than yugoslavia the ploy motivated the americans to knock out russia

5565640 you are in excellent health for someone your age and it is because of your running
5565641 i encourage my children to strive to do their best in everything but the pursuit of perfection is something else destructive and fool hardy
5565642 moving from a difficult goal to another more attainable one can create a greater sense of well being both mentally and physically
5565643 in this age of instant gratification we dont want to teach our children that just because something is difficult means its not worth pursuing we want them know the joy of mastery of accomplishing an arduous task
5565644 but allowing your child to quit can be the right move if you understand the reasons behind it
5565645 we have pockets of severe malnutrition in some districts in the south and an emergency situation in the somali region

5565650 its very obvious now that the opposition tried to change the outcome of the election by unconstitutional means we felt we had to clamp down we detained them and we took them to court the leaders of the opposition have realized they made a mistake and they asked for a pardon and the government has pardoned them all
5565651 up to the international community to deploy a peacekeeping force in somali without delay to avoid a vacuum and the resurgence of extremists and terrorists
5565652 before we intervened about a year ago now the transitional federal government tfg were on the verge of collapse and the islamic courts union were on the verge of taking complete and full control of somalia that is no longer on the cards that is a tremendous change
5565653 we are supposed to have burned villages in the ogaden i can tell you not a single village and as far as i know not a single hut has been burned we have been accused of dislocating thousands of people from their villages and keeping them in camps nobody has come up with a shred of evidence
5565654 this is a counterinsurgency i am not going to tell you there hasnt been anyone beaten up i am absolutely confident that there has not been any widespread violation of human rights
5565655 there are no political prisoners in ethiopia at the moment those in prison are insurgents so it is difficult to explain a situation of political prisoners because there are none however insurgents and militants have been imprisoned because of their militant and violent acts and we will see what the court decides on that

5565668 you have to wonder at times what youre doing out there over the years ive given myself a thousand reasons to keep running but it always comes back to where it started it comes down to self satisfaction and a sense of achievement
5565669 in running it doesnt matter whether you come in first in the middle of the pack or last you can say i have finished there is a lot of satisfaction in that
5565670 racing teaches us to challenge ourselves it teaches us to push beyond where we thought we could go it helps us to find out what we are made of this is what we do this is what its all about
5565671 running is a big question mark thats there each and every day

5565766 thirty years ago 20 years ago we were the fruit pickers we were the cotton chippers we did all this rural work we were the unskilled labourers in the rural industry

5565768 in other words the requirements that we will put in place will ensure that if there is an australian or someone based in australia who is ready willing and able to work in the horticulture industry then theyll get the jobs first he said macquarie radio in sydney

5565823 the main thing for england is you need players who can play under pressure and do it under the spotlight because you know there is a lot of criticism waiting from the public
5565824 youve got to deal with that that is the hardest obstacle we are going to get over as a team playing under that intense pressure some players can do it better than others that is just how it is we need england to get over that psychological barrier
5565825 its a process we might not go out there on wednesday and win 6 0 and have everyone saying we can be world champions we have to be realistic and build on our confidence
5565826 playing for chelsea and playing for england are two completely different things international football is different
5565827 i wouldnt say any one player lacks confidence we need to improve our mentality as a team we are doing that were not burying our heads in the sand we are trying to play and get the ball down we need to stay cool and calm
5565828 its pigeon steps the world cup isnt for two years we need to improve slowly so when we get there we are better physically mentally and technically as a group its something we need to improve on we are doing things to improve we need to go out there and be free results help that theres no science to it you need the results to breed confidence

5565846 i think the expectation in the community is that until we have the higher end destination retail there isnt any reason to shop downtown so we have to do it
5565847 saks fifth avenues departure would make the opportunity to attract similar retailers even less compelling
5565848 indeed one has to wonder whether the ubiquitous brands already in the golden triangle talbots ann taylor joseph a bank clothiers and bailey banks amp biddle would remain if the upscale anchor were to leave
5565849 if we can work to put something together with a property owner and a retailer and take it to them we think they would be receptive to that

5565874 today when i am reading to you i will be holding the book like this but i am going to stop along the way and share my thinking i will tell you what my inner voice inside is saying all readers have a reading voice that reads the words this voice is called our reciting voice we have a second voice that talks in our heads about what we are reading that voice is called our conversation voice inner voice when i am sharing my thinking it will look like this i will close the book and look out at you thats how youll know i am sharing my thinking then ill open the book back up like this and continue reading the words
5565875 how come he just did that i sure would have been more careful
5565876 no way they broke it oh my whats going to happen next
5565877 maybe you guys could try this when you are reading at home and at school
5565878 today when i am reading i want you to watch what you see me doing and listen to what you hear my saying be ready to turn and talk about this and then share back
5565879 o k turn and talk with a partner about what you saw me doing and heard me saying when i was reading this book
5565880 mary and i saw you read a little bit and then you closed the book and said what was in your head and then you went back to the book
5565881 we heard you stop reading after and tell us what you were thinking
5565882 marty and i heard you ask a question after reading
5565883 renni and i noticed you were not just reading the words and thats it
5565884 manuel and i heard you thinking about what you were reading
5565885 we heard you tell about how you thought must be feeling
5565886 we heard you tell us that you how you thought the sounded
5565887 we heard you say that you thought the author was really meaning
5565888 today when you are reading i want you to try and catch your inner voice talking to you as you are reading take 3 5 post its and when you hear your inner voice i want you to write down what it is saying stick the post it right where that thinking bubbled up in your head be ready to meet with others to share how it was for you to catch that inner voice and how it felt to you as you were reading
5565889 oh that doesnt make any sense i need to go back and reread that part
5565890 well that didnt help now i am going to read on a bit and see if that helps me out
5565891 well rereading didnt help me reading on didnt help me so now i am going to have to find someone to ask because i cant go on if i dont understand this part

5565901 a company in gothenburg did some 3d mapping with a stereo scanner for dr laila kitzler hfeldt to study regarding the carving technique and groove profiles in the end she didnt receive any funding to actually perform the study but the data is still around and useable we also studied the stone by eye for a few hours in this brief interval however we collected no quantitative data furthermore we exchanged views with scott wolter a geologist who has examined the stone neither his investigations nor our own impressions can date the inscription as you can see we dont have enough material or results to write a reasonable paper
5565902 the runological content is still more important to the dating issue than any available natural science criteria im sure the last word hasnt been said yet sooner or later someone will figure out a better method to pinpoint the date but a method for direct dating of rock carvings is hard to conceive of the stone hasnt exactly been treated with silk gloves since it was unearthed i have no problem with confessing my uncertainty in this case i do however feel that it is suspect i recall that when the exhibition opened a journalist asked me if i could determine the stones age after looking at it for a minute or two when i said no he mumbled something about scientific idiot pretty laughable really

5565908 i find you distasteful and vaguely menacing please go away
5565909 for all practical purposes i am an atheist myself since im only a nominal deist and dont believe that has anything to do with our lives at all
5565910 the melancholy truth is that decent understated religion is numerically negligible
5565911 i find you distasteful and vaguely menacing please go away
5565912 in which every major media outlet has engaged in serious discussions of the issue
5565913 in an environment where biologists had agreed not to get into quarrels involving religion
5565914 whether or not you believe in a deity however is a choice that almost everyone makes
5565915 the only thing im objecting to is the use of extremist rhetoric rhetoric that declares all religious people to be stupid or deluded or that uses metaphors of violence that kind of rhetoric i maintain not only does not serve the goal of overcoming such prejudices it reinforces those prejudices it does us no good and i think it needs to be stopped
5565916 come out loud and proud as long as i think youre acceptable
5565917 you must be willing to change your mind admit you are wrong when the evidence shows it and move on scientific progress would be impossible without that kind of receptiveness to change
5565918 somehow i doubt dawkins would have needed to write an entire book just to say that
5565919 if god wanted to could she change the value of pi
5565920 neither ed nor matt nisbet before him has provided a shred of evidence to back up the assertion that dawkins and hitchens are hurting the cause
5565921 but non belief also raises paradoxes that the believer would also say negates its plausibility again though my point is that when both sides are followed to their end they both suffer from the same ultimate problem a lack of cause to the effect where did god come from he just is or for the non believer where did existence come from it just is
5565922 in studies of cognitive dissonance it is clear that the tension created between what people want to believe and what is true is magnified by contradictory evidence which is releived by strengthening ones beliefs hence evangelicals when confronted with evidence that their creationist anti evolutionary beliefs are false respond by intensifying those beliefs rather than abandoning them but this can only go so far at some point the internal tension becomes unbearable and the whole system collapses the benefit of people like hitchens and dawkins is precisely that they are not letting up they are pressing the point further and further increasing the tension so that it reaches an unbearable limit leading to the collapse of reified mythical christianity
5565923 i am a naughty chicken for i have not laid an egg
5565924 and as far as i know dawkins used the term faith head precisely once and he was plainly not referring to all religious people when he did so he was referring to the extremists who refuse to even consider his arguments
5565925 of course dyed in the wool faith heads are immune to argument their resistance built up over years of childhood indoctrination using methods that took centuries to mature but i believe there are plenty of open minded people out there people whose childhood indoctrination was not too insidious or for other reasons didnt take or whose native intelligence is strong enough to overcome it
5565926 if dawkins came out and said his favorite dessert was peach pie someone out there probably jj would argue that
5565927 the sort of religion that has been around for the bulk of history at least in our culture is exactly the sort of religion that would look extremist today
5565928 i am just so tired of hearing these idiotic melodramatic deliberate misinterpretations of dawkins being trotted out day after day by the same few people for the sole purpose of making it appear as if the reason for criticizing religion is really just meanness and bigotry
5565929 the reason for criticizing religion is really just meanness and bigotry
5565930 the simple fact is that many mainstream religionists are exactly what dawkins is describing there are plenty of them in my own church i run into them every day
5565931 until then ill have a fond appreciation for reading his writing unlike some religionists i not only enjoy having my faith challenged i think its incredibly healthy
5565932 you are the evidence for it peaches didnt come out of thin air it came out of watching you assholes
5565933 i would suspect that while your own conversion was partly blocked by similar attitudes they were nonetheless tossing around in the back of your mind
5565934 pity that a person who so frequently claims to be upholding rationality cant understand why science is unexcited by the concept of miracle
5565935 let me know when you find an example of an observable phenomenon science recognizes as supernatural
5565936 while were waiting for that to happen we might want to return to the original topic whether or not trying to avoid cultural conflict with religious believers is helpful to the promulgation of science
5565937 all believe the same thing and have the same attitudes
5565938 im not so concerned about the stereotypes being aggressive is not a bad strategy at all
5565939 all believe the same thing and have the same attitudes
5565940 unfortunately that stereotype happens to be a true representation of a significant portion of the athiest community as this very forum demonstrates so im not sure stereotype is the right word
5565941 i suppose one could compare him to the raging queens who helped push gay rights out into public view a few decades ago
5565942 cant we all just get along and agree to fight the fundamentalists together
5565943 to be a scientist requires that one be an atheist
5565944 okay heres an example of duwaynes sloppy arguments i have had a lot of experiences that cannot be explained other than to attribute them to either a level of coincidence that i just cant accept or some sort of divine or extra physical intervention
5565945 i accept that the divine agency that caused those experiences may well be myself
5565946 a sloppy argument is not fixed by the mere admission that you might be wrong
5565947 the point would be stronger if youd ever correctly identified a bad argument
5565948 scientist so i can disclude people who do things i dont like or believe things i think are demonstrably fasle frankly i think the precedent is dangerous and more than a little creepy

5566001 it absolutely needs its mother or another whale to adopt it
5566002 its heart wrenching normally whales stay very very close to their mothers theyre inseparable and they suckle for 11 months before being weaned
5566003 the sad news is this morning its returned the last sighting was mackerel beach in pittwater
5566004 weve got some folks out there at the moment trying to assess its condition but the fact that it went out to sea yesterday there were whales in the vicinity but its come back in again its pretty sad news
5566005 it would suggest that its not been able to make contact with those whales or they werent interested in it

5566015 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that

5566054 it is reasonable to say that people who have never had treatment have actively avoided treatment
5566055 that does not mean that people with long term illness deny it or fail to recognize their condition the overwhelming majority of patients who rationalize their illness will when pushed admit that there is something abnormal about their thinking and their behavior
5566056 okay well im eating and my weight isnt dangerous my vitals and labs are fine i have friends and more of a life than i used to maybe i still obsess over food and worry about my weight but lots of people in the world do that
5566057 the discussion of weight gain and approaches to weight have to be very cautious and very deliberate
5566058 the goal has to be weight maintenance as opposed to weight increase the patient must be kept socially active to prevent malaise and isolation clinicians must stress that the goal of care is to stabilize the patients condition and to reassure him or her that the issue of weight gain will not be forced

5566075 obama has a personal knowledge and interest that is not insignificant
5566076 he made sure he was smart around the issues of global health

5566122 this is an extension of a technology thats been around in the server world for several years
5566123 on servers you have something thats called a service processor thats always awake and can do things like monitor the system do reboots and run diagnostics youd have complete remote access to your home pc you could do that now but the computer has to be turned on all the time and sleep mode can interfere with remote operations
5566124 this technological collaboration enables users to reduce wasted energy while still being able to conveniently access all their files even when on the go
5566125 think of when you can for instance tell your home computer to boot up email you a file at work and then turn itself off with this someday you could turn your computer on remotely turn it off remotely reboot it anything you like you also could schedule things to happen unattended

5566129 see it as a long term investment part of real estate for them is owning a piece of new york
5566130 the flatiron is expensive but with the cheap dollar it made sense to increase our share
5566131 the stability of the new york real estate market is unique this current crisis will pass and the dollar will re establish itself we are confident
5566132 this isnt just about the dollar the strongest driver is that investors are looking for geographical diversification the same situation played out on wall street about 10 to 15 years ago
5566133 european companies are very much conscious of the potential windfall you buy cheap now with the belief that in 10 years the currency will have rebounded
5566134 in terms of infrastructure the u s is an emerging market
5566135 the difference between the u s and europe is that the u s has stellar science and a rapid rate of innovation and transferring that technology to the market for commercial purposes
5566136 they could save 8 000 a car by building in the u s
5566137 the market has changed it will be a much bigger market for the kind of small car with advanced technology that the europeans are so good at making
5566138 its not just that american assets are cheaper the untold story here is that foreign investors are no longer willing to finance american debt
5566139 if you were to look at america inc as a company its like owning a company and you own a smaller and smaller fraction of it so the fraction of america inc owned by americans is diminishing

5566162 the party platform demonizes semiautomatic sport utility rifles and wants them banned calls for anti gun show legislation and proposes so called common sense gun laws many democrats believe bans on most guns are common sense and they still support the handgun ban in barack obamas hometown of chicago boiled down all it really means is that the democrats are still the party of gun control no matter how they try to re package the rhetoric and they know it
5566163 the partys gun control platform plank puts the lie to everything they say
5566164 as democrats descend on denver to nominate a candidate who is on record in opposition to sensible concealed carry laws we encourage gun owners across the country and especially in colorado to remind the party that the supreme court in june held that gun bans are unconstitutional
5566165 even after a study done for the justice department found that gun shows are rarely the source of firearms used by criminals
5566166 democrats have an opportunity to reject and repudiate this platform

5566173 that depends on the situation on a policy level that is now being subject to a very close review
5566174 what is this are they the milf toying with us theyre saying that they have no control over these people and now theyre denying that these are their people on a policy level we might have to review now because if we enter into any agreement with them and then there are people who will disrupt the peace what for is the peace agreement

5566184 bainimaramas contempt for regional leaders such as the grand chief of papua new guinea sir michael somare on this question have to be taken into account and i think its going to turn into a very interesting discussion in niue in terms of this decision not to attend
5566185 i personally intervened to ensure that transit visas were available for the fiji delegation to go through auckland airport to niue so that they could be accountable to forum leaders for commitments given last year
5566186 no doubt the forum will be in touch with the interim government of fiji afterwards to convey the views of the forum

5566210 for the active component soldier stop loss is based on skill under the guidance being drafted mobilized units can be kept indefinitely under stop loss regardless of military occupational specialty

5566313 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
5566314 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
5566315 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
5566316 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
5566317 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word

5566321 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear

5566351 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
5566352 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
5566353 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos

5566355 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e

5566362 while we offer a full range of dental services under one roof our emphasis is on more than one stop dental care
5566363 we want our patients to feel soothed and at home as though they are coming to spend time with friends
5566364 our upscale modern office is a reflection of our professional commitment to stay on the cutting edge of dentistry
5566365 our patients shouldnt have to move from specialist to specialist to get the care they need
5566366 whether patients want to come in for a quick lunch hour whitening treatment or need extensive smile makeovers were able to serve them
5566367 our core belief is that patient education and prevention are as important as treatment
5566368 we want to make our community healthy which is why we offer free consultations and examinations as well as educational videos for patients to watch during their procedures
5566369 unfortunately that misses the point if you come in every six months for a dental visit you wont reach the level where you have a problem
5566370 you go for manicures for pedicures and to get your hair done having your teeth professionally cleaned is another facet of self care that makes you feel and look your best

5566376 ja das haben wir uns sicherlich ganz anders vorgestellt ein 0 3 zur halbzeit war bestimmt nicht unser ziel
5566377 every day we see patients who have dental anxieties fears and phobias
5566378 these fears can have a devastating effect since postponements in receiving dental care can impact a persons self confidence appearance and well being left untreated dental problems can have far reaching consequences seriously affecting patient health
5566379 sedation should be the last resort not the first course of action
5566380 its a quick fix that may address the symptoms of anxiety but not the underlying cause
5566381 dental anxiety is basically the fear of the unknown and can usually be handled by taking the time to familiarize a patient with the office the equipment and the procedures
5566382 dental fear elicits more of a fight or flight response and typically can be eradicated by giving patients more control over their experience dental phobia can be more difficult to overcome but the same desensitization techniques used to treat other phobias also work nicely with dental phobia
5566383 i started by showing her all of the instruments we would be using and honestly discussing every nuance of the procedure
5566384 then she went back in the waiting room until her fear subsided she then came back in and allowed me to do an examination and then went back out to the waiting room we repeated the process over the course of several hours but ultimately she received treatment that same day with no sedation
5566385 unfortunately many people have had humiliating or negative experiences with other dentists or have picked up on a parents dental anxiety
5566386 uncovering the source of the problem enables us to develop valuable strategies that will lead to successful treatment
5566387 for some people headphones and a warm blanket will do the trick while others might need to touch the instruments
5566388 if we can eliminate the anxiety fear or phobia it will not only improve a persons dental health but their general well being

5566491 i realize we have a lot of work ahead of us and i am optimistic that with the support of management our coaching staff and the players we will move forward to positioning this team to qualify for this seasons mls playoffs my ultimate goal is to win championships and build a club that all of our fans will be proud of
5566492 bruce is the best coach for the galaxy and certainly one of the best coaches in the history of the league
5566493 i am impressed with his passion desire and focus and believe that his recent experiences with the u s national team and red bulls have prepared and motivated him for this next challenge
5566494 we have always felt that the galaxy should aspire to be the club that sets the pace and tone in major league soccer

5566514 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5566515 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5566516 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5566517 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this

5566530 this man came to do good this moment of sadness is also one of hope and glory
5566531 bob just did a great job everyone the crew did an unbelievable job and the greatest part is that we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us four years ago today i ran my first cup race for jack roush and he took a giant gamble on me all five of the cars were in the top 10 and to be a part of that again today for ford motor company for roush and for all the guys its an honor
5566532 it was a decent run for us i felt like it was way better and far better than what it was here in the spring you know we just were running up front today so that was nice to see but we just you know didnt have enough for the 99 carl edwards there at the end the 99 edwards always is strong im not sure if he sandbags halfway through or what we fought all we could as hard as we could there
5566533 we had a good aaa ford it was good on the long runs you know the race just worked out in our favor the 99 carl edwards and 18 kyle busch were probably the fastest of the field but we made an adjustment it seemed every stop and kept getting a little better if it wouldve been a 500 mile race i wouldve had something for em
5566534 it wasnt a bad run actually it probably shouldve been a little better than that we had a tough time getting the balance right ever since we showed up here were working really hard at it carl was just a little better than we were and david right there at the end on old tires was a little faster than us so well just work on it and get a little better
5566535 it was a struggle to say the least we were way off we were really good here in the spring and probably had a car fast enough to win the race but we were just really off today track position is real important if we wouldve been 15th or 16th on the last re start we probably wouldve finished somewhere back in there
5566536 we felt like we had a car capable of winning we chased the track a little bit i think everybody did we didnt chase it quite fast enough the last two stops we decided to go with two tires and go for it we over adjusted for the two tires and it was just too tight at the end to really do anything now were disappointed or at least i am
5566537 it was a great all around weekend for us we qualified third and ran ninth we were in the top 10 all day im proud of my stanley tools guys today im disappointed that we couldnt make the 1 million donation to charity the childrens miracle network i let stanley tools down with that it was a great day for everybody and im looking forward in moving on to bristol next week
5566538 it wasnt bad it was alright we had kind of a pretty good car at times and fought being really really loose for probably a pretty major portion of the race in the shorter runs we were too tight really to move up like we needed to it was an ok day though we fought back and forth and had it really good and just a little bit too tight to run fast there at the end
5566539 i dont know what to say we were terrible at first lost a lot of track position then had to work our way back from there its a struggle just didnt make the right adjustments from happy hour yesterday to the beginning of the race well keep working at it the mobil 1 dodge ran well we probably had a top 15 car but didnt get a top 15 finish
5566540 i can drive em man theyre just hard to drive like that all day i ran fifth all day and maybe better than that at some parts of the race and im a good enough driver i should have finished somewhere around there with that car its been the same old story we show up fast but we cant put a whole race together so weve got to do some homework
5566541 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory

5566547 when youre trying to wrap your brain around the costs of a college education
5566548 the college solution a guide for everyone looking for the right school at the right price
5566549 dont overlook all the other expenses that can significantly hike the costs
5566550 i found most of my instructors required the latest edition especially if they were the author or co author of the text but others would allow older editions
5566551 then go onto half com or ebay and look for a used version you could find a used version many times for 5 to 10 whereas that same used version would cost 45 to 60 in the campus bookstore make sure to do this 4 to 5 weeks in advance since it can sometimes take that long to receive your used book purchase
5566552 my advice is wait a couple of weeks to see if you really need the book because half of classes you really dont
5566553 and never buy in the bookstore get it on the internet
5566554 if its a book that wont require excessive reading check the campus library first
5566555 it may be available on reserve yeah you would have to do the work in the library but it beats paying for it
5566556 i must have 2 500 worth of required college books in my basement that have never had a page turned in them
5566557 ask your insurer if it provides insurance waivers for college students who return home temporarily
5566558 this is what i did with my own daughter my insurer provides four waivers a year for when she returns home consequently i havent had to pay auto insurance for her since she flew off to college as a freshman
5566559 strap on the walking shoes and huff it to class to save on on campus parking fees
5566560 find out if the minimum is a dollar minimum you must spend x or a meal minimum you must eat x meals
5566561 the latter can be tough to reach if youre like most students and sleep through breakfast
5566562 take your lunch and drink to class keep a little cooler in the car and save big bucks school food is very bad for you and very expensive its also quite crowded unless you eat at off times

5566568 if i had it to do over again i would phrase it differently
5566569 surely the board of directors has better things to do
5566570 they will have to keep hammering at him until he apologizes for his comments how much do you think he can take
5566571 were the specific remarks intended to offend or was the offense inadvertent
5566572 just because theyre arrogant and do anything theyre told so long as its cruel and they killed millions of jews in concentration camps and made soap out of their bodies and lampshades out of their skins is that any reason to hate their expletive guts
5566573 if its that hard to cut the growth in the budget you can see how we got to this point
5566574 we were ecstatic we were just hoping she would at least medal but if she didnt thats all she had was four years of training and yet she went to the olympics that to us is a real big deal
5566575 it is amazing jenns a sweet girl shes just not like some of the others today when shes home shes just jenn
5566576 her hair goes back in a pony tail she and her brother maybe would get into a wrestling match or something shes just herself and its one of the things we enjoy the most and she loves coming home shes a hometown girl and shell tell you that herself
5566577 mark called us and he said the only disappointment they have is they arent going to get the medals until tuesday and they said they dont have tickets for it because they expected them to get the medals after the event monday
5566578 we were very greatful that she got the silver shes worked so hard for so long i know she was hoping for the gold but i know thats going to be down the road shes happy right now and were happy for her and were always proud of her medal or no medal shes a great kid she really is
5566579 just to have mark and sue over there is great when they watch the medal ceremony and the u s flag goes up i just cant imagine the emotion that that has to be for them its so exciting
5566580 sue told terra that many people knew they were jennys parents in the stands during the competition and they were all cheering jenny on and when she won the silver medal all the people sitting around them were congratulating them and they were so happy for them sue said it was something
5566581 the community will be waiting with open arms to embrace her and show her how proud we are of her performance
5566582 now its time to re convene and welcome her home we look forward to seeing her ride down the street waving that silver medal
5566583 silver is great i cant wait to see what one of those looks like up close
5566584 as you know we went into this with the expectation of celebrating her accomplishments gold silver bronze or a miss she still is the american record holder and has made us all proud we all look forward to her homecoming celebration
5566585 in vergelijking met 2007 is er in belgi maandelijks een miljoen liter brandstof meer verkocht aan nederlandse verbruikers in juli 2008 voerde de nederlandse overheid een accijnsverhoging in waardoor de verkoop in begli steeg tot 2 twee miljoen liter de cijfers van augustus tot nu toe tonen aan dat deze trend zich voortzet
5566586 er zal dus in augustus nogmaals twee miljoen bijkomen in totaal is dat 10 miljoen liter dit hebben we berekend aan de hand van de omzet van een brandstofleverancier die een vijfde van de markt voorstelt je kan dus stellen dat er de voorbije maanden ruim 50 miljoen liter brandstof in belgi werd getankt
5566587 in ons filiaal in maasmechelen krijgen we ook meer en meer nederlandse klanten over de vloer veel vrachtwagenbestuurders maar ook autobestuurders tegenover vorig jaar mag ik spreken van een stijging van tien procent dat heeft trouwens ook te maken met roltabak die in ons land net zoals brandstof gewoon veel goedkoper is dan bij de noorderburen
5566588 ik heb me ook laten vertellen dat heel wat nederlandse transportbedrijven hun brandstof rechtstreeks bij belgische leveranciers kopen om de eigen bedrijfsciternen te vullen
5566589 nederlandse bedrijven komen inderdaad rechtstreeks bij ons grote hoeveelheden diesel kopen maar daarnaast zien we ook een stijging wat betreft de aanvragen voor tankkaarten
5566590 het is schandalig en belachelijk tegelijk de vlaamse overheid subsidieert de open universiteit vlaanderen die afstandsonderwijs organiseert maar erkent de diplomas van die open universiteit niet
5566591 dit komt in de buurt van oplichting de vlaamse overheid maakt reclame voor de open universiteit en haar opleidingen subsidieert die opleidingen en erkent dan achteraf de diplomas niet
5566592 het was onze bedoeling weer de daken op te kruipen om de sloop te verhinderen maar die kans kregen we niet of we geraakten er niet bij of er stonden al agenten op de daken klaar om ons op te pakken
5566593 de komende dagen zal het puin worden geruimd en gesorteerd nadien gaan we voort met afbreken we hebben 51 sloopvergunningen op zak daarvan zijn er 23 al uitgevoerd de rest zal stelselmatig volgen een concrete planning is er nog niet
5566594 maar we geven de strijd nog niet op ons dorp blijft bestaan
5566595 voor ik op reis vertrok had ik zon dertig euro belkrediet
5566596 toen we aangekomen waren in spanje belde mijn zus me even op mijn gsm om te horen waar we bleven omdat de bus wat vertraging had voorts hebben we de gsm niet meer gebruikt overdag lag hij op tafel omdat je het in de drukte toch niet hoort als hij rinkelt
5566597 toen we terug thuis kwamen kregen we te horen dat ons belkrediet op was maar we hebben nooit een smsje verstuurd we kunnen ze niet eens lezen laat staan er zelf schrijven op onze voicemail staat ook dat het geen zin heeft om ons een berichtje te sturen volgens de winkel is er geen technisch probleem met onze gsm en via de ombudsdienst kregen we van base te horen dat er een probleem was bij de buitenlandse operator maar wij zijn ons geld wel kwijt
5566598 volgens onze gegevens zijn de smsjes verstuurd vanaf het toestel van mevrouw haentjens
5566599 we vermoeden dat er een smsje verstuurd is vanaf haar toestel en dat het buitenlandse netwerk door een technisch probleem geen bevestiging kreeg dat het afgeleverd was en het daarom bleef doorsturen hierbij is telkens een code aangemaakt die voor deze facturatie zorgde
5566600 wij hebben daarom een rechtszaak aangespannen en de rechter heeft ons gelijk gegeven
5566601 in belgi nederland en frankrijk leeft soms de idee dat je met kuifje alles mag doen dat iedereen daarvan gebruik of misbruik kan maken maar dat is natuurlijk niet zo als je er een verbastering van maakt moet je ter verantwoording worden geroepen
5566602 we hebben meestal in antwerpen gedraaid onder meer in een bloemenwinkel de zaak van willy het is een detail dat op de werkelijkheid ge nspireerd is want wim van den begin de vader van peter die destijds revue artiest was had zon bloemenwinkel
5566603 mijn vader zong er liedjes en deed sketches als jongetje van een jaar of vijf mocht ik soms mee en had ik het voorrecht om met de souffleuse germaine in de loges van de artiesten te gaan het was een magische wereld en als kind wist ik direct wat ik later wilde doen voor de film en de reeks willen we vooral de sfeer van dit theater oproepen maar voor de rest is het fictie het verhaal gaat over het leven van de artiesten
5566604 in de jaren zeventig waren wij tieners maar oud belgi heb ik zelf niet meer gezien dit soort theater bestaat alleen nog in de zomer aan de kust in het witte paard bijvoorbeeld waar mensen als luc caals die traditie nog voortzetten
5566605 ons verhaal gaat over de teloorgang van het revuetheater ondermeer door de opkomst van de tv die voor artiesten als jack in the box en messenwerpers de doodsteek heeft betekend ik weet niet of het nu nog levensvatbaar zou zijn wij hebben onder elkaar tussen de opnamen door wel al vage plannen gesmeed om met een echte eigentijdse revue het land in te trekken maar ik weet niet of het er ooit zal van komen
5566606 al is de serie ook leuk mijn personage is een echte smeerlap een manipulator hij heeft jarenlang het mooie weer gemaakt in oud belgi en heeft een hoge eigendunk willy en marcel willen een frisse wind doen waaien en zo ontstaan er allerlei conflicten tussen ons drie n
5566607 we hadden die schaarlift die zon acht meter hoog kan uitschuiven gehuurd
5566608 we wilden er schilderwerken mee uitvoeren de man van eurorent wilde de lift van de vrachtwagen rijden hij had zich bovenop de lift gezet om die te kunnen bedienen plots raakte n van de wielen van de schaarlift klem en schoot het geheel met een kleine schok vooruit daarbij schoof n van die wielen over de rand van de vrachtwagen en kantelde heel het gevaarte ik kon zelf nog net op tijd wegspringen of ik had er zelf onder gelegen
5566609 gelukkig is de schaarlift op een stevige betonnen brievenbus terechtgekomen als die er niet stond had de man het niet overleefd die brievenbus heeft zijn leven gered zon schaarlift weegt twee ton
5566610 als iemand me straks omver rijdt klop ik hem achteraf op zijn gezicht
5566611 in de ronde van groot brittanni ben ik hem ooit te snel af geweest in een massaspurt helaas was dat maar voor de derde plaats maar toch ja een fenomeen die jongen
5566612 een leeftijdsgenoot cavendish bij de beloften heb ik vaak tegen hem gekoerst toen al kon hij dingen waarvan je achterover viel en dat zelfvertrouwen was ook al aanwezig
5566613 iedereen focust zich nu op cavendish maar wiggins d t is de man
5566614 als wiggins zijn motor aanzet rijdt hij het hele veld naar de kloten die demarreert vanop de kop
5566615 bij wijze van boutade die vent kan solo een ploegkoers rijden alleen risi doet hem dat na en ze hebben nog een hele sterke ploegmaat ook
5566616 en dan heb je nog de nederlanders de denen de australiers tsjechen de nieuw zeelanders tussen vijf en acht dat moet onze plaats worden maar die cavendish is ook een vies ventje hoor tijdens het wk puntenkoers heeft hij me nog een zware kwak gegeven als hij mij straks wil passeren wees er maar zeker van dat ik mijn ellebogen naar buiten ga zetten veel van die techniekjes heb ik geleerd van matthew gilmore de strafste van allemaal daardoor kan ik snellere mannen toch kloppen je moet wel in zon olympische finale waar er zelfs gevochten wordt voor de vijftiende plaats
5566617 daar kan ik nog wat van leren ik houd me nog te veel aan de regels keisse knikt al dat gewring
5566618 mijn cli nt had een verzoek tot beperkte detentie ingediend en werd op 7 augustus opgeroepen om te verschijnen voor de brusselse strafuitvoeringsrechtbank die zetelde in de gevangenis van leuven centraal
5566619 op 12 augustus werd zijn verzoek ingewilligd beperkte detentie houdt in dat mijn cli nt overdag de gevangenis mag verlaten om te gaan werken aan die detentie zijn ook een aantal strenge voorwaarden verbonden zo moet mijn cli nt de burgerlijke partijen blijven afbetalen mag hij geen contact onderhouden met de mededaders en mag hij niet meer actief zijn in brede sector van de vleeshandel
5566620 het is een bewuste keuze van mijn cli nt om zich stap voor stap in de maatschappij te re ntegreren
5566621 de mensen claxonneren ze vragen zich af waarom ik hier langs de weg loop
5566622 sustainable developmental initiatives are gaining importance today with dubai already having taken the lead in designing and promoting green energy efficient buildings mushrif heights is part of emaars commitment to this social responsibility and we are creating a new eco friendly community where the focus is on integrating every day living with the natural environment
5566623 away from the bustle of the city mushrif heights will set a new development dynamic for dubai as it also energizes the mushrif locality all aspects of the project are in line with emaars overall development ethos of creating integrated communities that meet all lifestyle needs of residents
5566624 for us the asian pacific region counts among the most important target markets together with europe and the american continent
5566625 the developed national economies in this region are marked by a fast growth dynamic and sound investment parameters since our market entry in 2006 we invested approximately 1 billion euros so far meanwhile we gathered a comprehensive market know how that has become the basis for our local commitments there
5566626 the balance of the first semester of 2008 is ambiguous from our perspective on the one hand we have reason to be happy with the current business trend because we have further growth to report in our core business as a property and asset management service provider on the other hand the extremely negative stock market environment in the real estate stocks segment has not spared us as we had to undertake another adjustment in the value of our interest in fair value reit ag this has meant a considerable burden on our profits for q3 and q4 we will concentrate above all on the intensification of the investment activity and on the development of fair value reit ag
5566627 savills is proud to be able to establish a long term cooperation with hna group a distinguished state owned enterprise in china

5566651 when it comes to saving lives god trumps doctors for many americans
5566652 sure the odds are pretty long but you never know
5566653 i have become more of a realist i know that none of us are immune from anything
5566654 theres no one who wanted to see a change more than me i stepped up to make a difference to get things on track and i think weve been very successful so far
5566655 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5566656 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5566657 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5566658 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5566659 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5566660 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5566661 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5566662 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5566663 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5566664 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5566665 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5566666 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5566667 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5566668 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5566669 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5566670 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5566671 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5566672 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5566673 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5566674 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5566675 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5566676 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5566677 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5566678 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5566679 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5566680 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5566681 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5566682 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5566683 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5566684 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5566685 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5566686 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5566687 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5566688 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5566689 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5566690 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5566691 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5566692 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5566693 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5566694 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5566695 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5566696 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5566697 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5566698 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5566699 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5566700 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5566701 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5566702 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5566703 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5566704 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5566705 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5566706 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

5566712 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5566713 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5566714 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5566715 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5566716 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5566717 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5566718 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5566719 wanted to see where i was at and not slow down too much
5566720 i was pretty mad but had to get over it
5566721 it was unfortunate but hey you never know what happens nowadays
5566722 i still have the scars but im happy im thankful
5566723 its a dog its ok you can get another one relax
5566724 i have another project based on the life of comedian bill hicks which is going from treatment to draft stage with kiwi writer mark staufer
5566725 if we were pitching better we wouldnt have to come up with as much offense as we have been wasting we are just not holding anybody down right now

5566740 congratulations unlike every other writer whose work ive read this year you and your wife know theres a limit to how much you can stick on a page and you know just where that limit is
5566741 we will see a lower opening but i dont really see too much of downside
5566742 the market is taking a breather after the recent upmove and needs some trigger
5566743 eu autommobile production decreases both gold and platinum continue to be bearish platinum may be below 1 200
5566744 from the charts platinum seemed to have returned the premiums from the earlier south africa crisis and in fact we are almost at one year lows i am looking at the 1 200 1 250 region for support now
5566745 general sentiment for gold remains weak and i guess we are likely to see more selling on strength for near term support i am currently looking at the 770 region
5566746 if we move below that then the 750s will be a very important level to look at
5566747 there will be a media advisory issued when the time comes and thats all that i am able to say
5566748 man kann bei den spielen nicht derart gegen die regeln versto en

5566762 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5566763 the brutal russian invasion of neighboring georgia exemplifies the worst aspects of nation state behavior
5566764 in a world filled with national regional and ethnic tensions and now overflowing with armaments thanks in no small part to u s weapons sales the path to peace and stability will not come from military action the russian invasion of georgia must be strongly condemned but no differently than the u s invasion and continuing occupation of iraq and u s threats and military action elsewhere in the middle east unless our nation turns away from our own militarized foreign policy and toward diplomacy and peaceful dispute resolution other regions of the world will continue to explode in violence and there will be nothing that the u s can do about it
5566765 the behavior that we want to promote is to protect one of our most precious natural resources so that we all are doing our part to help the environment this water conservation rate provides a financial incentive for water customers to do just that
5566766 a growing number of us are starting to feel like we could wake up one morning pick up the paper and read that hundreds of senior centers across the city are about to close
5566767 when confronted with issues of health safety and other exigent circumstances the department needs the flexibility to take immediate action
5566768 senior centers are not just another program they are an anchor for communities throughout this city
5566769 closing up even one senior center would be an absolute disaster
5566770 we have been meeting and will continue to meet with nearby schools residents as well as government and public officials to discuss potential impacts of this project
5566771 deps activities around the reservoir are not likely to have a significant impact on rats because the area there is not significantly infested
5566772 this is an area that we have looked at actively
5566773 they didnt study the prospect of blasting at the reservoir at all
5566774 i dont think they have a plan for this and if they do i dont think it will work
5566775 this will be a beautiful facility that will be efficiently run and will add to the neighborhood
5566776 people were waiting 20 hours to be processed you were stepping over sleeping bodies to fill out your application
5566777 community concerns about the old eau were warranted but the system has transformed

5566803 the patience of our soldiers in trying to uphold the primacy of the peace process is very commendable but at some point we really have to act decisively
5566804 we regret the loss of lives and property in lanao del norte but we would to emphasise that the milf leadership has not authorised these actions

5566826 id be excited about that hes going to be a power guy and getting a better feel for the strike zone is usually the last step before everything comes together

5566838 we are committed to ethical arrangements and ensuring that interactions between industry and health care providers enhance the publics health and foster public confidence unfortunately this legislation would impede important interactions with providers and could drive this critical research and development out of state
5566839 unlike other segments of the health care sector medical technology is often developed and refined based on input from physicians who have direct and constant feedback from their patients training by manufacturers to providers is often critical to the safe use of complex technology
5566840 americas medical device manufacturers believe that patients should have full confidence that the only factor influencing a physicians decision making is the best interests of the patient
5566841 in addition advameds code of ethics adopted in 2003 is tailored to the unique interactions among the medical device industry and health care professionals to preserve ethical collaborations that fuel advances in medical technology and ensure patient access to the most advanced technologies

5566850 much like menudo does or the blue man group i was going to hand the band over to this younger generation of revco s to sin quirin guitars josh bradford vocals and clayton worbeck keyboards kind of franchise it out i think that these three knuckleheads capture the true essence and spirit of being a revolting cock if you will but this album turned out so damned good i think im going to stick around for a while
5566851 as a matter of fact i think this is the best album including ministry pailhead lard anything ive ever done period production wise song wise im really really happy with this record its the first cd ive ever gotten back from the mastering studio that i didnt have anything to bitch about no complaints i listened to the whole thing and just went ok thats a wrap lets go

5566853 the acquisition of this promising program strengthens bayer schering pharma s oncology pipeline as it is complementary to existing in house approaches
5566854 the deal underpins our commitment to oncology research and our long term aspiration to provide new treatment options for patients suffering from cancer

5566856 the decision to suspend enrollment in this clinical trial is based solely on the results reported in a recently published study comparing laser treatment and intravitreal injections of ta

5566859 caveat emptor applies when buying any product online from an unknown source or a reseller like e bay or amazon it presents a real danger when buying purported cosmetic injectables the buyer has no idea if its product is genuine or safe
5566860 theres a possibility the product has been obtained illegally stored improperly or packaged incorrectly all of these things can lead to poor outcomes including disfigurement infection or in some cases even death it is in your best interest to seek out a qualified physician and not take the risk from buying online
5566861 genuine fda approved cosmetic injections in a proper medical setting administered by a board certified and properly qualified physician are vastly safe and rewarding procedures says coalition leader mark codner md of atlanta ga
5566862 counterfeit injectables and injectables that are not used properly can have devastating side effects by injecting yourself or someone you know you are not only taking on risk you are engaging in the practice of medicine without a license which in all 50 states is a criminal offense
5566863 the success of any cosmetic injection relies heavily on two very important factors your doctor and the brand of injectable
5566864 the expertise and training of your physician and the relationship you have with that physician and the proven track record of an authentic and properly prescribed and administered injectable mean the difference between a good or negative outcome

5566899 the automotive industry is now focusing on its environmental obligations to reduce co2 emissions and improve efficiencies and we are seeing the high technology capabilities of lotus engineering being in strong demand not only does our brand value of performance through light weight fit perfectly with the necessary direction of the industry to produce lighter more efficient vehicles we are also working on all aspects of future fuels investigating alternative powertrains to accommodate alcohol fuels as they enter the market
5566900 alcohols possess superior combustion characteristics to gasoline which allow greater optimisation taking full advantage of the benefits of sustainable bio alcohols will ensure a greater percentage of vehicle miles will be travelled using renewable fuels we are delighted with the investment from defra which will assist this partnership in taking forward research development and the demonstration of this environmentally conscious transport solution
5566901 we often forget how much posture affects how we look and feel as well as how it influences how people perceive us everyone is afraid of developing a pooch or beer belly but we dont realize the role poor posture can play in that
5566902 posture directly affects how tall and thin we look and how confident we appear to others but we are all so busy we hardly have time to think about it the iposture is designed to do the thinking for us
5566903 while we were working on the book i realized that improving posture requires a multi pronged approach and i wanted to create a device that could help people improve their posture as they go about their day thats when the idea for the iposture was born
5566904 a sensible diet and a targeted consistent exercise program are still important the iposture just builds upon that foundation
5566905 the land is owned by all the people of the united states and it needs to benefit all the people of the united states
5566906 we dont think this rule does that it benefits a very narrow section
5566907 where do you want the animals to live that we have pushed out of the rest of the land id just like to leave something for them
5566908 the way the rule is written pretty much allows them to go in and do fuels treatment anywhere in the backcountry
5566909 this is not what the state and the public asked for because of these exceptions
5566910 i really think we can have our cake and eat it too on the front range if were considerate of others needs
5566911 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5566912 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5566913 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5566914 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5566915 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5566916 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from mexico youd think we would want to pay more attention
5566917 i miss those days and so i pout like a grown jerk wishin all i had to do now was finish homework its true you dont realize really what you got til its gone and im not gonna sing another sad song but sometimes i do sit and reminisce then think about the years i was raised back in the days

5566925 this is a major victory for farm animals in new jersey and will pave the way for better protections of farm animals nationwide
5566926 setting a legal precedent in a unanimous vote that clarifies that commonly used practices cannot be considered humane simply because they are widely used will build on our momentum in challenging the cruel status quo on factory farms
5566927 this decision will protect thousands of animals in new jersey and also calls into question some of the worst factory farm abuses practiced throughout the country
5566928 all animals deserve humane treatment including animals raised for food
5566929 those techniques commonly taught by veterinary schools land grant colleges and agricultural extension agents for the benefit of animals the livestock industry animal handlers and the public health

5566936 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5566937 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5566938 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction

5566955 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness

5567000 and the trees are all kept equal by hatchet axe and saw
5567001 those silly capitalists they dont even understand equality they think we mean something foolish like this and they try and scare everyone with stories of how we leftists hate people who excel
5567002 the indians feel like the government is not taking any action against the teacher
5567003 however ive been told by the education minister that the transfer was made to ensure the teachers safety
5567004 i also do not want the teacher to be falsely accused i am monitoring the case carefully myself
5567005 yang kalian anggap yesus itu di dalam agama saya merupakan salah satu tokoh yang sangat dihormati salah seorang manusia utama yang dipilih allah swt untuk menjadi utusan nya alias jadi rasul dan kami menyebutnya isa as dia bukan pesakitan yang disiksa dipukuli dengan penuh kehinaan disalib dan merengek rengek mencari tuhannya
5567006 hal itu mudah bagi ku dan agar kami menjadikannya sebagai tanda kebesaran allah bagi manusia dan sebagai rahmat dari kami dan hal itu adalah suatu urusan yang sudah diputuskan
5567007 mereka itulah orang orang yang telah kami beri kitab hikmah dan kenabian
5567008 dari pihakmu engkau harus memegang perjanjian ku engkau dan keturunanmu turun temurun 9

5567011 its the radiocarbon date that to our minds is like a square peg in a round hole its not fitting properly and the question is why
5567012 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
5567013 enemys and ask that satan and the fallen angels be given redemtion as well
5567014 siapakah antara kamu yang lebih baik amalannya dia maha perkasa dalam melakukan pembalasan terhadap orang yang derhaka lagi maha pengampun bagi orang yang bertaubat
5567015 aku tak kisah selama ujian itu tidak menjejaskan iman dan agamaku
5567016 antara tanda kefahaman seorang hamba adalah dia mengetahui apakah imannya bertambah atau berkurang
5567017 katakanlah jika bapa anak saudara isteri kaum keluargamu harta kekayaan kamu usahakan perniagaan kamu khuatiri kerugiannya dan tempat tinggal kamu sukai adalah lebih kamu cintai daripada allah dan rasul nya dan dari berjihad di jalan nya maka tunggulah sampai allah mendatangkan keputusan nya dan allah tidak akan memberi petunjuk kepada orang yang fasik
5567018 dan sungguh akan kami berikan cubaan kepadamu dengan sedikit ketakutan kelaparan kekurangan harta jiwa dan buah buahan dan berikanlah berita gembira kepada orang yang sabar
5567019 dan apabila manusia ditimpa bahaya dia berdoa kepada kami dalam keadaan berbaring duduk atau berdiri tetapi setelah kami hilangkan bahaya itu daripadanya dia kembali melalui jalannya yang sesat seolah olah dia tidak pernah berdoa kepada kami untuk menghilangkan bahaya yang menimpanya begitulah orang yang melampaui batas itu memandang baik apa yang selalu mereka kerjakan
5567020 seorang muslim tidak akan sampai pada hakikat iman sehingga masa baginya lebih berharga daripada hartanya
5567021 aku memiliki jiwa yang cekal untuk mendapat segala keinginanku dulu aku ingin berkahwin dengan anak perempuan bapa saudaraku akhirnya aku memilikinya lalu aku ingin menjadi gabenor madinah aku ingin menegakkan keadilan dan aku memperolehnya kemudian aku ingin menjadi khalifah kaum muslimin dan aku mendapatkannya adapun kini aku merindukan yang lebih tinggi lagi sekarang aku merindukan syurga allah
5567022 sesungguhnya kewajipan kamu lebih banyak daripada masa yang kamu miliki
5567023 setiap hembusan nafas dan titisan peluh yang keluar di dunia tidak dalam rangka ketaatan kepada allah maka akan keluar pada hari kiamat dalam keadaan menyesal
5567024 saya melihat burung ini betapa beruntungnya ia hinggap di sebatang ranting dan memakan buahnya ia mendatangi sungai yang jernih dan meminum airnya ia mati tanpa dihisab dan tiada mendapat azab oh seandainya aku hidup seperti burung ini oh seandainya ibuku tidak melahirkanku
5567025 we must indeed all hang together or most assuredly we shall all hang separately
5567026 the old russian brutalisms with what georgia has accomplished since gaining independence
5567027 i believe that everything happens for a reason people change so that you can learn to let go things go wrong so that you can appreciate them when theyre right you believe lies so that you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself and good things fall apart so better things can fall together
5567028 the assignment i have received today is a great responsibility
5567029 in the maya tradition these are the carriers of time i am at your service i am following in the steps of my ancestors without violence without hatred without intrigue because valiant men deal with dialogue while cowardly mean deal with weapons what we need now without distinction of race color or creed is to understand that we are all humans and we have the same needs and the same feelings i ask of you ministers of state lets forget about racism lets walk together we are beings of equal value
5567030 i have had the honor to meet many of the indigenous elders who are here today
5567031 we have shared many things in the past 14 years it is this connection with them walking at their side learning from them has transformed my life it transformed me so much that it has made me president today
5567032 the mayan worldview isnt about the number of indigenous posts or the number of native
5567033 dont ask what the world needs ask what makes you come alive and go do it because what the world needs is people who have come alive
5567034 well go to corporate later today lets wait for the rain
5567035 are you fucking around with me this shit doesnt cost half as that
5567036 the food market has gone down everything is out of proportion
5567037 am i really here how did i get back to viet nam to ha noi
5567038 this is going to be a different year even a difficult one
5567039 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5567040 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5567041 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5567042 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5567043 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5567044 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5567045 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5567046 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5567047 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5567048 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5567049 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5567050 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5567051 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5567052 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5567053 proses selanjutnya akan sangat tergantung kepada hasil penilaian dalam due diligence tersebut dan semua proses akuisisi akan dilakukan dengan mengikuti peraturan serta ketentuan yang berlaku
5567054 would not subsidize bells and whistles marriage counseling acupuncture etc as the current system does
5567055 basically i would be forced to choose between paying the increased taxes on the company paid premium or pay at least 4 000 out of pocket per year for private insurance after adjusting for the value of the tax credit
5567056 anyone with good insurance is not going to find this acceptable
5567057 candidates should appeal to the voters based on their qualifications for office and their stands on the issues not their religious beliefs
5567058 i could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says i dont need god
5567059 theyre saying im totally self sufficient by myself and nobody is self sufficient to be president by themselves its too big a job
5567060 guys hooking up with this guy isnt really supporting democracy
5567061 you know if he stole power once he might just do it again and again
5567062 im excited for my surgery so the pain will stop
5567063 just pray and maybe if you sleep you wont feel the pain
5567064 let me get this right you start running and lose a bit of weight then you stop losing weight because your body has gotten used to that exercise so to lose more weight you have to either run more for which you dont have the time or do a different higher intensity workout and you have to keep doing this i think ill stick to my sedentary lifestyle thank you very much i mean if im still not going to lose all that much weight why work out at all

5567071 a developer who does not understand the kernel communitys ways or worse who tries to flout or circumvent them will have a frustrating experience in store
5567072 much developer frustration comes from a lack of understanding of this process or from attempts to circumvent it
5567073 the bigger and more important the project the more likely it is to have a number of levels
5567074 enterprise class projects including the linux kernel have more processes but that shows how seriously they take the project its less difficult to get code into a project if you understand the rules
5567075 erst wurde uns der bahn bergang genommen und sozusagen eine mauer durch genthin gezogen jetzt soll auch noch henkel verschwinden
5567076 ahora pues a causa del convenio que hab is hecho ser is llamados progenie de cristo hijos e hijas de l vuestros corazones han cambiado por causa de la fe en su nombre
5567077 por que somos sepultados juntamente con l para muerte por el bautismo a fin de que como cristo resucito de los muertos por la gloria del padre as tambi n nosotros andemos en vida nueva

5567083 human exploration beyond low earth orbit should be a long term goal and investment for all space faring countries with america in the lead
5567084 human spaceflight is important to americas political economic technological and scientific leadership
5567085 barack obama endorses the goal of sending human missions to the moon by 2020 as a precursor in an orderly progression to missions to more distant destinations including mars
5567086 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5567087 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as is the case of sen obama
5567088 let me just say in case sen obama does decide to return to his original plan of cutting nasa funding i oppose such cuts
5567089 o benef cio concedido a vilma o mesmo dado a qualquer outro reeducando que tenha cumprido um ter o da pena e que tenha comportamento aprov vel

5567093 bukan dari golongan kami mereka yang tidak menyayangi anak anak kami tidak menghargai orang tua kami tidak menyerukan kemakrufan dan tidak pula mencegah kemungkaran

5567095 kami sekarang ini menunggu saja jika ada yang lapor baru kami bertindak kalau ada penjualan miras di suatu tempat tapi didukung oleh warganya tidak akan kami serang

5567098 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5567099 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5567100 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5567101 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5567102 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5567103 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5567104 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5567105 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5567106 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5567107 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5567108 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5567109 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5567110 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5567111 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5567112 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5567113 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5567114 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5567115 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5567116 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5567117 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5567118 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5567119 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5567120 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5567121 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5567122 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5567123 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5567124 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5567125 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5567126 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5567127 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5567128 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5567129 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5567130 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5567131 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5567132 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5567133 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5567134 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5567135 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5567136 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5567137 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5567138 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5567139 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5567140 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5567141 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5567142 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5567143 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5567144 al momento de leer mi carta debes tener quince a os y un coraz n fuerte latiendo en tu pecho esa fue la promesa de los m dicos que te operaron
5567145 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5567146 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5567147 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5567148 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5567149 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5567150 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5567151 this is a planning took where all things are going
5567152 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5567153 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5567154 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5567155 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5567156 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5567157 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5567158 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5567159 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5567160 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5567161 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5567162 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5567163 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5567164 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5567165 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5567166 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5567167 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5567168 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5567169 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5567170 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5567171 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5567172 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5567173 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5567174 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5567175 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5567176 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5567177 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5567178 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5567179 we successfully lured the calf about a kilometre out to sea probably the first time thats been done using a yacht as a surrogate mother
5567180 later we saw whales a bit further offshore and there was a slender chance it may have linked up with them but this morning we have got reports that it has returned to the western shores of pittwater
5567181 weve consistently said it was a slim chance that it might link up with its mother or other whales but the reality is that in the wild for various reasons mothers sometimes reject their young
5567182 looking at its behaviour the way it was nuzzling up to yachts would indicate it was primarily still suckling
5567183 it really was trying to suckle just below the waterline and against the keel with its head engaged against the boat
5567184 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5567185 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5567186 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5567187 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5567188 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5567189 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5567190 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5567191 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5567192 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5567193 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5567194 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5567195 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5567196 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5567197 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5567198 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5567199 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5567200 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5567201 here was their mad dream phase one the occupation of manchuria for raw materials phase two the absorption of china for manpower phase three a triumphant sweep to the south to seize the riches of the indies phase four the eastward move to crush the united states
5567202 what you do not want done to yourself do not do to others
5567203 better is open rebuke than hidden love wounds from a friend can be trusted but an enemy multiplies kisses
5567204 you shall not covet your neighbors house you shall not covet your neighbors wife or his manservants or maidservants his oxen or donkey or in todays terms vehicles or anything that belongs to your neighbor
5567205 you have heard that it was said do not commit adultery but i tell that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his own heart
5567206 you shall not have no other gods before me you shall not make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below you shall not bow down to them or worship them or spend excessive amount of time with people or things more than god above god for i the lord your god is a jealous god punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments
5567207 the lord is my shepherd i shall not be in want he makes me to lie down in green pastures he leads me beside the still waters he restores my soul he leads me in the paths of righteousness for his name sake
5567208 anyone then who knows the good he ought to do and doesnt do it sins
5567209 for whoever keeps the law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it
5567210 now we know that whatever the law says it says to those who are under the law so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole the world held accountable to god therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law rather through the law we become conscious of sin
5567211 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life
5567212 i tell you the truth the man who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate but climbs in by some other way is a thief and a robber
5567213 i tell you the truth i am the gate for the sheep all who ever came before me were thieves and robbers but the sheep did not listen to them i am the gate whoever enters through me will be saved he will come in and go out and find pasture the thief comes only to steal kill and destroy i have come that they those who believes in jesus as the son of god may have life and have it to the full
5567214 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
5567215 i tell you the truth the man who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate but climbs in by some other way is a thief and a robber
5567216 i tell you the truth i am the gate for the sheep all who ever came before me were thieves and robbers but the sheep did not listen to them i am the gate whoever enters through me will be saved he will come in and go out and find pasture the thief comes only to steal kill and destroy i have come that they those who believes in jesus as the son of god may have life and have it to the full
5567217 then jesus went through the town and villages teaching as he made his way to jerusalem someone asked him lord are only a few people going to be saved he said to them make every effort to enter through the narrow door because many i tell you will try to enter and will not be able to why the standards of god no one live by for very long all falls short of gods standards without christs help no can live by his standards which is righteous living no sin will ever enter the kingdom of heaven once the owner that is the father god almighty of the house house is referring to heaven gets up and closes the door you will stand outside knocking and pleading sir open the door for us but he will answer i dont know you or where you come from then you will say we ate and drank with you and you taught in our streets but he will reply i dont know you or where you come from away from me all you evildoers there will be weeping there and gnashing of teeth when you see abraham isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god but you yourselves thrown out people will come from the east and west and north and south and will take their place at the feast in the kingdom of god indeed there are those who are last who will be first and the first shall be last
5567218 jesus answered i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me if you really knew me you would know my father as well
5567219 do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of god do not be deceived neither the sexually immoral this includes also the rapists the pedophiles of all sexual immorality period nor idolaters sexual immorality is idolatry for it is the worship of the flesh and anything that is placed above god as first priority above god is idolatry period nor adulterers nor male prostitutes or any prostitutes both male and female in the new king james version of the holy bible translates homosexual offenders as sodomites which is referring to those who practice sodomy i believe both homosexuals bi sexuals transgender as well as heterosexual peoples as well as the rapists the pedophiles of all types of preferences who practices sodomy is included in this passage of scripture nor thieves nor the greedy nor the drunkards nor slanderers people who defame anothers character nor swindlers people who defraud and trick others out of their money property and basically any other material possessions will inherit the kingdom of god
5567220 for of this you can be sure no immoral impure or greedy person such a man is an idolater has any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god let no one deceive you with empty words for because of such things gods wrath comes on those who are disobedient therefore do not be partners with them
5567221 he who overcomes will inherit all this all this what the kingdom of god and the new earth that is promised in revelation 21 1 6 and i will be there god and he will be my son but the cowardly the unbelieving the vile the murderers the sexually immoral those who practice magic arts the idolaters and all liars their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur this is the second death
5567222 for a man is a slave to whatever has mastered him if they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our lord and savior jesus christ and are again entangled in it and overcome they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning talking about sin it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them of them the proverbs are true a dog returns to its vomit and a sow or pig that is washed goes back to her wallowing in the mud
5567223 who ever believes in him that is the lord jesus christ is not condemned but who ever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of gods one and only son
5567224 to this john replied a man can receive only what is given him from heaven you yourselves can testify that i said i am not the christ but i am sent ahead of him the bride the believers and followers of jesus the christ belongs to the bridegroom jesus the christ himself the friend referring to himself for john the baptist is the friend of jesus the christ on this earth at that time so this also proves who john was referring to who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him and is full of joy when he hears the bridegrooms voice that joy is mine and it is now complete why jesus the christ is now in the world coming to save the sinners he must become greater i must become less the one who comes from above is above all the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks as one from the earth the one who comes from heaven is above all he testifies to what he has seen and hears but no one accepts his testimony the man that has accepted it has certified that god is truthful for no one whom god has sent speaks the words of god for god gives the spirit without limit the father loves the son and has placed everything in his hands whoever believes in the son has eternal life but whoever rejects the son will not see life for gods wrath remain on him
5567225 lay hold of my words with all your heart keep my commands and you will live get wisdom get understanding do not forget my words or swerve from them do not forsake wisdom and she will protect you save you love her and she will watch over you wisdom is supreme therefore get wisdom though it cost all you have get understanding esteem her and she will exalt you embrace her and she will honor you she will set a garland of grace on your head and present you with a crown of splendor
5567226 the lord brought me forth as the first of his works
5567227 now then my sons listen to me blessed are those who keep my ways listen to my instruction and be wise do not ignore it blessed is the man who listens to me watching daily at my doors waiting at my doorway for whoever finds me finds life referring to jesus the christ the son of god and receives favor from the lord but whoever fails to find me harms himself all who hate me love death
5567228 for the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but to us who are being saved it is the power of god for it is written
5567229 i will destroy the wisdom of the wise the intelligence of the intelligent i will frustrate
5567230 that if you confess with your mouth jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised jesus from the dead you will be saved for it is with your heart that you believe and are justified and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved as the scriptures
5567231 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and to purify us from all unrighteousness
5567232 lord how many times shall i forgive my brother when he sins against me up to seven time
5567233 therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants as he began to settle a man who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him since he was not able to pay the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt the servant fell on his knees before him be patient with me he begged and i will pay back everything the servants master took pity on him canceled the debt and let him go but when the servant went out he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denari he grabbed him and began to chock him pay back what you owe me he demanded his fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him be patient with me and i will pay you back but he refused instead he went off and had them thrown into prison until he could pay the debt when the other servant saw what had happened they were greatly distressed and went and told their master everything that had happened then the master called the servant in you wicked servant he said i canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to shouldnt you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as i had on you in anger turned him over to the jailers to be tortured until he should pay back all he owed this is how my heavenly father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart un forgiveness can also lead to retaliation or vengeance and vengeance can lead to murder have you murdered this may seem to be a silly question to ask but youll be surprised what god considers to be murder as it is written anyone who hates his brother or sister who is a fellow believer in the lord jesus the christ is a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life in him
5567234 you have heard that it was said to the people long ago do not murder and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment but i tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother or sister who is a fellow believer in the lord jesus the christ will be subject to judgment again anyone who says to his brother or sister who is a fellow believer in the lord jesus the christ raca is answerable to the sanhedrin but anyone who says you fool will be in danger of the fire of hell
5567235 anyone who speaks a word against the son of man
5567236 blessed are the merciful for they will be shown mercy
5567237 furthermore since they did not think it worth while to retain the knowledge of god he gave them over to a deprived mind to do what ought not to be done they become filled with all kinds of wickedness evil greed and depravity they are full of envy which leads eventually to murder strife deciet and malice
5567238 there was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day at his gate laid a beggar named lazarus covered with sores and longing to eat what fell from the rich mans table even the dogs came and licked his sores the time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to abrahams side the rich man also died and was buried in hell where he was in torment he looked up and saw abraham far away with lazarus by his side so he called to him father abraham have pity on me and send lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue because i am in agony in this fire but abraham replied son remember that in your lifetime you received your good things while lazarus received bad things but now he is comforted here and you are in agony and besides all this between us and you a great chasm has been fixed so that those who want to go from here to you cannot nor can anyone cross over from here to us he answered then i beg you father send lazarus to my fathers house for i have five brothers let him warn them so that they will not also come to this place of torment abraham replied they have moses and the prophets let them listen to them no father abraham he said but if someone from the dead goes to them they will repent he said to him if they do not listen to moses and the prophets they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead
5567239 everyone who believes that jesus is the christ the son of god is born of god and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well this is how we know that we love the children of god by loving god and carrying out his commandments this is love for god to obey his commandments and his commandments are not burdensome for everyone born of god overcomes the world this is the victory that has overcome the world even our faith who is it that overcomes the world its loose desires of the flesh only he who believes that jesus is the son of god
5567240 rabbi we know you are a teacher who has come from god for no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if god were not with him
5567241 i tell you the truth no one can see the kingdom of god unless he is born again
5567242 how can a man be born when he is old
5567243 surely he cannot enter a second time into his mothers womb to be born
5567244 i tell you the truth no one can enter the kingdom of god unless he is born of water and the spirit flesh gives birth to flesh but the spirit gives birth to spirit you should not be surprised at my saying you must be born again the wind blows wherever it pleases you hear its sound but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going so it is with everyone born of the spirit
5567245 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him whoever believes in him is not condemned but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of gods one and only son this is the verdict light has come into the world but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil everyone who does evil hates the light and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed but whoever lives by the truth comes into the light so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through god
5567246 after this jesus and his disciples went out into the judean countryside where he spent some time with them and baptized
5567247 rabbi that man who was with you on the other side of the jordan the one you testified about well he is baptizing and everyone is going to him
5567248 a man can receive only what is given him from heaven
5567249 the one who comes from above is above all the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks as one from the earth the one who comes from heaven is above all he testifies to what he has seen and heard but no one accepts his testimony the man who has accepted it has certified that god is truthful for the one whom god has sent speaks the words of god for god gives the spirit without limit the father loves the son and has placed everything in his hands whoever believes in the son has eternal life but whoever rejects the son will not see life for gods wrath remains on him
5567250 and this is love that we walk in obedience to his commands as you have heard from the beginning his command is that you walk in love

5567253 grunds tzlich stellt sich die frage ob man tats chlich so viele insekten f r ein gesundes kosystem braucht die antwort die wird gefunden haben macht es deutlich
5567254 zwar m gen die verschiedenen arten einer gruppe in einem kosystem scheinbar dieselbe funktion erf llen tats chlich reagieren sie aber in ihrem verhalten ganz unterschiedlich auf die so vielf ltigen umweltbedingungen
5567255 die nat rlicherweise vorkommende lebensraum heterogenit t ist eine entscheidende voraussetzung daf r dass die biodiversit t an bedeutung gewinnt so ist der komplement re effekt der verschiedenen arten dann am gr ten wenn auch die ressourcen in raum und zeit unterschiedlich verteilt sind
5567256 am ersten tag der olympischen spiele hielt sich die zahl der anfragen f r werbe und marketingauftritte noch sehr in grenzen
5567257 seit diesem wochenende erhalten wir rund 50 anfragen pro tag
5567258 ich mache das nun schon eine ganze weile aber mit dem was hier passiert habe ich ganz sicher nicht gerechnet
5567259 dieser wert k nnte sich nun aber zumindest kurzfristig verdoppeln
5567260 das interesse das ein sportler f r marketingzwecke hervorruft h ngt von mehreren aspekten ab
5567261 aber auch der stellenwert den eine spezifische sportart in einem bestimmten land inne hat ist in diesem zusammenhang ausschlaggebend
5567262 entscheidend ist auch wie oft ein sportler in der ffentlichkeit auftaucht im bereich des schwimmsports ist eine vermarktung deshalb schwieriger da nur zwei drei gro ereignisse pro jahr stattfinden
5567263 all diese faktoren ergeben den mehrwert eines sportler der festlegt wie interessant er im endeffekt f r das marketing von unternehmen ist
5567264 wer blu ray haben will soll blu ray kaufen unsere technologie dient dazu die wiedergabe von standard dvds zu verbessern
5567265 dass es beim thema green procurement teilweise noch erheblichen nachholbedarf in vielen unternehmen gibt ist nicht nur auf deutschland begrenzt sondern berall in der industrie der fall wichtig ist vor allem dass das umdenken des einkaufs in hinblick auf die einhaltung kologischer und ethischer standards bei den unternehmen von oben dem top management erfolgt
5567266 obwohl noch ein gro er nachholbedarf besteht kologisch sinnvoll einzukaufen bessert sich die lage so stellen viele unternehmen vermehrt fest dass der preis einer ware oder dienstleistung in zunehmenden ma durch kologische faktoren beeinflusst wird

5567270 it became obvious that google was the place where i could have the biggest impact for guys like me who have a love affair with software being able to ship a product in weeks thats an irresistible draw

5567280 we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money

5567295 youll have almost 100 percent coverage of the entire bay
5567296 certainly some aspects of the technology are troubling if people are being spied on if these cameras have that ability
5567297 in many respects its very similar to the issues that arise with surveillance cameras on land the issues are pretty much the same how much detail do the cameras provide can you zoom in with much detail are there policies in place on how you can get access to the information how long the information is kept for
5567298 some people may have an issue with the big brother thing but its certainly not about that
5567299 they all went in the drink and the cameras were right there watching it the watch standard at dem saw it all because the cameras saw it and she immediately contacted the coast guard

5567301 in warrior epic you cannot purchase power or progress the best gear and items can only be obtained by playing the game there is also no exchange of earned items with paid items so anything that a user buys with real cash cannot be obtained with in game currency
5567302 each mission in warrior epic is designed to be roughly 15 minutes long and the number of these buffs you can carry is limited so they will not unbalance the play

5567308 it absolutely needs its mother or another whale to adopt it
5567309 its heart wrenching normally whales stay very very close to their mothers theyre inseparable and they suckle for 11 months before being weaned
5567310 the sad news is this morning its returned the last sighting was mackerel beach in pittwater
5567311 weve got some folks out there at the moment trying to assess its condition but the fact that it went out to sea yesterday there were whales in the vicinity but its come back in again its pretty sad news
5567312 it would suggest that its not been able to make contact with those whales or they werent interested in it
5567313 its probably a question of days rather than weeks its a very grim prognosis
5567314 that he was struck by the paradox that while labor leaders individually were often mediocre and selfish labor as a body generally took enlightened positions on the great issues while businessmen were often enlightened as individuals but invariably took hopeless positions on public issues
5567315 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5567316 could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
5567317 the difference in this race is that john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end
5567318 sometimes it is difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5567319 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as in the case of sen obama
5567320 the old john mccain wouldnt have allowed one of jack abramoffs top cronies to raise money for him
5567321 the war within a secret white house history 2006 2008
5567322 there has not been such an authoritative and intimate account of presidential decision making since the nixon tapes and the pentagon papers
5567323 this is the declassification of what went on in secret behind the scenes
5567324 takes readers deep inside the white house the pentagon the state department the intelligence agencies and the u s military headquarters in iraq
5567325 based on extensive interviews with participants contemporaneous notes and secret documents the book traces the internal debates tensions and critical turning points in the iraq war during an extraordinary two year period
5567326 especially when children are young our job as a parent is to be there for them and as best we can nurture them and protect them so that they are free to experience the innocence and genius of childhood
5567327 children embody what is best in life they live in the present moment they are part of the exquisite bloom
5567328 we certainly expect theyll keep up their fight against terrorists and extremists
5567329 its not only a threat to the united states western europe and the whole free world but its a threat to pakistan as well
5567330 we are committed to fight against those extremists and terrorists who are destroying and making the world not safe
5567331 whats very troubling for the americans is most pakistanis think that the war on terror is not their war its our war
5567332 a step toward moving pakistan on to a more stable political footing
5567333 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5567334 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5567335 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5567336 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5567337 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5567338 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5567339 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5567340 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5567341 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5567342 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5567343 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5567344 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5567345 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5567346 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5567347 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5567348 you know long waits for health care and some services not even available
5567349 whoever the next president is health care should be at the top of his agenda bring everyone to the table and make it happen
5567350 he wanted to give them an idea of where he wanted to go with this
5567351 there was no whirring glass bubble like maxwell smart or something like that he was speaking to the integrity of the arrangement
5567352 he literally disabled it even if someone tried to turn it on it wouldnt work
5567353 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5567354 there is not one shred of evidence that its true
5567355 we are extremely disappointed to see that the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut

5567372 it was very painful the fact that you have someone telling you they will not help you because of who you are that they will deny your right to be a mother and have a family
5567373 it was clear and emphatic that discrimination has no place in doctors offices
5567374 the supreme courts desire to promote the homosexual lifestyle at the risk of infringing upon the first amendment right to free exercise of religion is what the public needs to learn about
5567375 this case will have a direct impact and cause people and look very favorably at proposition 8
5567376 the outlook is not good but we are giving the calf its only option it cant be fed and in fact we wouldnt know what to feed it
5567377 if they dont ask for what they need how can we even know what it is it sounds to me as though they must be coping perfectly fine if they arent calling us or asking for more prayer they have their faith and that should be enough during the dark moments to carry them through
5567378 if we provided transportation such as a van ride would it increase your ability to attend church if you were too ill to attend church would you listen to the service on the internet do you know who to call at the church if you occasionally need personal assistance especially when the illness is chronic and not acute are you able to see the worship song lyrics on the overhead or would having them available on paper also be helpful please rate the comfort level of our seats

5567469 but it does mean that a rape victim who was drunk deserves less sympathy simple isnt it you can hate rape and want it punished while still recognising that a woman who say goes back to a mans home after several bacardi breezers was being a bit dim
5567470 a wave of hysterical ultra feminist propaganda has this week forced a state agency to reverse a perfectly sensible decision to cut compensation to rape victims who were drunk
5567471 britain which already has one of the lowest rape conviction rates in the industrialized world
5567472 its adding to the brewing controversy and frustration of the athletes and the viewers

5567483 from my standpoint to me its kind of stressful ive never been introduced to hard work and this much pain
5567484 i just got to get the stance back right and get my footwork right
5567485 they really want me to use my quickness and strength on that side
5567486 i dont know if its solidified but hes spending more time at left than right now
5567487 ive been all up in his ear asking him for all type of advice
5567488 of course it is because i cant compete right now but ill come back wednesday working hard

5567507 this is a big to do at the moment but in a few weeks people will have forgotten what the issue was all about its because users expect more from apple there are many more users saying their iphones work than not
5567508 weve got the new firmware up and running and its true those bugs have been fixed

5567516 there is one thing we do on earth that we will continue to do in heaven that is to praise and worship god that is why we view life on earth for those who live jesus as choir practise for heaven to say that praise and worship is the most important category of music is an understatement in light of that fact there is no more important activity of the human heart that to praise and worship god
5567517 were looking at all those details what happened what was reported what was observed and who were the people that were involved
5567518 i cant imagine any officer acting appropriately after having witnessed an assault and leaving the scene
5567519 if we do have that type of supervisor or officer in our police force they should no longer be police officers
5567520 the one thing i knew i had to do was stay focused stay calm stay relaxed but i wasnt i was too excited man i wanted to spin my wheels i wanted to give everything i got out there and as a consequence i really didnt do what i wanted to do
5567521 instead of using the water i tried to power against it so every time i tried to move forward i was apparently going side by side only because the waves out there
5567522 i wasnt using it to my advantage and so as far as that race goes oh man definitely a lesson learned
5567523 i dont think that even if i did know that it would have made a difference because i let the outside forces beat me
5567524 i was excited to race him we went to the boot camp together we did the whole nine yards and we raced in the end
5567525 it was a too close to call kind of thing and i was looking forward to it but massive props to him he got the bragging rights this time
5567526 a lot of times in his case when hes not reaching i think hes just a little nervous and i could see it and i was trying to yell at him but he didnt hear me because once you start reaching it kind of calms you that happens with outrigger once you get flustered you think back on the technique i think this was a good warm up for him for the 500 and were ready

5567534 this team wants to reclaim what we could have gotten
5567535 one of the most amazing things with our team is we dont have that big name player
5567536 that abby wambach that mia hamm that julie foudy people dont really know us
5567537 i think the one thing that we took from that is that its impossible to win a championship if were not on the same page
5567538 it would be arrogant for me to ignore it and say lets move on

5567554 the asia pacific consulting marketplace 2008 2011 key trends profiles and forecasts
5567555 even in 2005 interest in the apac region was driven primarily by opportunistic servicing of growing domestic consulting demand in each market and the wish to support global clients in their endeavors in asia pacific
5567556 today a much larger group of firms has moved toward an overall strategic interest in the apac region such interest is unsurprising for the it consulting space since offshore outsourcing links have already been playing an important role in that area more surprising is how strategic interest is very quickly coming to play across the whole consulting landscape

5567561 the juror who stays out has a different opinion to the majority is often doing it for fairly rational reasons
5567562 its not the sort of irrational stupid juror which maybe the stereotype presents
5567563 theres a greater risk of a wrongful conviction if you have a chance of someone being convicted by an 11 to one vote than there is on a 12 nil vote
5567564 we say how can a verdict possibly be beyond reasonable doubt if one juror simply doesnt agree
5567565 we say that majority verdicts arent healthy and they just encourage compromise
5567566 thats not a proper way to run a jury system
5567567 it does in fact bring us in line with the rest of australia
5567568 these amendments were considered by cabinet in the context of recent debate about jury trials
5567569 thereve been a couple of cases where this issue has been the subject of public debate cabinet is part of that debate but these amendments have not been designed with any particular trial in mind
5567570 in controversial trials the only way to deal with recent problems is to allow questioning of jurors
5567571 we support judge only trials subject to seeing the fine print
5567572 but if the judge only trial is being brought in to deal with recent incidents of controversial figures and media excessive publicity we reject it for that reason
5567573 as long as the proposed legislation is confined to exceptional cases so that theres as little erosion of the role of juries as possible it could achieve a worthwhile goal to avoid having to make a choice between running the risk of a person not receiving a fair trial and losing the important opportunity of having serious criminal charges determined
5567574 we need to make sure that the detail is correct and that there wont be any surprises in there

5567632 so much black history and so much american history thats come out of the great city of pittsburgh
5567633 never before has this much black history been assembled in one place
5567634 it gives the chance for all of america to see what the contributions of african americans have been to this country
5567635 three four and even five generations after their yiddish speaking ancestors immigrated to the u
5567636 we sent the survey to 600 people and asked them to disseminate it to friends and family
5567637 we do not plan to make any grand claims about all jews or all north americans only about correlations among subgroups
5567638 if a lot of non jews use a word its just part of american speech
5567639 most are along the lines of very interesting survey but a lot are personal anecdotes about how they learned certain words family immigration history or personal engagement in jewish life there was clearly a desire to discuss ones jewish journey
5567640 we didnt think everyone would want to spend two hours taking a survey
5567641 and we didnt use some words like shiksa or shagitz non jewish woman or man because we didnt want to offend people
5567642 our hypothesis is that jews from other parts of the country will have new york influences in their speech even if theyve never lived there
5567643 in the future everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes
5567644 changes the opinion that asian countries dont get good results in sprint races i want to prove to all the world that asians can run very fast
5567645 and considering the physiology of the chinese people it is something unbelievable
5567646 a 110m hurdles race without liu is such a pity
5567647 i really wanted to be just next to lius lane because hes such a big champion its a great pity i lost an occasion to race with him i hope he will come back soon
5567648 after the athens olympics the only target of liu was to defend his title he has worked very hard for achieving this goal
5567649 was old but controlled very well thats the reason why liu performed very well in competitions in the past years
5567650 he has strong mentality and has never given up in any case
5567651 liu was very very upset about the result liu said he would never give up as long as he can run
5567652 this is the type of thing that makes nike a leader in sports marketing
5567653 how do we spend on this and turn it into a great human moment that appeals to people
5567654 hes an icon here in china he has a very bright future
5567655 if anybody takes a hit from it its certainly nike simply because theyre all about performance whereas the others are about brand image
5567656 nikes all about you dont win silver you lose gold with that attitude its much tougher for them because he was certainly the cornerstone for their program
5567657 liu xiang is an icon and that icon did not come through
5567658 for one man to carry the burden of a nation from a brand perspective was never a smart thing to do
5567659 if anybody takes a hit from it its certainly nike simply because theyre all about performance whereas the others are about brand image
5567660 nikes all about you dont win silver you lose gold with that attitude its much tougher for them because he was certainly the cornerstone for their program
5567661 we started supporting him in 2003 and well continue to support him this wont change anything
5567662 this is extraordinarily disappointing for liu xiang we have great sympathy for him and wish him a speedy recovery nothing will ever take away his performance in athens he will always remain a great chinese icon and a friend of visa
5567663 liu xiangs dropping out aroused wide sympathy it was quite moving
5567664 i think the public will understand him and respect him so in this sense his sponsors wont stop his advertisement campaigns nike coca cola these big brands must be smart enough to hold him for at least several months because liu xiangs commercial value is still there he is presenting the image of the great hero who sacrifices himself for the nation
5567665 sometimes i kind of like making my sister cry it makes me feel better about myself
5567666 thats a little disturbing we should talk more about that
5567667 maybe this will open some eyes and let people know we can win medals in the throws
5567668 help us support us seriously sometimes were the forgotten group the women throwers but weve been doing awesome
5567669 with the womens discus youve got to go all the way back to 1984 when we won a medal
5567670 just give us the love support and the respect of our fellow olympic athletes thats all theres a lot of potential in this group
5567671 i had a mary lou retton leotard that i wore around all the time i grew out of it quite quickly obviously by the time i was in seventh grade i was over 6 feet so i wasnt going to be a gymnast
5567672 i found my way to basketball and track in high school and i liked track more so here i am
5567673 i knew that id have to have a good a throw
5567674 and it just happened to come on the first one
5567675 you get three tries to get it down i tried thats why i leave with my head held high i tried
5567676 maybe this will open some eyes and let people know we can win medals in the throws
5567677 help us support us seriously sometimes were the forgotten group the women throwers but weve been doing awesome
5567678 with the womens discus youve got to go all the way back to 1984 when we won a medal
5567679 just give us the love support and the respect of our fellow olympic athletes thats all theres a lot of potential in this group
5567680 i had a mary lou retton leotard that i wore around all the time i grew out of it quite quickly obviously by the time i was in seventh grade i was over 6 feet so i wasnt going to be a gymnast
5567681 i found my way to basketball and track in high school and i liked track more so here i am
5567682 i knew that id have to have a good a throw
5567683 and it just happened to come on the first one
5567684 you get three tries to get it down i tried thats why i leave with my head held high i tried
5567685 you all know we have bent as far backward as possible to give peace a chance
5567686 the patience of our soldiers in trying to uphold the primacy of the peace process is very commendable but at some point we really have to act decisively
5567687 we regret the loss of lives and property in lanao del norte but we would to emphasise that the milf leadership has not authorised these actions
5567688 if they cant control them the government will certainly control them and we will undertake our mandate to protect the people and the communities and we cannot renege on that constitutional mandate
5567689 we will pursue and take aggressive action against the perpetrators of the dastardly acts committed against innocent civilians
5567690 generally a policy of the campaign nationally to charge a nominal fee for lawn signs
5567691 an occasional exception might be made for an outstanding volunteer
5567692 if someone balks at paying for a lawn sign and really wants one well work something out
5567693 toward evidence based medical statistics 1 the p value fallacy
5567694 the 5 280 mark is an obvious one all over the city
5567695 so i suspect it arose from discussions of how much we liked the broncos historic listing of the altitude at mile high stadium to remind the visiting players what theyre dealing with we went with the purple seats they sort of jump out at you it was sort of an insiders concept another way that is idiosyncratic to colorado
5567696 if you want the shade you go to section 347
5567697 they are kind of high but my boys love it
5567698 not too many people want to sit that high but you take in the scenery more than anything else and if youre that high you might as well be in the purple row
5567699 its true that we do sit here with the question put by the parties not answered
5567700 from the ioc perspective we would like to see these answered very much and we encourage as much transparency as possible on this matter
5567701 normally when a big name comes in we dont have to have the e mail
5567702 im just thankful im still able to talk to you like i am
5567703 i definitely feel i let the team down not only the team but all my friends all the people back home supporting me i used to go jogging early in the morning and people would recognize me and honk their horns at me they were all behind me and i feel those are the people i let down
5567704 what went on in this olympics its hard to say
5567705 we thought we had a chance for several guys to make it to the medal round but some of them fell to things beyond our control illness other things then we had the judging
5567706 honestly this dont make other kids want to come here or do this olympic thing at all
5567707 to come here and know youre going to get treated like that by judges whats the point
5567708 the fights that ive seen raushee warren got robbed raynell williams got robbed
5567709 you can see the judges are not on our side
5567710 i hate to put it that way but its the truth
5567711 nobody wanted to accept computer scoring including myself but its not going away
5567712 coaches didnt take the correct approach of how to beat a guy in the ring with the computer we continued to train our guys the same way and you cant win that way the professional style of boxing wont win on the international level
5567713 we think those changes are all steps in the right direction
5567714 we supported the idea of a full time residency program in colorado springs
5567715 we invested in it with them we thought it was the right approach to prepare for beijing like usa boxing were disappointed given all they invested in getting ready for these games
5567716 while not every circumstance out of colorado has been the way we would have wanted it
5567717 id say that the majority of our team really believes they were best prepared to give their best here as a result of the program they have been a part of
5567718 if were going to be there for a whole year why not have our coaches come up there for a month or send us home for a month or two to train with our personal coaches
5567719 i was like we need some of our personal coaches to be on the same track as the head coaches
5567720 at first we were kind of cool then everything started falling downhill
5567721 it was like coach dan whats up some people felt like they were being treated like kids thats when little boys get mad and start acting up
5567722 its good theyre able to take them away but i think they should allow personal coaches to have more access to their kids and learn this type of international boxing warren is like my son other coaches have the feeling that i raised this kid ive been with him all my life then they take him away they have to find a way to mix it all together
5567723 the majority of the personal coaches have never been to an international bout but theyre advising this guy how to box at the olympics
5567724 you have the kid caught in between he has his allegiance to his personal coach
5567725 we have a number of parents and coaches who recognize that the best social environment for these kids is to be in a training facility where you wake up in the morning and youre thinking boxing all day long
5567726 we want to increase the communications with the parents and the personal coaches early on about what the expectations are
5567727 when the residency program kicked off london 2012 olympics was really the vantage point were ahead of schedule were on a long term mission
5567728 based on our programs and success our organization has had in the last year
5567729 were a sport that needs to grow and improve from a grassroots standpoint we need more young athletes trying boxing we need more big kids trying boxing instead of immediately turning to football or basketball
5567730 you to death with fees for everything from checking accounts to withdrawing money from an atm the banking industry is intensely competitive these fees can add it quickly over the course of the year if your bank is charging you fees to do business its time to find another bank
5567731 evidently we didnt do enough work in the last 10 days
5567732 like i told them its my fault for trying to save them a little bit and not beat them up on the practice field so we came down here and got beat up in the game
5567733 a hat trick in a quarter is not a bad night
5567734 as you saw we didnt play very good they outcoached us they outplayed us we were in it for a second
5567735 then we got too many penalties and penalties changed field position the first quarter basically was the game it was unbelievable
5567736 pandangan itu semata mata penglahiran peribadi seorang bekas presiden indonesia yang kita di malaysia sudah maklum tentang pendirian dan reputasi beliau
5567737 kita juga melihat kenyataan gus dur itu dalam konteks yang sama oleh pemimpin dan bekas pemimpin amerika syarikat yang memperdaya anwar dalam percaturan politik antarabangsa
5567738 thats a mental mistake he made right there its not a lack of effort
5567739 i think everybody in here will do everything possible to make sure it doesnt happen again its not in joes hands any more its in nobodys hands but ours
5567740 it bothers me you get choked up a little bit because its like man weve got something real special here we dont need to be talking about this stuff
5567741 whats hurt us here is whats happened in the batters box we just havent swung the bats well in whats invariably a hitters park
5567742 hes going to be in my mind one of the best players to play the game you dont want anybody looking at you like you really dont want it
5567743 weve been watching this storm for several days actually about seven days ago we first started working closely with the national hurricane center and weve been tracking it as it approached the mainland weve been moving assets and resources into the area for the last several days and just closely monitoring all the activities
5567744 we always need to be prepared and this is a good way for the federal government to show that preparedness operationally we bring in all our federal partners who are there to assist the fema regions and ultimately the states where the citizens of our country live and through our efforts here we are able to bring together the entire federal community as well as agencies like the american red cross to make certain we have a well coordinated response to any kind of hazard that could occur around the country
5567745 as situations we warrant we bring in additional staff from the federal government all of our support agencies from the department of defense the us coast guard the tsa the army corps of engineers to be able to support us in the eventuality that we have a real disaster
5567746 fema is a lot more pro active than it was several years ago we work very closely to support the states and were well prepared for any situation
5567747 now this whole musharraf excuse is behind us now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5567748 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5567749 i am going with the satisfaction that whatever i have done was for the people and for the country i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5567750 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5567751 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5567752 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5567753 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order
5567754 its a huge challenge and they cannot face it individually its very important for them to work together and i think they know that
5567755 america wants some immediate decisions on fighting terrorism and i dont think they will be able to concentrate on that
5567756 on the other hand are the people of this country the business community and there too i dont see any new initiatives
5567757 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5567758 whatever one might say it may be difficult for the politicians to give him the indemnity
5567759 long has our nation the united states of america kept the forces of chaos at bay
5567760 by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe
5567761 britain is the worst country in the western world in which to be a child according to a recent unicef report ordinarily i would not set much store by such a report but in this case i think it must be right not because i know so much about childhood in all the other 20 countries examined but because the childhood that many british parents give to their offspring is so awful that it is hard to conceive of worse at least on a mass scale the two poles of contemporary british child rearing are neglect and overindulgence
5567762 long has our nation the united states of america kept the forces of chaos at bay
5567763 by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe
5567764 from 1973 to 1990 the united states sold saddam hussein more than a quarter of his weapons
5567765 and the british public gets its information from where the bbc this poll says more about the bbc than it does about the poor fish who learn about the world from it
5567766 an officer that leaves his post needs to be fired
5567767 a protest is only good if we know that a protest is being held
5567768 if this was a breakdown in communication between the administration and the police department then it is in need of immediate repair
5567769 if this was a protest move then precise action needs to be taken
5567770 some things we have suggested have not been very popular but when we were kids we had to take strong medicine for what ails us we didnt like it but it was for the best
5567771 its ok to call the director to approve overtime i dont think anyone expects our officers to work with only two people
5567772 what do people mean when they type olympics 2008 asked shashi seth the chief revenue officer of cooliris a menlo park startup whose software lets users preview web links images and 3 d video without clicking on them
5567773 the pakistani political class is a tiny self indulgent elite addicted to plotting and anti american conspiracy theories only the rare individual is capable of seeing beyond his or her own personal or sectional self interest this elite has hated pervez musharraf since long before he foolishly went after the supreme court in pakistan partly because hes an ethnic outsider a mohajir born in india arriving in pakistan during partition but also because in his first years in power he broke with traditional corrupt government practice
5567774 the united states as it has done so many times put all its eggs in one basket in the military ruler musharraf and perceptions of the us have plummeted along with musharrafs career an overwhelming percentage of pakistanis are opposed to musharrafs war against militants in pakistans tribal areas seeing it as an unnecessary american intervention that has made pakistan less secure
5567775 in a proximate sense this seems unambiguously good musharraf is right to think that fighting the impeachment drive would be a disaster for pakistan and in a long term sense it would serve the united states well to shift from too much of a reliance on a relationship with musharraf specifically to a broader engagement with pakistani society in the medium term however what im hearing from people is that the problem now is that the governing coalition will have to actually do something the focus on musharraf was among other things a way to avoid taking full responsibility for dealing with pakistans considerable problems
5567776 in the worlds search for new forms of power one man has yet to be harnessed michael phelps
5567777 the olympic medalist has broken record after record using in part his amazing dolphin kick what if phelps used that kick to serve his country harnessed that kick could provide perhaps 10 000 kilowatts of power to your home every night
5567778 others could be taught to emulate his kick part time summer jobs could be created for kids looking for work instead of selling plasma college kids could sell an hour of their time in the dolphin kick pool a new anti obesity program could be developed for school children a contest how many kilowatts can you power with your dolphin kick
5567779 some might argue nbc isnt there to report the news about china just the news going on inside the olympics in china which while a leaky argument doesnt save the networks reputation because there was scandal to report there too like how a certain record breaking swimmer became the greatest olympian ever under a shroud of controversy over his narrow victory in one event but that would mean raising a stink about nbcs hero
5567780 what is the first question jason lezak is asked in one of 2 million packages nbc has mass produced in the past few days how did it feel to help michael with one of his eight gold medals
5567781 this may be shocking media people but while his teammates are no doubt excited for him they are not winning for phelps benefit and they arent throwing races to let him win maybe you could focus your questions on the athletes you are actually interviewing
5567782 they are going to discuss details what if anything can be worked out
5567783 it has nothing to do with her or her performance or her listenership or her sponsorship
5567784 it was slicing the talk pie pretty thin and we just found that quite honestly it was like trying to push a boulder uphill
5567785 of a certain mind set who are hungry to hear their own voice coming back at them on the radio
5567786 the station is on for 24 hours but my three hours were the only revenue producing hours
5567787 you could drive from the east coast to the west coast and never hear anything other than a right wing point of view
5567788 recognizing that western pennsylvania has predominantly been a democratic area
5567789 lynn has offered an alternative and thats probably what people are going to miss the most
5567790 tavis smiley presents america i am the african american imprint
5567791 what the exhibition does is tells the story of the african american imprint on this country for the 400 years that weve been here starting with the first slaves who arrived in jamestown va 400 years ago all the way up to barack obama
5567792 its important to know that there is a back story to barack obama he didnt just fall out of the sky theres a back story that made this moment possible
5567793 so much black history and so much american history thats come out of the great city of pittsburgh
5567794 never before has this much black history been assembled in one place
5567795 it gives the chance for all of america to see what the contributions of african americans have been to this country
5567796 its a perfect opportunity both to celebrate the history of television and at the same time introduce new generations to some of the mediums most important events
5567797 evidently we didnt do enough work in the last 10 days
5567798 like i told them its my fault for trying to save them a little bit and not beat them up on the practice field so we came down here and got beat up in the game
5567799 as soon as we got back to practice amani showed me
5567800 hes the best in the business at that he knows just how to stay in even if he has to fall doing it
5567801 a hat trick in a quarter is not a bad night
5567802 i wish to to awaken fully from my dream and remember it
5567803 we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to you know not having not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class theres a pervasive sense i think that this country as wealthy and powerful as we are still dont spend enough time thinking about the least of us
5567804 perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest i think after 9 11 my friends instead of telling people to go shopping or take a trip we should have told americans to join the peace corps americorps the military expand our volunteers expand what youre doing
5567805 people are starting to lose faith in the american dream
5567806 under the approach im taking if you make 150 000 or less you will see a tax cut if youre making 250 000 or more youre going to see a modest increase what i am trying to do is create a sense of balance
5567807 digital studio for the development of intellectual properties across multiple platforms
5567808 to help fit in those constraints digital rapids and microsoft came up with a new technology called dynamic complexity that scales the amount of encoding power from the cpu based on what is being shown for example with an actual sporting event you want to make sure all of those action packed bits get transmitted so the video doesnt get compressed as much for something more sedate like video of a talking head you dont need as many bits so you can compress the video more the dynamic complexity helps even out the loads being carried by the bandwidth
5567809 im sorry dave im afraid i cant let you drink that
5567810 maybe in the same way that benjamin says the difference between follow ing with the eye while resting on a summer afternoon a mountain range on the horizon and experiencing that same mountain at a remove imagine a picture postcard makes it harder to appreciate the real thing social media technologies are creating simulacra of social connection facsimiles of friendship
5567811 if the mothers declaration of love had genuine private emotional weight wouldnt she take at least a little care to guard it from public hearing
5567812 if sincerity is the avoidance of being false to any man through being true to ones own self we can see that this state of personal existence is not to be attained without the most arduous effort
5567813 no one has much difficulty with the answer to this question from rousseau we learned that what destroys our authenticity is society our sentiment of being depends upon the opinion of other people
5567814 what we now need to see from pakistan is political stability and thats very important because in the pakistan afghanistan area is where in our view the current hot bed of international terrorism is mr smith said on sydney radio 2gb
5567815 my proposal was accepted i get to present at the conference
5567816 you know a special occasion like this calls for a special dinner
5567817 would you like to go out you could be off k p for one night
5567818 i dont mind it besides i kind of have something special planned unless of course youd prefer going out
5567819 you have something pla now how did you know to plan something
5567820 this was a little bird named kim i take it
5567821 hmm let me see yep so how about crab stuffed whitefish with domaine ste michelle brut
5567822 of course yes you know my answer to you is always yes
5567823 well let me back up a bit you might remember that one part of the conference has to do with designing libraries of the future
5567824 and i think most of the proposals other people sent in probably have to do with high tech stuff but the more i thought about it the more i thought that when patrons come into a library the latest high tech gadget isnt necessarily the first thing theyre looking for
5567825 right so absolutely everything needs to be easy to find
5567826 the main desk is here so you see it as soon as you come in
5567827 what if you want a computer instead of a person
5567828 this is well thought out why didnt you show me all this before
5567829 aww you know i didnt want to shout about it and then have it not get in
5567830 its wonderful you are going to win a medal of brilliance
5567831 i got to the part where i said we dont know why someone comes into the library and some smartass piped up and said yes we do weve compiled all these statistics from questionnaires
5567832 i told him first of all those questionnaires measured the past not the future and second libraries are always trying to expand their audience thats the point of discussing the library of the future and the point of my design is to make a library inviting to everyone not just certain groups
5567833 i put a special gift in your suitcase did you open it
5567834 oh my god is this what i think it is
5567835 i know i spent a lot of time finding it rub it across your mouth louisa just pretend im with you
5567836 im wearing a red blouse today and my bra is red lace to match
5567837 i think you know by now what it sounds like when i unzip my pants in front of you
5567838 now take my cock and rub it over your breasts
5567839 im rubbing the head of your cock over my nipples
5567840 thats good baby now touch me stroke me with your hands
5567841 yes ive got my dick out and im stroking it for you im feeling your hands on me louisa i want you to jack me off

5567847 oh god yes im riding your cock so hard christ
5567848 hold the phone down there i want to listen while you cum
5567849 wasnt there an old commercial about the phone being the next best thing to being there
5567850 if so i dont remember it listen angel did you like that
5567851 iphone and nokia owners who regularly call north america can purchase truphones bundle to get peace of mind pricing of just 1 5 us cents 0 75 pence per minute to the usa and canada from anywhere in the world people dont want to calculate precise per minute rates or check tariff websites or take a paid for tariff bolt on to get a still high rate they simply want to feel comfortable about what theyre going to pay for the call they want to make

5567862 as bad as it sounds i think they can take whoever they want lightly and no ones going to beat them you saw them shooting half court shots before the game
5567863 theyre probably the second best team the united states has ever had third best
5567864 the crazy thing is kobe bryant isnt scoring a lot of points no one is theyre doing it together you dont know who do you stop who do you double

5567866 that guy patrick femerling our center hes going to retire this year
5567867 and so i was like the coach talked to me and he wanted to start him and i said thats cool man no problem
5567868 i mean we didnt plan on winning this game we wanted to try but we didnt plan on winning youre not looking forward to the u s game as a win
5567869 it was unbelievable in that stadium whether youre from the u s germany wherever youre from just all those people being in one place it was awesome

5567872 the holocaust was an obscene period in our nations history
5567873 results suggest that trainers under time constraints could increase their training effectiveness during the early stages of training by not feeding excess dietary energy
5567874 we dont want to give the impression that you should starve them in order to enhance their good behavior
5567875 horses being ridden by less experienced riders need to be calm and easy to handle characteristics that may be enhanced by more effective early training
5567876 liquorland is a successful asset for db breweries so while we are looking at the option to sell we will only consider this if a suitable buyer is identified
5567877 this move does not signal any dissatisfaction with the franchise arrangement in fact the approaches we have received is a sign of the brands strength
5567878 on this particular issue we make it our business not to comment on competitors strategies
5567879 people are more cautious in the current economic environment and the long wet winter probably doesnt help were really pleased with how sales are going
5567880 the retail environment in liquor has been pretty competitive for quite some time now the competitiveness for liquor king isnt necessarily just about price its about convenience
5567881 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5567882 if people have that type of attitude there its stupid
5567883 everybody has issues and makes mistakes or has things to deal with its about turning the page and moving forward and concentrating on whats in front of you rather than concentrating on whats behind you
5567884 hes close to being ready for us which is great
5567885 he didnt intend for any of that to happen and certainly neither did we
5567886 hes never mailed it in he just hasnt stayed healthy so its been unfortunate for us
5567887 evidently we didnt do enough work in the last 10 days
5567888 like i told them its my fault for trying to save them a little bit and not beat them up on the practice field so we came down here and got beat up in the game
5567889 as soon as we got back to practice amani showed me
5567890 hes the best in the business at that he knows just how to stay in even if he has to fall doing it
5567891 a hat trick in a quarter is not a bad night
5567892 as you saw we didnt play very good they outcoached us they outplayed us we were in it for a second
5567893 then we got too many penalties and penalties changed field position the first quarter basically was the game it was unbelievable
5567894 in 2006 rood wrote at the request of a hired representative for an australian owned chemical corporation nufarm obama introduced nine separate bills exempting the company from import fees on a range of chemical ingredients it uses in the manufacture of pesticides and herbicides nufarms u s subsidiary is based in illinois also in may 2006 two washington lobbyists registered to work on behalf of astellas pharma a japanese owned drug company which also has offices in illinois to introduce legislation to temporarily suspend customs duties for the importation of a pharmaceutical ingredient they wrote on their lobbying forms less than three weeks later the men had earned their 20 000 fee thanks to obama on may 26 he introduced s 3155 a bill specifically exempting astellas key ingredient from tariff payments the bill cost the federal government more than 1 million in lost revenue according to government estimates rood wrote 6 only one other 2008 presidential hopeful has introduced more tariff suspension bills than obama longshot gop candidate sen sam brownback kan introduced 30 such measures in the 109th congress rood wrote
5567895 if anyone claims that their religion does not affect their political positions they are either lying or stupid

5567897 making genealogy software available to researchers in their native language is a big step in helping the world trace their family trees
5567898 this is an exciting day for us to help german and swedish researchers
5567899 communities affected by the violence have engaged amongst themselves and although hostility still continues in a few communities the vast majority of those displaced have been reintegrated
5567900 it is now time to listen to victims of violence it is not time for us to accuse each other it is time to restore peace
5567901 it will take time for wounds to heal there is no room for arrogance
5567902 another matter which is of deep concern is justice one cant be seen to be doing for a what were not doing for b you cant be seen to be doing for foreign nationals what youre not prepared to do for south africans

5567908 as a us senator he sponsored no laws as a state senator he specialized in corrupt chicago politics
5567909 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
5567910 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
5567911 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives

5567915 one of the most important goals of our communications program is to provide timely information to the duke community

5567918 obviously i favor senator obamas energy positions and democrats have been by and large the more forward leaning actors
5567919 but john mccain has the best record of any republican running for president on the energy issue and on climate change
5567920 im very encouraged about where the presidential rhetoric is in this campaign
5567921 bbc asian network is proud to be involved again with this important cultural event under the stars offers a great opportunity to spotlight some of the best contemporary asian music around and positioning new talents such as zeekay and 3mix alongside artists like jay sean is a really important part of this event
5567922 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5567923 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5567924 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5567925 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5567926 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5567927 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5567928 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5567929 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5567930 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5567931 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5567932 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5567933 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5567934 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5567935 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5567936 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5567937 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5567938 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5567939 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5567940 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5567941 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5567942 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5567943 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5567944 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5567945 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5567946 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5567947 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5567948 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5567949 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5567950 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5567951 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5567952 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5567953 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5567954 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5567955 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5567956 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5567957 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5567958 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5567959 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5567960 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5567961 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5567962 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5567963 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5567964 ea is saying we want to pay less take two is saying they want more the important thing is that they are talking
5567965 remains confident that antitrust issues will not prevent or delay a transaction
5567966 our sales results for the quarter while better than our forecast reflect the realities of the continuing macroeconomic pressures on our industry
5567967 while q3 will not be as strong and q2 was helped by seasonal and stimulus checks this is the first time in recent memory that the company did not lower guidance and actually raised it which is a major psychological change and keeps us bullish on the company and our other quality names
5567968 youre just not going to go shopping when you got three kids with you
5567969 its really an event if we can capture some revenue off it terrific
5567970 it really is a true regional event that brings people downtown to celebrate the coming holidays
5567971 we wanted to make this movie part of the national conversation before the election
5567972 we are actually showing the film at both the democratic and republican conventions after the premiere
5567973 we are hoping that the presidential candidates will take up these issues and take a leadership position in helping to resolve them and lead a conversation about them which is not happening now
5567974 its economics and it seems like a difficult subject to understand
5567975 but we have succeeded in making it a fun and entertaining movie we convey an important message but at the same time its not so heavy people cant understand it
5567976 we intentionally didnt want to make it like inconvenient truth or any michael moore film
5567977 we wanted to make this entertaining but also convey the important message of the crisis we face
5567978 this is a big challenge for us a lot of people have tried and failed
5567979 i think the expectation in the community is that until we have the higher end destination retail there isnt any reason to shop downtown so we have to do it
5567980 saks fifth avenues departure would make the opportunity to attract similar retailers even less compelling
5567981 indeed one has to wonder whether the ubiquitous brands already in the golden triangle talbots ann taylor joseph a bank clothiers and bailey banks amp biddle would remain if the upscale anchor were to leave
5567982 if we can work to put something together with a property owner and a retailer and take it to them we think they would be receptive to that
5567983 cranes are dotting pittsburghs skyline downtown living is on the rise and in historic market square business is booming we must build upon this momentum working together to improve pittsburghs retail environment
5567984 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5567985 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5567986 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction
5567987 theyre heavily concentrated in states where home prices are plummeting
5567988 could go down the street and get that loan somewhere else
5567989 it was pretty evident that the only thing that was supporting these loans was higher home prices
5567990 the home buying public is going to have to pay
5567991 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5567992 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5567993 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5567994 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5567995 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5567996 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5567997 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5567998 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5567999 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5568000 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5568001 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5568002 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5568003 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5568004 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5568005 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5568006 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5568007 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5568008 who are open to doing something on the production side
5568009 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5568010 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5568011 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5568012 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5568013 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5568014 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5568015 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5568016 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5568017 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5568018 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5568019 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5568020 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5568021 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5568022 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5568023 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5568024 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5568025 faith is just a worldview and everybody has some kind of worldview and its important to know what they are
5568026 does evil exist and if it does do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it or do we defeat it
5568027 the civil rights act of 64 says that faith based organizations have the right to hire people that believe like they do would you insist that faith based organizations forfeit that right to access federal funds
5568028 as christians we are called to help orphans widows the sick the poor and others in need should we ask or expect the government to pay us to do what god calls us to do
5568029 america right now ranks 19th in high school graduation were first in incarcertaions eighty percent of americans recently polled said they believe in merit pay for teachers do you think better teachers should be paid better
5568030 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5568031 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5568032 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5568033 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5568034 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5568035 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5568036 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5568037 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5568038 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations

5568049 laudatory effort to ensure that front line agents are given clear rules to follow in pursuit of their investigations
5568050 nevertheless efforts to harmonize the rules governing criminal and national security matters also raise potential civil liberties concerns given the broader latitude currently given to investigators to consider race and ethnicity in national security matters
5568051 the important aims of the guidelines and their potential implications for civil liberties require a meaningful dialogue between congress and doj
5568052 we continue to discuss this with congress and we are carefully reviewing the suggestions we have received from these discussions

5568057 mayers childish behavior only confirms she was right to dump him now hes acting like a spoiled child expect jen to behave like a lady
5568058 i left here when i was 21 and when i left here i was a drug addict
5568059 but like so many ex drug addicts i just switched from drugs to alcohol and then i became an alcoholic
5568060 it was a film about drugs and he talked the producer into hiring me as a consultant
5568061 i would leave every day go to hollywood work on the movie and return at night
5568062 i read about 25 screenplays all of which were crap
5568063 so i sat down and wrote dance in about three months
5568064 i got these rave reviews and i thought i was william shakespeare
5568065 i had the most money i ever had in my life
5568066 i didnt buy a new car or anything i put it all in the bank and drank it up
5568067 i checked into the drunk hospital and have been sober ever since
5568068 i didnt know you love your grandchildren more than you love your original children
5568069 once i had a grandbaby i had to stick around see how this turns out
5568070 in my situation everything that could go right did i was out of the hospital in eight days and back to playing basketball in two months
5568071 i never thought about donating organs until i needed a liver
5568072 i tell people if i was working the pearly gates and you showed up missing some organs id move you to the front of the line
5568073 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5568074 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5568075 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction
5568076 a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5568077 clearly quite tight and effectively getting tighter as a result of ongoing pressure on lenders cost of funds in the market
5568078 given there had been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect tighter financial conditions were not warranted
5568079 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5568080 all they are really saying here is that if they dont move towards less restrictive conditions the risk of a deeper or more persistent slowing of the economy would increase
5568081 they dont want that which is an argument to cut rates but by the same token the language is not strong enough to suggest they are heading towards a 50 basis point cut next month
5568082 i think it is consistent with 25 basis points next month
5568083 deterioration across several fronts leads us to believe that an unfavourable fundamental backdrop will be much protracted
5568084 all the conditions that helped drive capital inflows in the first quarter have now vanished
5568085 falling commodity prices will be a net negative for the trade account national income and the fiscal balance
5568086 i think it is because of the intense training if he had been more relaxed the injury might not have been so bad
5568087 i have experienced in the past the great pressure that government officials exert on the athletes as well as the coach and that they demand a gold medal otherwise it is meaningless liu xiang is still a young boy and he has been put under a bit too much expectation

5568097 it appears now that the chances are less that central north carolina will get beneficial rains from the system
5568098 the mountains still have a chance but it will be later in the weekend
5568099 these tropical systems do play a part in helping us get our normal yearly rainfall
5568100 thats why we were exceptionally dry last year now its looking like the chances are decreasing that we will get help from this system as far as rainfall is concerned
5568101 the whole time its over land it will be weakening
5568102 unless theres something to tear it apart the system can actually survive for quite a while its pretty hard to kill these tropical systems unless you have an upper level feature tearing it apart
5568103 but you also dont want 3 to 4 inches falling in six hours
5568104 it can be a double edged sword you want rain but you dont want it all at once

5568117 investors have been trying to put the housing and credit crisis behind them they want to believe were in the eighth or ninth inning but every time news like this comes up they have to readjust their thinking
5568118 there is a lot of uncertainty with what happens in terms of capital raising and a lot of investors are in a wait and see mode
5568119 from a gse perspective as long as they get funding it does not matter at what price as they will just pass it on with higher mortgage rates

5568125 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5568126 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5568127 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5568128 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5568129 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5568130 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5568131 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5568132 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall
5568133 i think its the most beautiful performance in the world
5568134 in the end god bless pakistan god bless all of you long live pakistan always
5568135 now this whole musharraf excuse is behind us now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5568136 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5568137 i am going with the satisfaction that whatever i have done was for the people and for the country i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5568138 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5568139 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5568140 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5568141 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order
5568142 america wants some immediate decisions on fighting terrorism and i dont think they will be able to concentrate on that
5568143 on the other hand are the people of this country the business community and there too i dont see any new initiatives
5568144 our no 1 point is if we have it here in town it would be a matter of public safety
5568145 i think its going to be less safe where is there one study that says the roads are safer after that
5568146 were making sure weve done all the right things to shore up our decision making process
5568147 you really cant go wrong in the long run if you find those kinds of investments
5568148 there are plenty of new residential ghost towns in the west in places like nevada california arizona
5568149 why would anyone want to build new shopping strips malls hotels and offices in such ghost towns
5568150 its not like they dont know whats going on out there
5568151 if i got the right price i might go out and buy residential mortgage backed securities
5568152 and from the best ways of dealing with the ignorant is to ignore and avoid them this is because if you debate with them they beat you and if you beat them they will end up hating you and will not admit your being correct therefore ignore them

5568156 the zespri youthbank programme is an excellent idea and an experience that the students will take with them for the rest of their lives if other people started doing more of this kind of thing the world could be a much better place
5568157 there are many key functions to zespri youthbank firstly it teaches the students about the groups in their community that are in need it shows them the wide range of issues that are out there and it makes them look further into the value that these community groups provide the students then gain the satisfaction of giving and supporting those community groups one of the best things about zespri youthbank is that many smaller deserving community groups that often fall below the corporate donations radar get access to funding

5568175 the military will continue to fight and the political government will continue to negotiate the negotiations have to continue as it is now an issue of saving pakistani society from the hands of the taliban

5568177 watson come here i need you were the exact words
5568178 what i will remember most was his devotion to wake forest and to its people
5568179 tom embodied the very best of the universitys ideals he was a leader and moved the university in keeping with its aspirations
5568180 he wanted to make sure that winston salem was allied to wake forest and that wake forest was allied with winston salem
5568181 that was one accomplishment that a lot of people didnt know about
5568182 renewed effort for the city in recruiting new businesses and industries to winston salem
5568183 that was a major step in the history of wake forest
5568184 it will be terribly important to be taught by faculty administration trustees and students the people who make it work i will spend a lot of time becoming a member of the wake forest family
5568185 he knew that he had a great athletic director in ron wellman
5568186 tom was a great supporter of all of his coaches he also was a knowledgeable fan

5568195 were guessing it will sort problems like 3g glitches and lost calls
5568196 this is a big to do at the moment but in a few weeks people will have forgotten what the issue was all about its because users expect more from apple there are many more users saying their iphones work than not
5568197 weve got the new firmware up and running and its true those bugs have been fixed
5568198 which bugs well its hard to say but our voice suddenly sounds deeper and weve noticed improved grammar during calls

5568210 we were tired today but no batting practice we just went out there and went right at it
5568211 theyre one of the best teams in the league and we just wanted to keep our momentum going against them and keep on winning
5568212 i was just trying to get a pitch to hit
5568213 it was a good time to hit one because it gave us a lift and the lead and that was good for our confidence
5568214 if i somehow play well enough to win that will be huge
5568215 it is difficult to still play a lot of matches
5568216 i want to recover for the u s open unfortunately i have to pull out of this tournament

5568236 i am extending the invitation to reach an acceptable solution to the issue through discussion
5568237 despite the withdrawal of the support by the jmm i am confident of my success on the floor the game will be witnessed in the assembly and i am prepared for a show of strength
5568238 who has special powers to extend or shorten the session
5568239 the monsoon session of the assembly has been convened from september 19 25 but the time factor is not in my jurisdiction it is up to the governor to take a decision on it but i am confident to come up trumps in the floor test
5568240 musharrafs brazen disrespect for human rights and the rule of law for nearly a decade has finally caught up with him
5568241 by undoing musharrafs unlawful acts and holding him to account for his crimes the pakistani government will advance human rights and national security in the country
5568242 i am 78 and too old to contest any election
5568243 i wont be contesting any political elections but i will undertake bsps poll campaign in all 33 districts of rajasthan from next month till the polls are held

5568249 i hope the international community will show itself fully ready capable and willing to help provide critically needed assistance to the people of georgia
5568250 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5568251 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5568252 musharraf has made the right decision to step down as president of pakistan it is in the interests of the pakistani people to end the political crisis that has immobilised the coalition government for too long
5568253 i had advocated the us move from a musharraf policy to a pakistan policy the opportunity created by musharrafs exit must be utilised to focus on issues like terrorism food and energy shortages and to help people there build a stable secure and democratic future
5568254 us policy must focus on assuring that all elements of pakistans government are resolute in shutting down the safe havens for al qaeda and the taliban there can be no safe haven for terrorists who threaten the american people
5568255 if any word of my speech at the rally at tourist reception centre ground has the potential to harm the unity of the freedom movement i sincerely apologise for it

5568272 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league
5568273 there is no foreclosure at the moment theres a notice thats been posted i dont really have any other comments there should be no real changes for the residents
5568274 how many people getting shot or killed is it going to take
5568275 if other people can shut them down why cant we
5568276 when these guys are robbing these places are they carrying out big bags of stuffed rabbits
5568277 of course not theyve got cash they have to know theyre paying out
5568278 everyone else around is at risk when theres a robber
5568279 its in our neighborhood in a lot of towns thats not the case here theyre amid our homes
5568280 there are some people that are pretty doggone tired of that and i think they have a reason to be
5568281 i tell them as soon as you come in im going to bust you

5568285 we dont want it to happen again and disrupt service
5568286 north korea will continue to try to divide the society ideologically to hinder the national unity we have to prepare measures to cope with this
5568287 the ties between two koreas are tense for now but the relations will recover soon as we work on policies with sincerity and genuine concern about north korea
5568288 reunification can come any day and suddenly so we must always be prepared for that
5568289 it appears that several milf sub commanders are not controlled by the milf leadership and just using the peace process as a blanket to launch violent attacks against the people of mindanao
5568290 we are taking military action to stop these atrocities perpetrated by the milf
5568291 clear manifestation of the insincerity to the peace process of a significant portion of the milf
5568292 our leadership has not sanctioned these attacks this has to stop if we can confirm the involvement of our forces
5568293 they have taken over the business centre the rural banks pawnshops
5568294 all of us are praying here in the room we are all scared
5568295 i hope something should be done to end this crisis a lot of innocent people are becoming victims of this situation
5568296 pursuit operations are ongoing they still have hostages with them
5568297 the strikes will be on confirmed areas where milf members are concentrated the areas are determined by troops on the ground its going to be a well coordinated air strike operation to minimise collateral damage
5568298 in theory working with an unruly fractious coalition government is more difficult than working with someone who has most of the power in his own hands
5568299 but the problem with the theory in this case is that it never worked very well with musharraf
5568300 musharraf worked with us when it suited his interest and to the extent it suited his interest but i think most of us feel that our partnership with musharraf did not produce the fruits that we had hoped for
5568301 focus their collective minds on the major problems challenging both countries
5568302 obviously its a fragile situation in pakistan because its a new civilian government for the first time in a long time in pakistan since 1999 and so our effort is to support that government strengthen it
5568303 what it will do is to remove the automatic link in the pakistani mind that any actions which are taken in the fata federally administered tribal areas and in the frontier generally are american dictated
5568304 weakening that link means that decisions that pakistan is going to take are in its own interest
5568305 so if it moves more aggressively it wouldnt be automatically seen as simply carrying out american command

5568437 atlanta ralph reed once one of the leading strategists in the republican party found himself monday night persona non grata at a fundraiser hosted by his partys presumptive presidential nominee reed had sent an e mail last week encouraging allies to join him at fundraiser for john mccain here but by the time the senator from arizona arrived in atlanta it was clear reed was not attending the event the democratic national committee had spent several days blasting mccain for allowing reed to be involed in the fundraiser because of reeds connections to disgraced lobbyist jack abramoff
5568438 we were listening to the piece about cindy mccain on npr all things considered and it just struck us very hard

5568447 assuming he designed the product right that xerox engineer will get the molds and parts for each of the plastic products he ordered within five or six days

5568452 there is some hard thinking that needs to be done philadelphia federal reserve bank president charles plosser said in an interview last week
5568453 the fed has a terrific reputation as a credible institution we have to be cautious not to undertake things that put that credibility at risk
5568454 they want to placate the congress and the financial markets said fed historian allan meltzer doing so sets a
5568455 how can you be independent on one score and dependent on another
5568456 are overburdening the federal reserve and that sets up the potential for multiple conflicts he said
5568457 they use up their credibility on nonmonetary issues they lose their independence and they dilute their expertise
5568458 it is much harder to say no when you have the precedent said j
5568459 congress needs to find a way to structure something else to take the fed out of this
5568460 they have had to abandon all principles that guided their earlier debates said lou crandall chief economist at wrightson
5568461 but the truth is that the beneficiaries of our actions were not bear stearns and were not even principally wall street it was main street

5568464 he had very bad cell phone coverage and was trying to get a hold of someone he tried to backtrack his way to the starting point and got even more lost
5568465 certainly thats not something we want to have happen again because our primary concern is the safety of participants and getting them home on time
5568466 as soon as we knew the bus was running late we put backup procedures into place but we had a lot of strikes against us because of the lack of cell phone coverage few streetlights and street signs and it was getting dark
5568467 everyone was home before 9 p m later than they should have been but safe and sound our hope is to make this the best situation in providing transportation for the clients
5568468 itll be shocking for her but i dont want her going back there
5568469 we didnt know what else they were going to do and we have a lot of experience transporting program participants
5568470 with changes in the way our services are funded we lost the ability to subsidize substantial losses in transportation with gains in other areas

5568476 you have to be creative they will run me crazy

5568486 his packet modeled the characteristics we saw in josh as well as he met all the academic qualifications
5568487 wanted to create a scholarship based on civility and kindness towards others regardless of their station in life
5568488 the main purpose of the scholarship was that we wanted joshs memory to live on and we wanted to give back and we know thats what josh would have wanted to give back to his community
5568489 then i talked to my neighbor because i had done stuff for her while her husband was in iraq
5568490 just kinda listened to everybody and picked out some good examples of what type of person i thought i was
5568491 josh was a reserved person i mean he wasnt one of those individuals who was loud but he had that aura about him that was helpful and supportive and brad carried those same characteristics high integrity the things that you look for honesty the stewardship too the school and community
5568492 i think thats really the type of person id like to be its just a real honor that people think of me that way
5568493 ive known her for a long time and she just told me that when she was designing the scholarship that i was one of the first people she thought of
5568494 that really meant a lot to me i just thought it was cool that she thought of me when she was doing that

5568515 glittery substance on the right side of the neck the right ear and the right leg
5568516 i frequently encountered humans in cages usually dazed or drugged but sometimes they cried and begged for help
5568517 their new found cockiness has got some substance to it
5568518 but the organisation was terrible the attitude all wrong the aggressive redneck security drove everybody nuts and a bomb killed one and injured 100 why did atlanta do it provincial chippiness to show that anything the smug cities of the west and east could do georgia could do better
5568519 but the sydney games of 2000 were an unqualified success

5568531 in the past a semester has been a typical punishment
5568532 we figured it was precedent we might as well publish it
5568533 its one of the major components of our outreach programs
5568534 we have discussed it at every c tops this summer
5568535 i hate it when students come to me and say they didnt know something was a violation because i cant help them

5568544 college particularly the beginning of college is a time when youre asking many questions about authenticity about who you are
5568545 we always write the books we wish we were able to read at one point in life
5568546 one of the biggest things is just to every once in a while step back and say this is who i am and am i content with myself
5568547 its obvious that the personal narrative of the book really resonated with people
5568548 that really makes sense here they are their parents just left theyre all struggling with different versions of the same thing

5568553 im trying to beat life because i cant cheat death
5568554 gs in the lac weed in the back dps in the act
5568555 itd probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand probly be doin a dubb in the penn with my man
5568556 as the session began and as it built up i felt this lump of emotions welling up and firming up almost like an entity i started to cry a little then it started to dissipate and i started to look at it differently and i think that is the beauty of being able to expand your consciousness i dont think the drug is the cause of these things i think it is a catalyst that allows you to release your own thoughts and feelings from some place that you have bound them to very tightly i began to realise that all of this negative fear and the guilt was such a hindrance to making the most of and enjoying the healthy time that im having however long it may be i was not utilising it to the best and enjoying my life because i was so afraid of what wasnt there yet these substances occur in our natural world and people have been using them for thousands of years to treat physical illness to treat social and behavioural problems
5568557 i think theres a perception these compounds hold untapped potential to help us understand the human mind
5568558 i feel more centered in who i am and what im doing
5568559 i dont seem to have those self doubts like i used to have i feel much more grounded and feel that we are all connected
5568560 brilliant colors and beautiful patterns just stunningly gorgeous more intense than normal reality
5568561 i found myself doing lamaze type breathing as the pain came on
5568562 it was a joyful ecstatic thing at the same time like the joy of being alive
5568563 there was this sense of relief and joy and ecstasy when my heart was opened
5568564 we saw a number of positive results from our investigation of aggressive human breast cancer cells including a lower rate of uncontrolled growth of new cancer cells suppression of their aggressive behaviour and the formation of fewer blood vessels that feed cancer cells essential nutrients
5568565 although natural products have been used to develop many important drugs there is no guarantee that they are all safe or will be effective in the clinic
5568566 further research is needed to know if mushroom extracts can be used to treat cancer patients
5568567 this work provides yet another example of the incredible properties of micro organisms in effecting transformations of metals and minerals in the natural environment
5568568 because fungi are perfectly suited as biogeochemical agents often they dominate the biota in polluted soils and play a major role in the establishment and survival of plants through their association with roots fungal based approaches should not be neglected in our attempts to deal with metal polluted soils
5568569 the fungal produced minerals are capable of long term uranium retention so this may help prevent uptake of uranium by plants animals and microbes it might also prevent the spent uranium from leaching out from the soil
5568570 good god no we dont eat fish meat fruit we dont eat anything its all contaminated you cant you cant
5568571 whats wrong with you theres nothing to fear from my food god will protect you
5568572 if it were contaminated we would have died a long time ago but weve been eating it for 20 years already
5568573 just eat it you wont die god will protect you we eat it and were alive and youll be alright too
5568574 a lot of people are eager to come here to work and we pay this price of not paying attention to radiation
5568575 as the session began and as it built up i felt this lump of emotions welling up and firming up almost like an entity i started to cry a little then it started to dissipate and i started to look at it differently and i think that is the beauty of being able to expand your consciousness i dont think the drug is the cause of these things i think it is a catalyst that allows you to release your own thoughts and feelings from some place that you have bound them to very tightly i began to realise that all of this negative fear and the guilt was such a hindrance to making the most of and enjoying the healthy time that im having however long it may be i was not utilising it to the best and enjoying my life because i was so afraid of what wasnt there yet these substances occur in our natural world and people have been using them for thousands of years to treat physical illness to treat social and behavioural problems
5568576 the only people that seem to be affected by this are latinos
5568577 i got a call about 10 oclock from an abbey court resident saying that the tow trucks had returned and a large crowd had assembled
5568578 it was a pretty grand confrontation or standoff going on there
5568579 we never have discriminated and we never will its simply us trying to enforce the policies so people have a place to park when they come home
5568580 we were just trying to rein in the fees of involuntary towing
5568581 ive always lived in carrboro and this is the first big thing that has happened
5568582 i dont think it represents a big trend or anything
5568583 we decided to buy them with the hope and presumption that the board will support it
5568584 technology is the absolute best way to connect all the pieces
5568585 we dont want them to power down when they walk into the school
5568586 well do the same as we do for any textbook or calculator or anything like that
5568587 they are able to take on the curriculum but theyre falling short
5568588 were looking to give them the organizational skills they need
5568589 just as i would hope they wouldnt be passing notes when theyre not supposed to be i would hope they wouldnt be using them when theyre not supposed to be
5568590 when yale says when you make less than 150 000 well help you and were saying youve got to make less than 50 000 thats a notable difference
5568591 we were the first to offer debt free tuition assistance
5568592 but were not alone anymore and that means we have to work that much harder
5568593 in the applicant pool african american numbers are up asian american numbers are up hispanic numbers are up
5568594 basically across every ethnicity there has been growth in the applicant pool and it has been proportional
5568595 students looking at unc are looking at a lot of very good schools
5568596 for hispanic students one of the things they really look for is how visible the hispanic community is on campus
5568597 people want to feel comfortable at their university thats a big factor in the decision
5568598 theres definitely some anxiety about how im going to fit in
5568599 meeting new teenagers is always a challenge because you never know how theyre going to interact with you
5568600 one of the strong points about our training was they gave us so many ideas but they were very honest to say that every community is going to be different
5568601 the program allows you to be as creative as you want to be
5568602 i definitely dont want to go in with the mentality of were going in on a white horse to save the school
5568603 the ccac advisers will ease the burden on guidance counselors
5568604 also by virtue of their youth background and experiences the ccac advisers are uniquely positioned to connect with students
5568605 tell those amarillas de mierda yellow shits that you are much better than them dont hold back tell them tell them from me you have to believe in yourself youre better than those amarillas de mierda
5568606 in this case i dont know that there will be any federal charges and thats not up to me
5568607 we just have to work together on logistics on timing and that kind of thing
5568608 the unsealing of these search warrant affidavits would be detrimental to the federal investigation which is ongoing
5568609 i think that chris will be coming home for this semester
5568610 our major concern is about the girls and their families
5568611 its just been a tragedy for everybody its very out of character
5568612 if he were to return to school and thats a big if and the charges were still in play he would be suspended
5568613 chris is a good person who has made a serious mistake
5568614 as coaches we are always worried about the dangers associated with drinking and driving and with alcohol in general
5568615 come now and let us reason together saith the lord though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool
5568616 by and large we defer to the universitys alcohol policy
5568617 he healeth the broken in heart and bindeth up their wounds
5568618 were still a year away from the admissions process being live
5568619 sometimes they can be fun sometimes they can be pretty grueling
5568620 we want the implementation of the system to follow the life of a student
5568621 that is why we are starting with the admissions process
5568622 when you start you see foundation and frame and that is exciting thats where we are now when you start bringing it along though you can see it coming together and that is where we are going this year
5568623 this process has allowed us to rethink how the student brain works
5568624 its almost a fresh start as far as software goes
5568625 once we saw the similarities we were quick to act
5568626 one of the trustees said he was looking for a little more wow
5568627 my anxiety is more about how this single design does or does not fit into the context of the campus
5568628 i think the new elements coupled together will give the building a more formidable handsome look
5568629 the average food increase from last year alone was close to 9 percent
5568630 we said this is what we need to pay our bills
5568631 i felt that they saw that what we were doing was a fair passing on of costs
5568632 id like to be positive that maybe not because fuels going down that is a huge cost to all this
5568633 it gives the students a chance to see the real world outside of the classroom
5568634 its like the university was just waiting for someone to come along with this idea
5568635 they are always talking about developing a more intellectual climate and thats what this does
5568636 it was funny at first because youre seeing all of these faces youre used to seeing at 8 a m when nobody is awake
5568637 it was awkward at first but we found enough to keep the conversation going
5568638 it makes it seem like you have some sort of connection to this person thats teaching you
5568639 instead of just seeing this giant brain at the front you see a little more of a person
5568640 if professors put ideas out there students will probably want to do them
5568641 and that is passed on to the students with rent charges
5568642 were at a point where we cant raise rent any more so were putting the renovation process on hold after this year
5568643 we didnt change the look and feel of the building
5568644 all the furniture and stuff is new so that makes it really cool
5568645 plus they have that hill they have to walk up every day
5568646 the asbestos was in the floor tiles which is not a dangerous form
5568647 even when people are living in these buildings there isnt health concern
5568648 for over the river christo and jeanne claude plan to suspend a canopy of silvery fabric panels above a 40 mile stretch of the arkansas river in colorado using six miles of fabric there will be breaks for bridges or simply for the look
5568649 canadas mens eights rowing squad today captured captured canadas second gold of the beijing olympics and the fourth medal of the day
5568650 the mayors committee saw the first draft of our report on the structural soundness and feasibility of the wallace deck as a site for kidzu and gave a very positive response
5568651 we were going to start in a small space establish ourselves in the community and help people understand how important a childrens museum is
5568652 i think its a very important component of continuing to revitalize downtown chapel hill
5568653 in my viewpoint kidzu is one of those economic engines in that it draws parents and children and visitors to that destination
5568654 we are successful but to what degree has yet to be determined
5568655 this issue goes beyond just whats in our own back yards
5568656 when you look at other new developments in this town its a window to see what our town is morphing into
5568657 times have changed and peoples expectations and desires are different now
5568658 would you want to live in my house knowing theres the possibility of having bulldozers in your backyard
5568659 ive lived here so long ive raised my kids here
5568660 if i wanted to live with people on top of me i could move to meadowmont
5568661 our longtime goal is to do something that the community and neighborhood will be proud of that can stand the test of time
5568662 we want it to be a wonderful place to live
5568663 winmore has the best selling new homes in the area right now
5568664 we have had 10 sales in less than a year
5568665 were in discussion with folks who will build the affordable housing
5568666 its not my place to criticize just to make sure it meets ordinances
5568667 it is a great thing to let students know they are just temporary residents
5568668 the students that live in the neighborhood around downtown are an integral part of the community
5568669 we want students to have a good time yet still be respectful of their neighbors
5568670 it has grown from a small effort to a big collaborative effort
5568671 there is also not a lot of people just standing in front of houses and everyone knows everyone more
5568672 we have seen a drop in noise violations over time
5568673 and even the trash is picked up most of the time
5568674 what we hear from residents is that communication with students goes much smoother and is much more open
5568675 editorial independence and press freedom of all exclusively student edited campus media
5568676 theyre not going to kick us out of our leases or anything like that
5568677 the only thing i know is what ive read in the paper
5568678 im just in an office so its not as important for me as it might be for retail
5568679 we still have several years on our lease and im sure when its closer to the time well be talking with the university more
5568680 we know the university has the best interest of the town at heart
5568681 we want to look at what people are interested in seeing there
5568682 were open to all and any suggestions at this point
5568683 what we do look at for the potential impact of the drought as far as well permits go are replacement well permits and irrigation well permits
5568684 most of the water problems we see in the county we see through sampling
5568685 these cause water quality not health issues people really want to fix problems if they turn on the faucet and it looks like russian tea because of iron they want to do something about it
5568686 overall were a lot smarter than we were a few years ago
5568687 we always balance at budget time the debt burden versus our desire to keep orange county affordable for as many people as possible
5568688 the affordability is still there but you have to be more creative in how you do things
5568689 we know how to be creative enough to make sure that people can still afford our properties
5568690 we told the voters that if we didnt have an alternative means we would have to raise property taxes that much more
5568691 we dont like that we have to pay it just like everybody else
5568692 we take pride in funding schools at the highest levels
5568693 we have citizens who require a high level of service for a variety of things they expect things of orange county that maybe other counties dont provide
5568694 with the way the bush economy is im not sure were going to want to put that on the ballot this year
5568695 we dont want to cut off enrollment to make sure we always have enough beds we do not want to turn students away
5568696 id like to think that the university is in demand
5568697 but ultimately we cant be sure we did hire more admissions people and told them to recruit we want this trend to continue
5568698 we recently made changes to our curriculum that may be more appealing to more students
5568699 weve increased our number of beds by 25 percent since 2002
5568700 for the next five years or so were pretty well positioned
5568701 they had to dig out the ground just to make a reading on this gauge
5568702 weve got some extreme problems in the west but at least the message is getting out
5568703 its going to take a lot of work by a lot of people to get through this drought
5568704 this year is a matter of finding a way to get through
5568705 if north carolina is to continue making economic progress all our communities must effectively manage their water supplies
5568706 weve had the aurora property for a number of years
5568707 it was a matter of finding the best use for it
5568708 we were ecstatic about the opportunity to move into a larger location in the same general area
5568709 in der steiermark haben wir die unterschriften schon vergangene woche zusammen gehabt und wir werden schon am dienstag die landes und regionalwahllisten einreichen man kann ber die kp l stern soviel man will in der organisation haben wir schon immer gut gearbeitet
5568710 they range from the late 80s through the fairly recent past
5568711 dr levine has made an enormous contribution to the well being of children struggling in school he has dedicated his entire life to helping children and saving families
5568712 complaints are private under the law so i cant confirm or deny whether complaints were made
5568713 a lot of times theres no grounds for the board to act
5568714 i thought it was going to be like one at a grocery store
5568715 i didnt realize it was going to be an actual starbucks
5568716 i lived in parker residence hall so i wouldve gone last year
5568717 and i dont know maybe itll end up being a good place to study
5568718 its a safe zone to talk about issues that are usually taboo
5568719 theyre doing a lot of intensive work in small groups looking at the issues that divide them
5568720 theyre also looking at what as students they want to be when they get back to campus
5568721 when you look at the demographics of the university it looks really diverse but there isnt a lot of intermingling of the variety of groups on campus
5568722 it was billed so heavily as solely a diversity program that a lot of people who didnt think they had anything to learn didnt join
5568723 it was too geared down too watered down gearing the focus toward student leaders inherently changed the program
5568724 it was probably a success because we got the buy in from the right people
5568725 i feel like the carolina united experience has been nothing short of amazing
5568726 we can discuss issues and ideas and not worry about judgment
5568727 smalem gw digigit vampir pagi ini jadi sensitip ma sinar matahari
5568728 scaling our manufacturing capacity while taking advantage of existing infrastructure will incrementally lower the manufacturing cost per watt at a rate comparable to our lowest cost facility in malaysia
5568729 the expansion of our operations in ohio is a direct result of the outstanding achievements of our associates and a strong ongoing partnership with state and local leaders
5568730 the state of ohio is proud to support industry leaders like first solar who are using renewable energy to power the future
5568731 in making this significant investment and expansion in toledo first solar is helping us to send a message to the world that ohio is reinventing itself as the leader in the advanced energy industry
5568732 solar energy reduces greenhouse gas emissions and strengthens our national and energy security ohio is proud of its partnership with first solar and that partnership has been a resounding success this is a great example of how we can harness ohios manufacturing base to become the silicon valley of alternative energy
5568733 if i was doing this just for myself i might have chosen a different course
5568734 whether i win or lose the impeachment the dignity of the nation would be damaged the office of the president harmed
5568735 even if i beat this impeachment relations between the presidency and the government can never be fixed
5568736 pillars of the state parliament and the judiciary would be harmed and god forbid the army might have been dragged in

5568738 no nos encontramos al final de la historia apenas comenzamos a comprender que de las ruinas de esta vieja civilizaci n pueden surgir nuevos retos para convertirlos en cambio y del interior de una crisis que no es paz el parto de una nueva civilizaci n que hay que construir
5568739 christianity has functioned for the normative self understanding of modernity as more than a mere precursor or a catalyst egalitarian universalism from which sprang the ideas of freedom and social solidarity of an autonomous conduct of life and emancipation of the individual morality of conscience human rights and democracy is the direct heir to the judaic ethic of justice and the christian ethic of love this legacy substantially unchanged has been the object of continual critical appropriation and reinterpretation to this day there is no alternative to it and in the light of the current challenges of a post national constellation we continue to draw on the substance of this heritage everything else is just idle postmodern talk
5568740 is mind boggling when you consider the implications what we can do at least theoretically its so simple but the ultimate in advanced thinking of approaching the world around us with a whole new set of rules
5568741 this is not hit or miss the plans blueprints if you will are right there its as simple as manufacturing processing the materials then putting them together its astounding
5568742 in the early going it had the highest score but that was based in part on local support which i think has now changed pretty dramatically
5568743 i dont accept all the arguments made by opponents of the facility
5568744 some arguments are without any rational foundation that is fear mongering
5568745 we had 54 cases of tb in 2007 sixty five percent of those were foreign born
5568746 the treatment has been the same for 20 or 30 years requiring anywhere from two to four different medications that are taken over six to nine months
5568747 people distrust the medical profession in their new country and many times people dont have insurance
5568748 if theyre here illegally at the public health clinics weve had a long standing practice of just not asking
5568749 i can think of no justifiable reason why the former nccu leadership would have completely ignored and failed to abide by the appropriate approval process
5568750 i dont believe it was some scheme that was derived at n c central i dont know whose idea it was
5568751 i dont think it should be happening if its going to interfere with the universitys accreditation
5568752 it has to be done correctly because it has to be fair to the students and it has to be fair to the university
5568753 this is a first step and its a good first step
5568754 it sounds like what we ought to be doing but it doesnt work because its much too broad
5568755 im going to reintroduce it in january when we reconvene
5568756 with our economy the way it is and with gas people want to be able to have options
5568757 bills like that often you cant expect to pass them in one session you have to keep making changes and tweaking it
5568758 its just a very simple policy that bullying shouldnt be tolerated in our school system
5568759 its a big problem even in chapel hill kids harass boys who may look feminine or girls who may look masculine
5568760 making local to global connections and understanding responsibilities of community membership
5568761 thats not what they should have had but yet when you look around at other states thats about as much as most folks were able to do
5568762 we would have liked to have more money for pay raises and state employees
5568763 it puts people to work when you start building programs like this
5568764 you have to hope that it will stimulate that we will come out of this recession
5568765 its possible that people learn when they drink they feel better early on
5568766 what now is being understood is that there are different types of depression
5568767 this type that emerges seems to be the worst kind studies in humans have shown that negative mood is one of the primary reasons alcoholics report starting to drink again
5568768 what we found was that neurogenesis was reduced not by alcohol drinking itself but that occurred two weeks later as well
5568769 when the season was over aleric mullins was definitely the leader who got everybody together and said that he was done playing games with this football stuff
5568770 he was going to start taking it serious i think that attitude really reflected on the whole team our first team meeting after the season was amazing
5568771 get a drink then come back lets go ten more minutes to go
5568772 this summers been the most focused ive seen the team coming into a preseason in my four years here
5568773 everyones so motivated after the way things went last year
5568774 it was like a different team than the team we saw during the regular season
5568775 things are looking good so far with the new guys
5568776 theyre coming along theyre doing a good job and they all have something to contribute
5568777 its not a type of music its a lifestyle for me
5568778 we try to get a really good cross section of life at carolina
5568779 ive never done any other dance like this where so many cultures come together
5568780 its like an ecstasy for me because i feel like when i dance i can just let go of all my problems
5568781 its nice to kind of feel connected to the university and have people watching every once in a while
5568782 you have to look poor as hell when you go on the floor said steve lin of raleigh
5568783 all the positions that you put your body in it ends up looking unreal
5568784 when americans win theyre heros sic when the chinese win theyre cheating commies
5568785 let the chicoms steal all the gold medals they can get i just want our government to stop allowing them to steal all our jobs
5568786 determining the degree of stenosis or how much the artery has narrowed is insufficient to predict patient risk
5568787 we know that the majority of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occur in patients whose blood vessels are less than 70 percent narrowed
5568788 patients with a reduction in gsm levels from their baseline ultrasound to the follow up ultrasound exhibited a significantly increased risk for near future adverse event compared to patients with increasing gsm levels
5568789 this technique will give us additional information to use in selecting patients that need aggressive treatment
5568790 increasing carotid plaque echolucency predicts cardiovascular events in high risk patients
5568791 since reports of erectile dysfunction ed incidence pathophysiology and treatment have shown a possible link between bph luts and ed pde5 inhibitors like tadalafil cialis have received increased attention for treating bph luts although they are currently only approved for ed the half life of tadalafil is 17 5 hours making it suitable as once daily therapy although the precise mechanism of action by which pde5 inhibitors may alleviate luts is not completely understood several putative mechanisms are currently under investigation
5568792 tadalafil administered once daily for lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia a dose finding study
5568793 there was a big bang and then a whole lot of smoke filled the room
5568794 i thought an electric box had exploded and called bianca davies shop owner
5568795 then some people put their head in asking if i was okay and i saw the car
5568796 we used to have this season from october to april where we had a chance for a storm
5568797 when you pull the storm track north it takes the storms with it
5568798 during the period its raining less it also tends to be warmer than it used to be
5568799 were starting to see the impacts of climate change in the late winter and early spring particularly in the southwest its a season specific kind of drought
5568800 were used to thinking about climate change as happening sometime in the future to someone else but this is right here and affects us now the future is here
5568801 its very rare that you get this distribution by chance
5568802 if people have that type of attitude there its stupid
5568803 everybody has issues and makes mistakes or has things to deal with its about turning the page and moving forward and concentrating on whats in front of you rather than concentrating on whats behind you
5568804 hes close to being ready for us which is great
5568805 he didnt intend for any of that to happen and certainly neither did we
5568806 hes never mailed it in he just hasnt stayed healthy so its been unfortunate for us
5568807 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5568808 evidently we didnt do enough work in the last 10 days
5568809 like i told them its my fault for trying to save them a little bit and not beat them up on the practice field so we came down here and got beat up in the game
5568810 as soon as we got back to practice amani showed me
5568811 hes the best in the business at that he knows just how to stay in even if he has to fall doing it
5568812 a hat trick in a quarter is not a bad night
5568813 as you saw we didnt play very good they outcoached us they outplayed us we were in it for a second
5568814 then we got too many penalties and penalties changed field position the first quarter basically was the game it was unbelievable
5568815 brit actress kate beckinsale has a fixation on her nether regions both front and back
5568816 damons been a stellar offense force and even jason giambi has managed to turn in a good season
5568817 the year created an atmosphere of change both politically and socially many african americans see the year as a defining moment in their history
5568818 at this time black america declared a new voice and new identity amid all of the crushing tragedies and strife
5568819 over the past two years the selected films have demonstrated the commonalities between african americans and other cultures
5568820 this fall the theme will explore the beliefs and traditions regarding race skin color and cultural identity
5568821 a part of the stone centers mission is to promote the critical examination of the african diaspora cultures through dialogue and debate
5568822 the fall programs will sustain that open dialogue and discussion about the african diaspora
5568823 if there was more support for the local music venues and probably art galleries and other stuff too that would help pass on opportunities to the local artists
5568824 some of the opportunities you have now that go straight to the artists maybe a few artists benefit from that but not the whole scene
5568825 the arts make a place a better place to live in so that attracts people to move here
5568826 so when artists leave in a sense its like the community is pulling the rug out from under itself
5568827 but just like with anything else a lot of resources that are available to people are underused
5568828 if a need exists then it is our job to fit the need
5568829 everyone is suffering from a lack of space including academics athletics campus recreation and student activities
5568830 we were lucky in that we could use an english department space for some practices
5568831 due to the nature of our work we were allowed to perform in wilson library which saved the day
5568832 we rehearsed in the lounges in the south campus dorms classrooms sorority houses outside in the quad whatever we could find
5568833 obviously physical activity is a different thing you cant just push the chairs aside in the classroom
5568834 improv classes teach you to improvise and the by product is that youre funny
5568835 we dont teach you jokes we teach you how to be on the stage with someone else
5568836 there was a demand for my class so they booked me to come back for a weekend a month later
5568837 what that says for the area is that i taught for a week with people in toronto ontario and my name and dsis name and by proxy chapel hill and carrboro are sort of on the map
5568838 i took dsi classes in high school and continued taking them through college
5568839 the things that i learned in those classes made it possible for me to get onto chips
5568840 the analogy that i like to use is that a jazz musician doesnt pick up a sax and do improv jazz by playing random notes
5568841 you have to learn the patterns so you can learn to improvise on them
5568842 its about progressing the action in a scene and taking baby steps together
5568843 the rules i learned in improv i live my life by it extends far beyond just performing on stage
5568844 i found it to be the case here that your individual attention is far greater
5568845 you get a far better experience and more attention from faculty members
5568846 you get graded on your work there and your lessons
5568847 so your teacher can tell whether you practiced that week or if you made bad decisions the night before
5568848 so sometimes i want other criticisms so my studio time is really helpful
5568849 we have an equal proportion of performing and academic faculty
5568850 that enables us to think about music at the same time as doing it
5568851 something thats been very new is that were being more cooperative with the boards of the other theater companies
5568852 you get to know a lot of these other people so you can work together to send people who are maybe more interested in straight theater to lab or elsewhere for example
5568853 it was harder on our board harder on actors and the orchestra and directors because it added that much more pressure
5568854 itll be good to know organizationally how to go about it
5568855 its an undeniable fact that with all the participation there are so many crossovers in the dramatic arts world that its impossible not to coordinate
5568856 not bare boned but streamlined shows that dont necessary need all the bells and whistles of a show in kenan theater
5568857 the repertory season is going to be brand new for lab and extremely unique to anything student related on campus
5568858 its a really great shift because all the groups have come together and there are a lot of people involved in multiple theater groups
5568859 i think honestly a lot of the students involved realized that there was not really any genuine benefit from being competitive or separate
5568860 we were certainly disappointed with our finish in the acc last year
5568861 the competition theyre playing in is vital and thats the only way to get better
5568862 theyve done that this summer and it will be a good help in the fall
5568863 coming back our players are really excited about the prospects
5568864 well be playing a very strong schedule and probably four or five top 20 teams just in the acc
5568865 my expectations are high after the summer that weve had weve proved that were capable of achieving great things
5568866 its just great to see so many of our swimmers doing personal best times
5568867 thats the key to motivation and wanting to come back
5568868 weve set up a rigorous and challenging dual meet schedule we wanted a little more national exposure to national competition
5568869 but that class was instrumental in working through those its a class that had a big impact
5568870 shes a tar heel all the way through and through she gave a lot of energy and enthusiasm to our swimmers and divers were actively seeking candidates to be considered for replacing her
5568871 we wanted a big and talented freshman class and we got it
5568872 sagar you are like me we are not religious we are spiritual
5568873 do not hesitate to insert the very word that we ought to be at pains to repudiate
5568874 the bullets came from all directions from the right and the left meanwhile i was crying out to god to send his angels to protect us and i saw the young people falling injured all around me and others managed to run for their lives
5568875 we are sure that the soldiers were guarding the killers or maybe they came with them so that the police would not be able to intervene they had to have known what was going on because they passed right in front of the center
5568876 his head was very bad his body was covered with blood i got close to him but he no longer had any reaction he stayed there a long time they were going to take him to a clinic but they never made it and they left him there
5568877 all we do is detox counseling we try to get people jobs
5568878 part of the plot as it said in the script was that this event would be used to start an international war on terror
5568879 in other sports like track and field its all timed and it doesnt have anything to do with the judges
5568880 im a little disappointed just knowing that i had the same exact score and thats what makes it a little harder to take
5568881 i didnt say anything to my dad at first i was just like am i that tired i know its been a long week
5568882 we started getting confused there was still a few more people to go we didnt want to hype things up when we didnt even know if we had a medal at that point
5568883 and im hoping to get that gold that i feel i missed out a little bit on today
5568884 posted by noob 1 32 pm mon aug 18 2008 why dont we whine about how it seems phelps was beat in one of his swims seriously we need more whining
5568885 if you have same average then the one with less standard deviation win simple statistics
5568886 shawn was tilted away from the vertical on bars and thats a 8 deduction
5568887 extraordinary routine from shawn the judges are not scoring her correctly
5568888 shawns starting value on beam will be lowered b c she didnt connect oh they didnt lower it thats a lucky break
5568889 the united states should not always complain about their loss asians on whole look much younger than their causcasian counterparts the fact the americans dont see that highlights their cultural ignorance im asian an im usually mistaken for 3 4 years my actual age
5568890 are thes readers really talking about cheating lol which country has a former olympian in jail for lying about doping in her 5 medals which country has a tour de france winnder stripped of the title for doping you dont have any room to cast stones funny you seem to forget that when you blast others with your accusations lol they dont have to accuse us athletes the world has already proven it now back up your accusations with something more than sour grapes

5568895 playing with the deck purposely stacked against them they have demonstrated incredible poise maybe one day the chinese will learn what sportsmanship is
5568896 the chinese are cheaters everyone knows it and the ioc is ignoring it the emporer has no clothes
5568897 is there any advantage for china to throw underage girls to compete mature and experienced american girls
5568898 dont be a bitter and sour grapes loser like karolyis did
5568899 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more

5568910 social media companies are always going to have to be careful about the conversations that go on their networks
5568911 slander illegal acts and copyright issues are all potential risks since user generated content is by nature unpredictable
5568912 there are a number of laws out there that can be potentially violated on a social networking site
5568913 people have gotten nailed and lost their jobs when it has been discovered what they said on online industry forums
5568914 lori drew is definitely an exception however it is conceivable if someone posts derogatory pictures or writes something that could for example keep someone from getting a job or getting into college that they could be brought to court
5568915 whenever we get cash infusion into gpss we have to prioritize the use of those monies

5568919 its important because its our way of respecting the dead
5568920 it is also a chance for the whole family from across the country to come together
5568921 level of objectivity has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5568922 we are concerned that your news division is following msnbcs lead in abandoning nonpartisan coverage of the presidential race
5568923 mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5568924 as an actor you really hope that you can get a big variety and its hard
5568925 its a money driven business its more secure to hire actors that you know they can deliver this and they can deliver that its harder to take chances understandably and i love that its a completely different genre i love that im playing arguably the most evil woman on the planet and i had a hoot every day at work
5568926 their reality is so different the place where theyre coming from
5568927 as the movie sort of explains prisons have turned into these corporations that are privately owned and theyre geared to make money and shes a very high powered sort of ceo in a lot of ways i think of this person and shes interested in the bottom line only and so its actually very fun to play somebody whos just completely evil
5568928 i had been posted to serbia and was writing about the nationalist atmosphere in the capital belgrade when i ran across an ethno musicologist named simonida who started talking about vampires
5568929 she told me that the popular image of the vampire the fanged creature who rises from the dead to suck the blood of the living had its origins in serbian folk tales and that she personally knew several vampires would i like to meet them i declined but her invitation fired my imagination
5568930 she wants to do a preliminary interview with torgu to see if he will make a good subject for a segment on her show known as the hour
5568931 when he turns out to be completely inappropriate for television and far more than just a mobster her business trip turns into a nightmare she has to outwit him to survive meanwhile back at the offices of the hour her disappearance is the first in a chain of mysterious events that come to panic and terrify a seasoned and cynical staff of journalists
5568932 i can remember having the feeling that the world was being remade in smoke and fire before my eyes
5568933 we will complete animation on coraline in about six weeks and plan a february release of 2009
5568934 it concerns itself with a primal thought every child considers i wish i had other parents that and the button eyes
5568935 the movie version of coraline is very faithful to the tone and the spirit of the book
5568936 in the translation from book to film there are adjustments to story and character that have to be made the main thing i always felt was i could not disappoint the readers of the book and though some details have been changed as well as the order of the sequences i feel we will be successful
5568937 there is no doubt that there are some similarities between the two projects
5568938 i also have many of the original nightmare team members working on coraline weve all grown and the visual aesthetic is ultimately a very different one youll see great animation like nightmare like a cousin of nightmare more like a second cousin the last thing id want to do would be to try to rip off a classic film i directed
5568939 it just gives you more of what is there just a little more sense of the reality of this medium
5568940 it does not live in the computer nor is it a series of drawings its an actual real set of puppets

5568964 paul hodes is well funded and will have the full support of nancy pelosi and the democratic national committee bosse said
5568965 its going to take more than talking points to beat him its going to take a clear consistent conservative message and im the only republican candidate who has one
5568966 bob clegg agrees with paul hodes on earmarks on opposing a border fence and on increasing health care mandates bosse said
5568967 how can he make the case against paul hodes in november
5568968 this is a real step backwards for him clegg said of bosse
5568969 i am disappointed he says i am with paul hodes he knows that is not the case and he is better than that

5568973 the settlement appropriately sanctions this company for the violations we uncovered

5568981 the depth of the malaise and the lack of the work out there for us is as bad as its ever been prouty said during a telephone interview
5568982 theres been a complete stop of new construction and also you have people afraid to spend money on anything but absolutely necessary repairs
5568983 i have had to lay men off i prided myself in 25 years of never having to do that we had people leave when work got slow but this time i had to actually let them go and that was very tough prouty said
5568984 i said thats a worthy goal to be set i would like to be part of that never dreaming i would be the one prouty said
5568985 what a great surprise we had a good chat for 10 minutes or so prouty said
5568986 its folks like you that really helped this campaign work
5568987 i had no problem from day one i dont understand that prouty said of clinton supporters reluctant to embrace obama
5568988 they were both trying to achieve the same goals i thought they were great candidates and i felt we won either way
5568989 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5568990 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5568991 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5568992 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5568993 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5568994 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from mexico youd think we would want to pay more attention

5569001 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5569002 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5569003 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5569004 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5569005 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5569006 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
5569007 we really want to get the message out to people
5569008 i got back the standard form letter thank you for your comment
5569009 who is supposed to be more on top of financial things than a bank but banks made all these terrible mortgage loans and caused these disruptions and we are dependent on them for our financial security
5569010 there are no new or increased federal or state excise taxes
5569011 theyre heavily concentrated in states where home prices are plummeting
5569012 could go down the street and get that loan somewhere else
5569013 it was pretty evident that the only thing that was supporting these loans was higher home prices

5569018 i believe mccain will be a better commander in chief than obama who also opposes gay marriage if we have an experienced seasoned person defending the country in this dangerous age we will be able to argue about the gay agenda later

5569029 i want to make very clear that the renewable energy target was a very clear election commitment to the australian people by the rudd labor government and its a commitment we will be meeting senator wong said in sydney
5569030 we believe it is important for the government to provide incentives to the market to invest in renewable energy so that future generations of australians have a range of clean energy options available to them she said
5569031 we remain committed to ensuring that 20 per cent of australias energy comes from renewable sources by 2020

5569051 thirty years ago 20 years ago we were the fruit pickers we were the cotton chippers we did all this rural work we were the unskilled labourers in the rural industry
5569052 we created a false economy and then people got used to the idea of staying at home rather than actually going out and looking for work he said
5569053 in other words the requirements that we will put in place will ensure that if there is an australian or someone based in australia who is ready willing and able to work in the horticulture industry then theyll get the jobs first he said macquarie radio in sydney
5569054 were going to review that pilot program halfway through to see whether its a success to whether the requirements weve put in place are working effectively mr smith said
5569055 and if it is successful to see whether it might be sensible to expand the capacity to other areas of australia or indeed to other countries in the pacific
5569056 yet for some inexplicable reason the labor party says the horticultural industry can have workers but the tourism industry cant he said
5569057 i wanted to play football for penn state for as long as i can remember
5569058 there were no guarantees when i came here but i would have been mad at myself if i didnt at least give it a shot
5569059 its definitely a big change from penns valley where i played in front of 1 500 or 2 000 people a game
5569060 here theres 110 000 people every game when i was a freshman i had to take a step back every once in a while i was in awe a little bit
5569061 but ive gotten used to it i know i belong here i just have go out on the field now and prove to people i belong here
5569062 it was devastating to lose a player like sean but we have to move on and get things done on the field without sean being there beside us
5569063 were going to be a little bit different team without sean in the middle
5569064 sean was a heck of a football player but weve got a good group of young linebackers to work with and josh is one of them
5569065 hes been around he understands what were trying to get done hes played for us in games he understands his role and what it takes to be a good player in there
5569066 he understands our system he just has to get used to playing full time
5569067 josh came here as a walk on and he earned peoples respect his first day
5569068 now he has a scholarship and hes going to be a starter
5569069 when you see stuff like that you have to be impressed hes certainly not a pushover he has a big heart and he brings it with him to work every day in practice
5569070 by helping our community we help our world and cnotes records vows to help our world
5569071 this gives the rba reserve bank of australia room for a loosening in monetary policy in response to the current weakening in domestic activity dr claus said in a statement
5569072 i was hoping to get it back for my first tuition payment
5569073 we made the decision to at least have custers last stand
5569074 we had to put a stop to the money that is going out
5569075 why have there been no terrorist attacks in the us since 9 11 2001
5569076 the actors motivations may be unclear and therefore difficult to label as terrorism
5569077 using images from arab tv rarely seen in the west obsession reveals an insiders view of the hatred the radicals are teaching their incitement of global jihad and their goal of world domination with the help of experts including first hand accounts from a former plo terrorist a nazi youth commander and the daughter of a martyred guerrilla leader the film shows clearly that the threat is real a peaceful religion is being hijacked by a dangerous foe who seeks to destroy the shared values we stand for the world should be very concerned
5569078 we must educate our children scroll down to video 924
5569079 since the attacks on september 11 2001 the middle east media research institute has monitored translated and recorded what was said in the arab and iranian press about that day
5569080 this program tonight is not about moderate muslims good pious peace loving people who despise the radicals
5569081 no matter how many times teachers told him to take them off he would still have them on
5569082 he was really a funny person him just smiling just kind of lit up your day
5569083 then all of a sudden back to back tragedies its really sad
5569084 he was really close to graduation he was on the right track and instantly he was gone
5569085 i remember her telling me deshaun got shot and killed and i said what
5569086 asttecs primary objective is to create an ecosystem and enable the channels to achieve a mass penetration for asterisktm
5569087 until the last minute he was in two minds facing a choice between fight and flight
5569088 this closure is to get this done before school starts
5569089 i said are we celebrating the independence or are we celebrating the resignation of musharraf
5569090 i think the general feeling was that it was time for him to move on
5569091 none of the dictators have left peacefully the transitions have never been so smooth its a clear victory for democracy
5569092 latest reminder of the perils of this administrations personality driven foreign policy that turned a blind eye to pakistans people
5569093 he was probably doing something for the country that was good all along
5569094 if something happens to him that could further destabilize the country
5569095 were making sure we have everything in place so that when we make a decision its going to be the right decision
5569096 i think the board would be open to any proposal which results in milford having an opportunity to secure large amounts of money now whether thats possible under this proposal or any proposal its too early to know
5569097 it seems to me that until theyre legal its certainly on the part of the developer a gamble to spend a great deal of time and money
5569098 i think its certainly something that milford and the milford area would need to weigh in on
5569099 most of them dont go anywhere but we have to look at each one in a fair manner
5569100 and at the end do whats in the best interests of all the people
5569101 to discuss real estate negotiations and to meet with counsel on verizon negotiations
5569102 to consider the purchase exchange lease or value of real property if an open discussion may have a detrimental effect on the negotiating position of the governmental body with a person firm or corporation
5569103 everything that was discussed absolutely fit the open meeting law
5569104 it may be and may be not thats the thing
5569105 to be safe we have to be as judicious as possible and we have to give that kind of confidentiality
5569106 until the school committee meets and takes formal action on the resignation i am not able to respond to those questions
5569107 its comparable to last year but it probably wont beat last year
5569108 the early summer got a jump start with the stimulus checks from the federal government and the end of the summer got a nice finish with the sales tax holiday
5569109 normally people dont get motivated to do back to school shopping until labor day i think it likely gave back to school sellers a jump start on the season
5569110 all in all i think its going to be a successful weekend i guess the real bottom line is if you compare what this past weekend would have been like if we had not had the sales tax holiday and it would have been an abysmal month
5569111 i can tell you our traffic was up and when id talk to customers and say you know you dont have to pay tax on that theyd get this smile on their face and theyd say oh yeah we know we were busy all weekend
5569112 we had everything from 3 items to 1 300 items
5569113 i havent run the numbers in comparison to last year but i can tell you it was definitely a good year for us weve been doing ok but that little kick to spur the economy it definitely paid off
5569114 everybody was saying i could buy that guitar but i should really be thinking responsibly about groceries and things like that
5569115 but they said what the hell i can just take a little bit of a hit now because i know im going to save some dough
5569116 we had plenty of frames and bikes go out that were more than 1 000 and less than 2 500 it was great
5569117 youve got to remember we are a way to save
5569118 a bike is a way to save ive commuted by bike most days since may ive got over 1 500 in savings in gas
5569119 the asia pacific consulting marketplace 2008 2011 key trends profiles and forecasts
5569120 even in 2005 interest in the apac region was driven primarily by opportunistic servicing of growing domestic consulting demand in each market and the wish to support global clients in their endeavors in asia pacific
5569121 today a much larger group of firms has moved toward an overall strategic interest in the apac region such interest is unsurprising for the it consulting space since offshore outsourcing links have already been playing an important role in that area more surprising is how strategic interest is very quickly coming to play across the whole consulting landscape
5569122 we will pursue and take aggressive actions against the perpetrators of these dastardly acts against innocent civilians
5569123 we will continue with the operations it will not stop with the clearing of the areas occupied by them
5569124 we cannot forever take the convenient excuse from the hierarchy of a group that is supposedly talking peace with the government
5569125 it is their responsibility if they are really sincere and well meaning to rein in their forces
5569126 its hard not to live in the moment and for me at the moment i havent been able to get what i want out of footy
5569127 so at the moment im sort of frustrated i have been frustrated by what has happened this year
5569128 but my career as a whole has been really successful
5569129 i was waking up and not really looking forward to playing footy as i had in previous years and you just get the feeling it is time
5569130 were working both sides of this and in the end our kids need things from us our taxpayers need us to be sensitive and all i can say is we tried every step of putting these recommendations together to be responsive on both fronts
5569131 we went in to this whole process knowing that there was the delicate balance between our community and a tough economy and of course keeping support for our students and staff in our schools
5569132 this is something every single one of us can do without sacrificing anything
5569133 just lighten up turn the lead in your right foot into gold in your pocket
5569134 were not really eager to embrace mandates but it has turned out that its not possible to drive 55 on the roadways because so many people are speeding around at 80 or 85 miles per hour
5569135 if you want to drive slower drive in the right hand lane the faster traffic can go by on the left hand side
5569136 there comes a point in time in the summer when for kids they say ive gone through my summer camps ive gone through the little league season swimming vacations and theyre ready to see their friends theyre ready to be around adults that they trust and that they know and start another school year
5569137 it would typically be around this time for a couple of reasons
5569138 most of our students are already on campus for some type of extra curricular whether its the football program or volleyball so theyre here on campus to begin with so we simply extended that out and started school at the same time
5569139 so we have the opportunity if it makes sense to start in advance
5569140 for us it allows us to get our full semesters work done before the holiday break so when our students are done in december they get two full weeks off without studying for exams and come back refreshed and ready to go for the second semester
5569141 i think that does contribute to higher student performance not having that gap in there
5569142 it was a change that was made without any educational policy reason for it
5569143 it was done primarily for economic reasons to benefit the summer economy of the state
5569144 the question is is that best preparing our students for global economics best preparing the wisconsin economy for the future
5569145 we have the opportunity and were thankful for that to make the decision for what works best for us for our kids their families and for the education that were trying to provide
5569146 we think that local school boards are in the best position theyre closest to their communities to know whats best for their children and the community
5569147 i will tell people every year that one of my favorite days is this day because the faculty and staff and students breathe a vitality into this building thats undeniable
5569148 six people dead this summer fifteen since 2003 its time to try something different
5569149 just like an absentee ballot you get your ballot you vote at home you turn it back in
5569150 in this process that currently exists youre talking about incredible amounts of coercion and intimidation right before the voting starts
5569151 shes extremely uncomfortable shes been reminded shes the suburban mom

5569169 the walls of john smethers barstow house are lined with antique civil war history books volumes from psychologist carl jung copies of his own recently published book on the psychology of drug addicts and his greatest source of pride a doctorate degree from pacifica graduate institute its not the typical setting of a recovered drug addict with a pages long rap sheet
5569170 federal health minister tony clement says ethical concerns raised by supervised injection sites for drug addicts are
5569171 is it ethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5569172 once mainly used to treat heroin addiction methadone is being prescribed by family doctors osteopaths and nurse practitioners for some types of severe pain methadone a synthetic form of opium is powerful cheap and long lasting unfortunately while it has helped millions methadone is also widely abused and poorly prescribed by physicians because of this methadone is now the fastest growing cause of narcotic deaths is implicated in more than twice as many deaths as heroin and is equaling or exceeding oxycontin and vicodin in negative responses
5569173 after recovery of a huge quantity of intoxicating drugs was seized from the chemist shop of state president of bahujan samaj party bsp avtar singh karimpuri in hoshiarpur the bahujan samaj morcha monday asked the party chief to quit his post on moral grounds
5569174 the fda is considering making a recommendation that doctors get special education to prescribe strong narcotics despite the fact that it has no power to enforce such a proposal fda officials say theyre most concerned about high potency long acting narcotics like methadone fentanyl and some forms of oxycodone in particular theyve noted that a mix of methadone and fentanyl patches has been associated with patient deaths and injuries from doctor misprescribing or accidental patient misuse

5569188 im big on student success student results and im just looking forward to meeting all the students
5569189 in a nutshell that would be what i would require to vote to approve that
5569190 what we are presenting here is basically a new facility being located primarily where the old courthouse sits now
5569191 the changes we make now are the least expensive they are ever going to be in the entire process
5569192 some books state that raffles was born on 5 july 1781
5569193 we have a lot of homeless people out here and where are they going to go
5569194 what are they going to do hide you put you in jail until the convention is over
5569195 where are we going to hide our homeless during the convention the short answer we dont hide the homeless ever

5569200 its a relief and now its just all about the unit and knowing what everybodys going to do and just kind of tailoring things to the way that we like it
5569201 there were a whole string of events in this sorry tale
5569202 these resulted in a scandalous saga that overshadowed the athens games
5569203 he cost me gold his antics put me off and i found it very difficult to refocus
5569204 but i have to say its not an example of putting country first when you say president george bushs economic policies have shown great progress
5569205 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now maybe you havent noticed
5569206 in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5569207 it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5569208 for my part with so much in the balance it was an easy call as i said at the time i would rather lose an election than lose a war
5569209 even in retrospect obama would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5569210 i have worked a lot to get the women to have fun
5569211 for them fencing was a kind of a job it was not a passion
5569212 when i saw the people responsible at the federation after we won silver they didnt even congratulate me they care only about gold
5569213 the logic here is if two hours training is good four must be better if you can do eight hours then 12 is better still
5569214 going on 10 000m training runs doesnt make you a better basketball player
5569215 their advanced training methods and new concepts helped the chinese athletes improve their performances at the olympics
5569216 they pay good money big money i wouldnt help them for nothing
5569217 strengthening is expected tonight and tuesday and fay is forecast to be at or near hurricane strength winds of 119 kilometers or 74 miles per hour as it approaches the southwestern coast of florida
5569218 tornadoes are likely in some areas tonight monday and tomorrow and maybe even into the next few days
5569219 even though this storm doesnt look like its very dangerous and people will say its just a tropical storm or its just a category one hurricane our experience with florida tells us that if were not careful we will lose people
5569220 we have amazing waves today something not seen very often on this beaches its a perfect day
5569221 i came out with as little effort as possible i felt comfortable i just wanted to win the heat with as little effort as possible and just not take any chances
5569222 i like to see where im at why she looks at the screen and not slow down too much
5569223 i was pretty mad but i had to get over it
5569224 it was pretty good always work the beginning and if i had to go go but not too much
5569225 i feel pretty good i think everybody is a little sluggish it was just one of those days
5569226 im glad i finally got that first race out of the way
5569227 it wasnt as bad as i dreamed it would be i got out there and it was just like any other meet just dont look at the third level of the stadium seating
5569228 the russian side is gravely violating the conditions provided for by the peace accord signed by the presidents of georgia france and the russian federation
5569229 we will do whatever is necessary and no one should have any illusion
5569230 everywhere i go people have told me im getting nervous
5569231 i have to just remind people that it is true that just as john mccain has embraced george bushs policies hes embraced his politics and the same people who brought you george bush are now trying to package john mccain
5569232 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5569233 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5569234 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than a fair share and wreck the earth even more
5569235 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened
5569236 do you know know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5569237 it might be good for your asian and african childrens self esteem to know you support a brown man for the leader of the free world
5569238 they always have a segment to do the handover to showcase the next city to host the olympics
5569239 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5569240 we see this as a real opportunity to start altering the cost model to deliver it
5569241 one tries on and discards shoes suits and swimwear so why not partners until one finds the right one
5569242 no permitiremos que rusia dibuje una nueva l nea de separaci n en los estados que a n no est n integrados en la estructura transat ntica como georgia desconoce lo que los ministros de exteriores decidir n en la reuni n extraordinaria pero s adelant que hablar n
5569243 but i believe js and others have made their own by looking at the adapter card header 0 pin out and some perfboard its pretty easy to make actually just pay attention to which controller you are using and wire accordingly the stk500 schematics are in the avrstudio help files
5569244 the help files in studio are priceless in this sort of thing
5569245 me siento muy bien es cierto que no he iniciado el torneo con mi equipo pero vengo de hacer una pretemporada muy fuerte lo cual me hace sentir en buenas condiciones al igual que mis otros compa eros estoy con muchas ansias de empezar la eliminatoria con el pie derecho y para eso el equipo debe aprovechar que estaremos de locales
5569246 conozco a varios de sus jugadores que actualmente juegan en el extranjero y por tal motivo reconozco que ser complicado este partido sin embargo hay que tomar en cuenta que todos los partidos de las eliminatorias son complicados es por eso que s lo debemos enfocarnos en quedarnos con los tres puntos en casa
5569247 obviamente es dif cil trabajar as porque no estamos completos pero la gran responsabilidad es la misma para sacar un buen resultado pues aunque no hemos trabajado con el t cnico cada uno de nosotros los jugadores sabemos lo que debemos hacer y complementarlo con el funcionamiento que pretende el entrenador
5569248 estamos tranquilos antes de cada partido se pueden decir muchas cosas pero nosotros preferimos demostrar que haremos mejor las cosas dentro de la cancha
5569249 ser un partido muy interesante que tendremos que ganar es una eliminatoria y es importante no dejar ir puntos
5569250 honduras ser un equipo fuerte que jugar muy ordenado le apostar a los contragolpes y aprovechar situaciones de contraataque por lo que debemos hacer un partido muy inteligente ya que ambos buscamos ganar
5569251 creo que esta selecci n dar de que hablar trabajaremos para que as sea y nos adecuaremos a lo que venga hay jugadores de calidad para hacer las cosas bien daremos mucho de qu hablar motiva ser parte de un grupo que ha logrado cosas importantes y que quiere trascender vengo para estar con la selecci n y espero que el trabajo pueda rendir llego bastante bien f sicamente al cien por ciento y muy motivado creo que se ha hablado del poco tiempo de trabajo pero no habr pretexto para hacer un buen partido
5569252 todo est bien hemos tenido una buena pretemporada y llegamos en buena forma
5569253 tenemos que convencer del buen futbol que tienen muchos compa eros m os y demostrar que podemos unirnos bien para conseguir un gran resultado todos no s lo los que juegamos fuera todos vamos a poner el nombre de m xico en alto es dif cil ya que no hay tiempo para prepararnos pero nos conocemos desde hace mucho tiempo y eso podr a ser una ventaja
5569254 yo digo que no es tan f cil hacer cien goles y m s en esta divisi n pero significa mucho para m es una alegr a indescriptible el saber que tambi n comparten conmigo mucha gente que no est n mi familia que est mi pap mi mam y mis hermanos que est n en argentina tambi n mi cu ado y mi hermana que donde est n yo creo que deben estar contentos porque la verdad que eso es lo que quer an de mi de llegar al f tbol mexicano tratar de hacer las cosas bien ellos siempre confiaron en mi es algo muy triste y contento a la vez triste porque me hubiera gustado compartirlo con ellos con m nica y con pablo y contento porque yo creo que ellos quer an eso de mi ellos siempre apuntaron de que pod a jugar en el f tbol mexicano ellos fueron los que me trajeron entonces contento por todo esto
5569255 tambi n me toc marcar dos goles pero uno siempre recuerda no todos los goles porque es muy dif cil pero goles lindos me ha tocado hacer en irapuato en san luis ac es el primer gol que hago desde que estoy en veracruz entonces tambi n es como algo muy lindo para uno el poder concretar el poder demostrar que puedo seguir jugando entonces eso muy importante para m
5569256 la verdad que hay tres uno con irapuato que me toc tambi n hacerle a zacatepec de chilenita pero los m s importantes de todo estos son los que me toc hacer con irapuato en las finales contra le n para ascender en el 2003 2004 y despu s cuando me toc marcar en el san luis quer taro el gol de la final que nos dio el pase para poder ascender a primera divisi n
5569257 hiciste una pregunta muy importante yo s que lo que estoy pidiendo no se puede cumplir cambiar a estos cien goles por poder estar otra vez con mi cu ado pablo hern n g mez y con mi hermana m nica que ellos estuvieran presente cambiar a much simas cosas no solamente los cien goles sabemos que no puede ser as uno sigue trabajando uno siempre los tiene presente a ellos que es lo importante que uno no se olvida ni de mi hermana ni de mi cu ado

5569262 son manejados por un grupo de abogados que adrede les informan mal
5569263 queremos dar soluci n al justo reclamo de estos pueblos porque el gobierno sigue actuando con mucha arrogancia y no tiene capacidad de di logo
5569264 el problema de fondo es que el gobierno intenta ver a los ind genas como unos pobres m s sin admitir que tienen otra manera de vivir una visi n cultural distinta
5569265 no tienen que ser vistos como seres inferiores por no permitir el ingreso de inversiones privadas a sus territorios lo que pasa es que al per le cuesta ver la diferencia cultural como un valor una riqueza la ven como un obst culo
5569266 algunas organizaciones no gubernamentales que est n trabajando en el tema est n levantando a la gente para que haga este tipo de cosas que en el fondo es un acto subversivo porque se est n yendo contra los cimientos de la democracia

5569286 thirty years ago 20 years ago we were the fruit pickers we were the cotton chippers we did all this rural work we were the unskilled labourers in the rural industry
5569287 we created a false economy and then people got used to the idea of staying at home rather than actually going out and looking for work he said
5569288 in other words the requirements that we will put in place will ensure that if there is an australian or someone based in australia who is ready willing and able to work in the horticulture industry then theyll get the jobs first he said macquarie radio in sydney
5569289 were going to review that pilot program halfway through to see whether its a success to whether the requirements weve put in place are working effectively mr smith said
5569290 and if it is successful to see whether it might be sensible to expand the capacity to other areas of australia or indeed to other countries in the pacific
5569291 yet for some inexplicable reason the labor party says the horticultural industry can have workers but the tourism industry cant he said
5569292 we need some clear and specific policy parameters before the opposition can determine whether or not we will support this

5569326 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5569327 on these considerations a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5569328 all they are really saying here is that if they dont move towards less restrictive conditions the risk of a deeper or more persistent slowing of the economy would increase
5569329 they dont want that which is an argument to cut rates but by the same token the language is not strong enough to suggest they are heading towards a 50 basis point cut next month
5569330 given the slower trend in demand scope to move towards a less restrictive setting of monetary policy was judged to be increasing
5569331 while board members didnt consider a rate cut at the august meeting its clear that they wanted it on the agenda at the next meeting
5569332 it was likely that the headline rate of inflation would rise further in the immediate future but the softer demand outlook meant that inflation was still forecast to decline during 2009 and to be consistent with the target during 2010
5569333 the rba board was clearly caught between the opposing policy needs of fighting high inflation and dealing with a growth slowdown with the potential to go too far

5569349 weve had cases here in evansville such as at the ppg plant where employees were intimidated and scared out of being able to freely choose union or not we need a president who respects the freedom of all employees to form unions and to do so in a safe environment barack obama voted for the employee free choice act and hell fight for that freedom
5569350 most workers would choose to be in a union if they felt it could happen without intimidation denying employees that freedom not only hurts them but it hurts all working people and the entire middle class

5569352 i want to talk about for a minute about an imaginary family
5569353 this imaginary family lives in raytown the father of this family got laid off from a union job the mother of this family is a teacher they dont have a big income
5569354 one of them is headed off to college next year and when he had that union job they were able to save a little bit for college they hadnt given a lot of thought about how washington impacts them and how jefferson city impacts them
5569355 they try to take care of their parents they honestly believed their kids were going to do a little bit better than they did they thought theyd be able to see a doctor when they were sick they thought that if they worked hard and played by the rules that their kids would be able to go to college they thought their children would be able to get jobs and be able to send their kids to college every year it would get a little better
5569356 their kids used to be on schip and had health insurance now they cant because we congress decided we cant even provide health insurance for working families
5569357 all of a sudden for the first time in america this family is making less today

5569395 all of obamas misrepresentations and contradictions on this issue have one common goal to obscure the position he actually articulated and acted on in 2001 through 2003
5569396 neither the original version of the legislation nor the final state version that obama killed in 2003 contained any language to protect babies before the point of live birth
5569397 the obama of 2001 2003 really did object to a bill merely because it defended the proposition a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law and it is that reality that he now desperately wants to conceal from the eyes of the public

5569420 we dont know what we want weve never defined our goals or values or passions so were out of touch with our hearts desires and our growing responsibilities have numbed us to the possibilities around us and the passions within us
5569421 spontaneity is an underappreciated dimension of our spirituality in fact spiritual maturity has less to do with long range visions than it does with moment by moment sensitivity to the promptings of the holy spirit and it is our moment by moment sensitivity to the holy spirit that turns life into an everyday adventure
5569422 it seems to me that the people god uses the most are those who make the fewest assumptions joshua didnt assume that the sun could not stand still elisha didnt assume that an iron ax head cannot float mary didnt assume that virgins cannot get pregnant peter didnt assume that he could not walk on water and jesus didnt assume that dead people cannot be raised to life again
5569423 we cant appreciate the full extent of gods grace until we realize the full extent of our sin
5569424 nothing is as freeing as confessed sin nothing is as isolating as a guilty secret and that is why the enemy wants you to keep your sins a secret if you keep your sins a secret you will be trapped in the cage of guilt the rest of your life the only way out is confession and i dont just mean confession to god
5569425 god is far more concerned about your future than you are
5569426 ive come to realize that getting where god wants me to go isnt nearly as important as becoming who god wants me to be in the process and god seems to be far less concerned with where im going than with who im becoming i think some of us want to know the will of god more than we want to know god
5569427 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here

5569433 the hurricane season is still a major issue as seen in 2005 with katrina we have to be mindful of that
5569434 we have to watch how it all plays out where the u s dollar would go and where the stocks market is
5569435 how can a book this short drag on for this long
5569436 economic growth has been sluggish against the backdrop of high energy and material prices and weaker growth in exports
5569437 here is the bar where i used to get swedish fish for a penny a piece on sundays even though by law it shouldnt have been open the lights and television were always on super low and the neon beer signs outside werent lit to make it seem like it was closed if you were just walking by
5569438 this is where i watched my brother hit homeruns in little league and was even a cheerleader for a couple years when i was six seven years old i probably still have that green and gold uniform with the big a on the front of the shirt somewhere this is also the field where we played tackle football in the winter in the snow
5569439 right there there used to be an old rickety wooden house that creaked and swayed in the wind on tuesday evenings the fire company used it for practice but on other summer nights my cousin and i used to sit on the merry go round at the adjacent playground and watch the house for hours absolutely sure that we saw something moving in the sheer curtains in the upstairs window
5569440 this is where we used to go to pick berries and look for arrowheads and rocks especially quartz and swim in big ole stripmining holes that are now filled with the most gorgeous blue water yes its quite dangerous but its like an initiation rite for a coal region kid
5569441 deutschland wird pakistan auch in zukunft bei der entwicklung des landes und der festigung der demokratie zur seite stehen
5569442 pr sident musharraf ist ein freund der vereinigten staaten gewesen und einer der engagiertesten partner im kampf gegen terrorismus und extremismus
5569443 ich hoffe nun zieht politische stabilit t in pakistan ein
5569444 i am confident of winning a majority and the game will be played in the house
5569445 at the official level there will be no direct impact as pakistans civilian government has not said anything against the composite dialogue process that started in 2004
5569446 however there is anxiety as to how the autonomous factors in pakistan including those responsible for the kabul embassy attack respond
5569447 will they the autonomous factors step up anti india movements who will control the isi inter services intelligence agency the anxiety will remain unless clarity is reached in pakistan about the relation between the army and the civilian government and between the army and these autonomous factors
5569448 musharraf had become irrelevant to the peace process as a civilian government is in place
5569449 in the long run dealing with a civilian government in pakistan is in indias best interest
5569450 musharraf was a little more pragmatic than his predecessors if we look at his exit purely from viewpoint of its bearing on the kashmir issue its bad news for india
5569451 moreover we dont know how long will the unity between asif zardari co chairman of pakistan peoples party and nawaz sharif head of pakistan muslim league nawaz last it also remains to be seen how stable this coalition will be
5569452 in such a situation there is every chance that kashmir will become an issue in party politics with each side trying to outdo the other by more hawkish postures on kashmir
5569453 musharraf was a little more reasonable on kashmir but his formulations were something india could not accept
5569454 the peace process is also likely to slow down due to domestic political preoccupations in pakistan
5569455 we dont really know who is in control and whether they can rein in forces inimical to indian interests
5569456 india will not interfere in pakistans internal affairs relationship with pakistan is not individual specific
5569457 i dont want to interpret on the internal politics of any country but we desire there should always be peace in our neighbourhood
5569458 india will continue to have an amicable relation with pakistan in the days to come
5569459 of course a composite indo pak dialogue had progressed during the tenure of president musharraf and we are hopeful to continue it in future also
5569460 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan this is an internal matter of pakistan
5569461 whether he is impeached or not is not important from the indian point of view it is for the people of pakistan to decide
5569462 but it leaves a big vacuum and we are deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on pak afghan border but clearly on our side of the border too
5569463 no solution to the kashmir issue other than merger with pakistan
5569464 we are pakistanis and pakistan is us because we are tied with the country through islam
5569465 do you have faith in my leadership i will be faithful to you till my death and will carry everyone along
5569466 we ask india to start a dialogue over kashmir open the srinagar muzaffarabad road for trade and release all kashmiris in indian jails

5569525 when the bilateral agreements were debated everybody talked about wage dumping but no one thought about the impact on the rental market
5569526 but it has put a lot of pressure on rents
5569527 landlords are now taking more and more apartments out of the general market to provide more expensive accommodation furnished and with services to these new people who can afford to pay more
5569528 zurich is a rich city but there are still many people who need to find low rental prices they are now in trouble because it is becoming very difficult to find it
5569529 if it continues like this then it will become difficult for essential workers like nurses and police officers to live here

5569543 all they are really saying here is that if they dont move towards less restrictive conditions the risk of a deeper or more persistent slowing of the economy would increase
5569544 they dont want that which is an argument to cut rates but by the same token the language is not strong enough to suggest they are heading towards a 50 basis point cut next month

5569588 admitted sole responsibility for his actions by and in his guilty plea to the criminal assault charge against him
5569589 factually unfounded and legally impermissible for bertuzzi to now seek to transfer any of the responsibility for his actions

5569708 level of objectivity has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to ubsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5569709 we are concerned that your news division is following msnbcs lead in abandoning nonpartisan coverage of the presidential race
5569710 with all due respect to the campaign leadership they are viewing our coverage through a political prism
5569711 we stand by our reporting our journalism and our journalists

5569713 can you do it its a bit rougher this time
5569714 ultimately the interpretation of what constitutes religious matters should be left to the leaders and adherents of the faith
5569715 the home ministry is not in a position to dictate to the catholics or for that mater the proponents of any other faith the scope o f their religion
5569716 in seeking to control the contents of the herald the home ministrys warning and show cause letters go against article 3 1 article 10 1 a and article 11 3 a of the federal constitution that is the right to freely practise ones religion the general freedom of speech and expression and the right of a religious group to manage its own affairs
5569717 such controls will deprive the catholic community of current information and education in relation to their faith such an act by the authorities is tantamount to curtailment of religious freedom
5569718 when a question is asked you answer it and you try to answer it correctly thats the way he felt and he expressed that some people cant take it some people dont understand what hes talking about he has never backed down from what he said people laughed at him when he said they would win the nl east and then as the season continued on everybody started getting excited about it jimmy is a good friend of mine its sad that he has to go through something like this but im sure hell pull himself out of it and they will get that win streak and hopefully be in the world series
5569719 brians going to play at running back and theres not really much room for a lot of other guys to play

5569722 i like that it would be nice to have that thing or experience

5569729 ive gone through a lot of things and i have the support of my teammates it feels good to be back on the field just around the guys im back at home its definitely been a big weight lifted off me
5569730 i was kind of pessimistic how my teammates would receive me
5569731 there were a lot of rumors i admitted to my teammates i created a lot of those rumors at the time coach reid didnt know the truth people were saying it was really about his contract didnt want to play football anymore and i admit that i created those rumors just out of a lot of frustration and didnt care what people thought
5569732 they really didnt know you have a guy whos quick tempered whos to the point where i really didnt care anymore thats not the real me i just didnt realize what i was going through a few weeks ago was the first time ive ever opened up to anybody about anything that was part of the reason
5569733 coach reid after he realized that shawn andrews did have a serious problem he was very positive about the situation hes a funny guy he helps you laugh tries to make the situation better
5569734 it wasnt that i was trying to get out of work
5569735 i know there are great fans but there are also people and i will say i read message boards and got caught up in that whole thing and that even put more stress on me just worrying about what people thought about me people say a lot of times well i dont care what people say about me me personally i dont care about how people perceive me when they look at my hair but i like for people to think great things about shawn andrews but you cant please the world
5569736 it feels great ive gone through a lot of things and i have the support of my teammates it feels good to be back out on the field around the guys
5569737 im very confident if theres anybody that doubts me nobody shows it theres nothing but support here thats the good thing about the organization they do a great job of getting good character guys here i feel back at home
5569738 the last week its been pretty tough i was kind of pessimistic as to how my teammates would receive me back its been tough im still going through a lot but im just trying to make it its been a big step for me
5569739 i dont want to go too far in depth but there were a lot of rumors like i said i admitted to my teammates that i created a lot of those rumors at the time coach reid didnt know there were people saying contract didnt want to play anymore and i admit that i created those rumors out of a lot of frustration and i didnt care what people thought
5569740 yeah because they really didnt know you have a guy whos quick tempered who is now to the point where he really didnt care anymore that wasnt the real me i just didnt realize what i was going through a few weeks ago was the first time i ever opened up to anybody about anything that was part of the reason
5569741 it did make me feel comfortable coach reid after he realized that shawn andrews did have a serious problem he was very positive about the situation hes a funny guy i mean he helps you laugh and tries to make the situation better but ultimately he really showed that he cared and that meant a lot to me
5569742 i did hear about that i think it was his rookie year and his second year going through basically what im going through
5569743 being that im getting help now and im opening up more its definitely been a big weight lifted off of me i can stay prayed up about the situation and just know the difference of when i walk onto the field and try to compose myself because ive always felt alone after opening up to a couple people i definitely feel like i better know how to handle the situation
5569744 i would love to play against the patriots i mean it feels good to be back and around my teammates you dont get that camaraderie in too many other places
5569745 ive been running very hard and have used some of my emotions and aggressions in my workouts this morning i weighed in at 331 pounds and im feeling pretty strong thats lighter than what im going to play at on game day i just want to keep reassuring myself that i have the means and the mindset to keep the weight off
5569746 i guess now that ive spoken about my issues or my clinical depression if you will i think it really lifted a weight off of me because i received so many letters and emails good and bad but i just pay attention to the good ones and the people that i inspire that let me know that
5569747 it was actually it wasnt the day until my appointment to see my doctor back in arkansas because all of the people that were close to me my mentor who ive known for nine years who ive never opened up to he basically came to my house people coming to my house unannounced to get me out and to talk and to see whats going on because i was in my room talking to people just thinking they were very concerned and i was on the edge things werent going well so i felt like i must open up before its too late
5569748 i wont say that i contemplated suicide but i had some very i guess in my mind to me unrealistic thoughts about a lot of things i was really lost and just really felt like there was no outlet i know theres my mom there but i want the rest of her life to be worry free so i try and keep everything from her i just felt alone you know
5569749 ive received a lot of phone calls from public figures and people who have gone through what im going through ive also learned that among african american men and really men period we just hold things in whether its a football player or a man you are still like im a man nothing bothers me but if you internalize it it has to come out somewhere people question my silliness but im a fun loving guy being around people i dont care what creed you are it just ignites my silliness youll never know if im hurting on the inside i found out
5569750 ive actually thought about that im still kind of debating in my mind i know they are great fans but there are also people i will say for a minute that i read message boards and got caught up in that whole thing that even put more stress on me just worrying about what people thought about me people say a lot of times i dont care what people think about me me personally i dont care how people perceive me when they look at my hair but i like people to think great things about shawn andrews but you cant please the world
5569751 i am very confident that things will work out im not a religious man im spiritual i think a lot of it has to do with god having a calling on my life sometimes it takes bad things to wake you up and realize that god wants you to be who he wants you to be
5569752 there were a lot of things going through my mind first and foremost it was just good to get back with my fellow offensive linemen the kind of fun that we have i really missed it and just being in the huddle with donovan he is a very charismatic guy and it kind of helps for that moment to take away the issues in your mind it was just refreshing a beautiful day
5569753 it was old times i wasnt in there anticipating it i was just out there and wherever they got me to thats kind of how it went
5569754 coach reid allowed me some time after one of the team meetings to address my teammates i just felt like it was something that i needed to slash had to do because of the way that i just disappeared like i said the things i said that conveyed to them that i didnt want to be here anymore or whatever thoughts were in their minds i just wanted to let them know that it wasnt that i was trying to get out of work im no stranger to hard work i just wanted them to know that i hope they still respect me if they dont im going to do everything possible to gain the respect back
5569755 we doen ontzettend veel voor die groepen als gebruikers van onze instellingen maar niet in ons personeelsbestand
5569756 maar nog slechts 5 procent er zijn kindercr ches in de steden met tot 45 verschillende nationaliteiten onder de kindjes maar met maar 1 werknemer met allochtone roots
5569757 de overdreven diplomavereisten die de overheid oplegt als subsidievoorwaarde zijn een belangrijke rem de gebrekkige taalkennis van kandidaten ook maar dat betekent niet dat het niet anders kan we g n dat veranderen
5569758 how the purses are just for fun and i she doesnt want to be a
5569759 hes the last of a breed of collegiate athletes that have done it the right way and this is his reward he didnt get off to the greatest of starts but as the whole world now knows very few people can close a race like walt
5569760 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5569761 i have some other things obligations that ive got to do
5569762 i dont care if im rich or not ill still be in a paddle boat making fun of your yacht
5569763 there are only two options here hes either dead or someone got him
5569764 i believe local residents would have called us in a heartbeat if they would have seen him
5569765 our presence was ominous there were helicopters airplanes everything we could throw at it
5569766 thats the only other thing i could see there may be other opinions but thats mine when you cant turn up a body warm or or cold the case remains open
5569767 we are about the same hiring wise as we are every year
5569768 we have had applicants for every job but not as many for science as we do for social studies we lost one pennsylvania teacher with a long commute because he got a job in his home state
5569769 if a young man or woman is old enough to vote and represent our country through military service they should be informed enough to make mature decisions regarding consumption of alcohol nonetheless we will continue to enforce all applicable state and federal laws miller said but lowering the drinking age he noted would not be a greenlight for students to binge drink its not an issue of allowing them to drink its an issue of teaching responsible behaviors as part of them becoming responsible adults in our society
5569770 alcohol education needs to begin at home as a student is maturing from adolescence to adulthood it is less about a new innovative approach than about lifelong learning and responsible behavior
5569771 aber auch wenn ich eher ein einzelg nger bin in den dschungel geh ich nicht allein meine frau ramona soll mit sein
5569772 es geht noch um die gage j rgen muss ein dutzend auftritte absagen
5569773 man hat immer die kameras im kopf mit einem nacktbad im regenwald teich habe ich aber kein problem und ramona wird sich auch nicht hinter steinen verstecken
5569774 youre just such a wet blanket such a fuddy duddy you never want to go out and have a good time
5569775 we are here in a country where were not related to anyone
5569776 but all you want to do is to write your daily reckonings paint shutters and work on your various projects you know perfectly well you actually enjoy going out but you dont like being interrupted and i feel like im interrupting you or imposing on you whenever i want to invite people over
5569777 its just not a very pleasant way for us to live together were at odds i know you have different ideas about how to live but this is an important issue were going to be here i guess for the rest of our lives the children are leaving its just going to be the two of us and were going to be pretty lonely if we dont have friends in the area
5569778 all men stand up shift from where you are now down to the next row of tables
5569779 oh he died 4 years ago in a car accident
5569780 i am not into politics for the sake of posts or power but for the satisfaction and peace of mind god has given me popularity and money it cant tempt me
5569781 hence my first public meeting is being organised on august 26 her birth anniversary i will speak how her life inspired me and what i want to do
5569782 no es encerrando al vecino como se convence uno del buen sentido propio
5569783 me disgraziato quelle gambe che dovevano tradirmi mi offrivano la salvezza e mi tocca invece morire proprio per colpa di quello in cui riponevo tutta la mia fiducia
5569784 theres a deal for the director to helm a third picture but he has yet to decide on whether to tackle it yet
5569785 we have no idea where chris is going with this we havent had any conversations with him about it
5569786 now this whole musharraf excuse is behind us now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5569787 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5569788 i am going with the satisfaction that whatever i have done was for the people and for the country i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5569789 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5569790 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5569791 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5569792 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order
5569793 its a huge challenge and they cannot face it individually its very important for them to work together and i think they know that
5569794 america wants some immediate decisions on fighting terrorism and i dont think they will be able to concentrate on that
5569795 on the other hand are the people of this country the business community and there too i dont see any new initiatives
5569796 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5569797 whatever one might say it may be difficult for the politicians to give him the indemnity
5569798 there were certain elements who were politicking with the economy and terrorism
5569799 appear s to be successful in weeding out inappropriate candidates
5569800 when you send one message to twitter and we send it to 10 followers you are not charged 10 times because weve been footing the bill
5569801 we took a risk hoping to bring more nations onboard and more mobile operators round to our way of thinking but weve arrived at a point where the responsible thing to do is slow our costs and take a different approach
5569802 multiple assault type weapons were found various handguns altered firearms and unlawful possession firearms ammunition for those weapons homemade incendiary devices and military type incendiary devices
5569803 were finally able to get an apples to apples comparison
5569804 is to take those first time riders that are right now finding us and keep them riding we hope theyll see how much of a bargain it is to ride versus paying extra money at the pump and paying to park downtown
5569805 when i first started riding i had no problem finding a seat now i do you get used to seeing the same faces but a lot of them are different
5569806 i can walk to my stop its a combination of gas prices and the convenience i mean it feels like an even easier commute than it is
5569807 ive noticed that there seem to be more riders lately and my sister who rides in the mornings said shes really noticed it then
5569808 my husband and i share one vehicle and its so much easier to do it this way
5569809 the parking my gosh and the wear and tear on your car and the cost of gas nowadays taking the t may seem like a little bit of an inconvenience but its so much more cost effective
5569810 its still a good value as opposed to paying to park
5569811 i suppose increased ridership is good but we dont need really any more riders
5569812 i cant get a seat as it is by the time i get on it around 5 oclock its standing room only
5569813 p r o d u c t i o n s
5569814 youre just not going to go shopping when you got three kids with you
5569815 its really an event if we can capture some revenue off it terrific
5569816 it really is a true regional event that brings people downtown to celebrate the coming holidays
5569817 im pretty excited because of the opportunity to do stuff weve wanted to do for some time now that in and of itself is cool
5569818 theres a lot i can ask its not bringing him back to me
5569819 were hoping that this book will help them through some of the things they have to go through to get closure
5569820 its a traumatic event when someone gets injured and then they have to figure out how to get their questions answered
5569821 this sets up a whole program to make it easier for them to deal with all the things they have to deal with in the investigation
5569822 he died in 1956 and i was only born in 1950
5569823 more than a century of the top 1200 baby names in nsw
5569824 an error in judgment involving the approval of excessive transfer credits and excessive units for independent study in lieu of course work
5569825 we always take any issue regarding academic integrity very seriously
5569826 this is something where when we find out something like this we review it immediately
5569827 was brought to a faculty members attention earlier this year
5569828 im surprised because they are pretty meticulous about the rules and policies it would be useful to know exactly what happened
5569829 you cant help but make parallels between this and wvu
5569830 im very impressed by how they seem to be dealing with this nipping it in the bud
5569831 you dont treat someone who has been loyal to you given you this much of his life blood sweat and tears in such a publicly demeaning way
5569832 when somebody resigns you let them resign you dont do it in a public forum like this
5569833 this happened very quickly and i believe that the situation at wvu in which there was a diploma awarded outside the rules weighed heavily on the cmu administration
5569834 how are we supposed to get this thing out of here
5569835 i just want to get my hands on the controls
5569836 she wanted to see what all the fuss was about
5569837 the family and i believe another side of this story has to be told
5569838 at this point we are not saying he died of positional asphyxia or anything else because we dont have all the information
5569839 no evidence of internal injury to any vital organ that can explain the death
5569840 to indicate that there was no violence that night is inaccurate
5569841 ive been in practice 37 years and the only time i hear excited delirium used is when its in connection with a taser death
5569842 we are dismayed by the cavalier continuation of business as usual by the swissvale police
5569843 when police immobilize a person they must be held responsible for that persons safety too many innocent people like mr thomas have died
5569844 this is a big challenge for us a lot of people have tried and failed
5569845 i think the expectation in the community is that until we have the higher end destination retail there isnt any reason to shop downtown so we have to do it
5569846 saks fifth avenues departure would make the opportunity to attract similar retailers even less compelling
5569847 indeed one has to wonder whether the ubiquitous brands already in the golden triangle talbots ann taylor joseph a bank clothiers and bailey banks amp biddle would remain if the upscale anchor were to leave
5569848 if we can work to put something together with a property owner and a retailer and take it to them we think they would be receptive to that
5569849 cranes are dotting pittsburghs skyline downtown living is on the rise and in historic market square business is booming we must build upon this momentum working together to improve pittsburghs retail environment

5569852 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived
5569853 it also prevents students from thinking that the way something is now is the way its always been
5569854 the green bay packers almost always had the same quarterback
5569855 i mean for as long as i can remember brett favre was the man there
5569856 its almost crazy to think he could retire or be with another team
5569857 harry potter could be a classmate playing on their quidditch team
5569858 i wish it was sort of true being on quidditch with him would be kind of cool
5569859 we say join the club it makes us feel old too
5569860 the process of emptying out the kirkuk citadel was the climax of a forty year campaign known to iraqis as arabization beginning in 1963 and continuing up to the eve of the american invasion last year the baathist regime in baghdad deported tens of thousands of kurds some kurdish sources put the number at three hundred thousand from kirkuk and the surrounding region forced other ethnic minorities from their houses and imported similar numbers of arabs to kirkuk from the south
5569861 according to the 1957 census conducted before arabization began the city was forty per cent turkoman and thirty five per cent kurdish
5569862 writing of the ethnic composition of the city the ottoman encyclopedist shamsadin sami author of the qamus found that
5569863 by long standing tradition the kurds turkomans chaldeans and jews have had their own cemeteries the arabs being a minority buried their dead in the turkoman cemeteries however in 1991 saddam husseins government created special cemeteries for arab settlers and banned arab shiites from taking their dead back to najaf for burial in order to bolster the arab claim to the city the baathist regime subsequently began to rewrite kurdish tombstone inscriptions with arabic in order to retroactively alter the demography
5569864 esto es un juego muy peligroso y quiz los rusos quieren reconsiderarlo
5569865 no permitiremos que rusia dibuje una nueva l nea de separaci n en los estados que a n no est n integrados en la estructura transat ntica como georgia desconoce lo que los ministros de exteriores decidir n en la reuni n extraordinaria pero s adelant que hablar n
5569866 tenemos que rechazar los objetivos estrat gicos de rusia que estaban claramente encaminados a socavar la democracia de georgia a usar su capacidad militar para da ar y en algunos casos destruir las infraestructuras y a debilitar el estado georgiano
5569867 rusia no puede tener las dos cosas no puede actuar como lo hizo en la guerra fr a y esperar que se le trate como un socio responsable al mismo tiempo
5569868 es un estado que desafortunadamente usa el instrumento que siempre ha utilizado que es la fuerza militar
5569869 si rusia quiere hacer una elecci n estrat gica diferente eso es un mal comienzo

5569920 for one thing the kernel is quite complex and big and it inevitably simply takes time to learn all the rules not just for the code but for how the whole development environment works similarly for a new developer it will take time before people start recognizing the name and start trusting the developer to do the right things
5569921 we make it fairly easy for people to ease into kernel development
5569922 it seems to be working too we literally have thousands of people with patches attributed to them in each release
5569923 the worst thing anybody can do is to study the kernel alone and try to learn things in private and then however many months later present all the established kernel developers with a big patch that just comes out of the blue
5569924 it may not sound exciting but quite frankly i dont think anybody who starts out believing that they want to rewrite some big piece of the kernel should even bother reality isnt that simple
5569925 of course some people will be alienated and theres no doubt that the process could probably be improved
5569926 not a warm and fuzzy environment where people sing kumbaya around the fireplace
5569927 the kernel is about pretty harsh technical issues and mistakes are really frowned upon
5569928 in an os kernel there are simply more security and stability requirements and the bar is really higher in some respects that will inevitably also reflect in the response to patches
5569929 i think that one of the things weve been very good at is to scale up with a good network of maintainers so that most people involved actually dont work closely with more than a handful of people
5569930 normally the people you find at the core of open source projects are professional software engineers these guys know how to run software projects
5569931 they will observe the anniversary of the day she was born
5569932 we are concerned that if this issue is not urgently addressed it is only a matter of time before there is an avoidable death of a client in one of our communities due to delay in transfer to hospital
5569933 the government still does not understand the urgency of the issue
5569934 we now say how many more deaths will occur not when will the next death occur
5569935 and he brought a softness to it that i havent actually heard before he didnt really do too much with the arrangement but it was warm and tender and its hard to argue with that its a little tough to get
5569936 and his voice always surprises me for the first time i felt moved by drew tonight i felt like he and his guitar were weeping and performing on the 0 opinions for
5569937 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face
5569938 it is not rocket science here we could actually move aboriginal people across into these jobs
5569939 thirty years ago 20 years ago we were the fruit pickers we were the cotton chippers we did all this rural work we were the unskilled labourers in the rural industry
5569940 we created a false economy and then people got used to the idea of staying at home rather than actually going out and looking for work
5569941 in other words the requirements that we will put in place will ensure that if there is an australian or someone based in australia who is ready willing and able to work in the horticulture industry then theyll get the jobs first
5569942 were going to review that pilot program halfway through to see whether its a success to whether the requirements weve put in place are working effectively
5569943 and if it is successful to see whether it might be sensible to expand the capacity to other areas of australia or indeed to other countries in the pacific
5569944 yet for some inexplicable reason the labor party says the horticultural industry can have workers but the tourism industry cant
5569945 we need some clear and specific policy parameters before the opposition can determine whether or not we will support this
5569946 there are several industries we have looked at that are having labour shortage crisis issues and these are all industries that timor can gain skills from
5569947 what we have proposed is 300 employees and trainees in the first pilot year and we are also requesting 100 occupational trainees
5569948 timor would certainly benefit from the fact that we have such a large youth unemployed and unskilled so called bubble
5569949 these people guest workers certainly would assist in timors national and human security recovery and development
5569950 today the rights of the unborn children have been forsaken by the victorian government this is a very very sad event
5569951 i dont want women any more to feel that this is some kind of terrible shame

5569969 even against a tough comparison we expect hp to maintain double digit pc revenue growth on strength outside of the u s
5569970 if it does continue to strengthen you could see some of that be a headwind to top line growth
