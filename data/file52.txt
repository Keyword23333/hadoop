520000 il presidente non ha mai incontrato il signor valle n gli ha mai concesso unintervista
520001 its a contract for hosting pinoy fear factor well gusto ko yung show noong nabalitaan ko that abs cbn is doing pinoy fear factor i really asked for the project and i went through the auditions and i waited for the result nervously so gustong gusto ko talagang gawin yung show
520002 audition talaga may set up may hosting audition may challenges and my audution took about two hours im doing my spiel with this mountain roach and rodents sa katawan ko
520003 it was a very welcome news kasi akala ko talaga based on yung feeling ko noong nag audition ako feeling ko i didnt do so well so medyo na depress ako after the audition but when they actually told me that i got the job siyempre ang feeling ko naka tiyamba
520004 and it took a long time na makapagsara kami ni tita cory and naging tapat naman ako sa usapan na yon at si tita cory din ay naging tapat sa usapan
520005 ayun siya yung tumili for me siyempre after the initial excitement then she realized i will be gone for more than a month kasi sa south america yan e
520006 so when we realized na yun nga more than a month yun na realize namin na buti na lang nag quality time kami nang six months this year nakapag pondong quality time kaya we can spare i think 30 days apart
520007 i will be gone for more than a month kailangan kong mag ofw para kumita specifically for the concerns you mentioned dahil magiging tatay na ako
520008 we our doing our own version of the endemol show and we are going to shoot it in south america
520009 contestants will come to terms with their greatest fears and outdo themselves in a foreign land far from home and face their new environment
520010 noong pinag aralan namin they suggested why not do it either in south africa or argentina so it was just a matter of where it would be more practical for us to do it since we wanted to do it this year the consensus was to shoot it all cost considered in argentina
520011 yung series ng philippines will be the 31st series that will be shot in argentina so kabisadong kabisado na nila the props and the stunts are there the stunts supervisor all the experts handang handa na sila sa argentina so its more practical for us talaga na dalhin doon
520012 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
520013 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
520014 all i can say is they called us this afternoon for the first time regarding this issue about sonia pitts termination status

520018 ive been getting asked a lot what they sound like had to think about it for a second way more of a band vibe than most of my solo record leaning toward the possibility of pulling something off live in the future
520019 as we become hard to describe id imagine it would be like locking
520020 kamu anak bodoh yang tidak akan menjadi apa apa kelak
520021 kalau ingat masa lalu ketika merilis album pertama miris hati saya melihat ulasan media yang sebagian besar bernada negatif
520022 saat masuk ke dunia film saya sudah siap siap mendapat kritikan tajam
520023 selama 20 tahun karir saya dalam bidang manajemen kita bisa mengajarkan skill pada orang lain tapi tidak passion
520024 orang yang sukses tidak menyesali masa lalu tidak melihat hambatan sebagai akhir atau kritik negatif sebagai vonis
520025 its hard to beat a person who never give up
520026 he wants the best and he wants to relate to us that there are some things that hes not going to bend on
520027 there are definitely some rules that hes just not going to let people slide on because the integrity of the game is bigger than each person that plays the game and you have to maintain that
520028 there are no guarantees in life perhaps no one should put herself in a
520029 theyre young players but i dont treat them like young guys
520030 i treat them like veteran guys and theyve responded well its good to get the pads on the last few days and find out what were really about because we look ok in shorts but whether or not we look good in pads remains to be seen
520031 this is my first opportunity in three and a half years where i actually have a chance to be on the field in games but being on the practice squad ive had the chance to play against some real good dbs so its all about getting acclimated to what youre doing
520032 we have t j and chad getting double teamed and you put another guy down the middle of the field thats going to relieve some of the pressure there
520033 i wouldnt describe it as a pep talk i would describe it as a discussion about their responsibility as nfl players what we expect of them as players some of the key issues were facing as a league and they asked a lot of questions very intelligent questions
520034 it is complex because you want to look at each case individually and this is one of the questions they asked but you also want to be consistent you have to look at other incidents but we really focus on repeat behavior when you have repeat behavior and circumstances around it the player has to be accountable for that and responsible for that if he is on the edge of things he has to be responsible for his behavior its a reality that comes with being an nfl player and being involved in the nfl and what are fans expect
520035 you heard that it has to be collectively bargained so its not an issue we would be clearly addressing whether we have an agreement or not we have an issue here and something is wrong with the system flawed with the system and we have to address it i think its better for the players the teams and most important for the fans i think its a disservice when players arent in camp
520036 i think every player has a different opinion but they recognize that the system is flawed and their interest is theyd like to see if money is saved by not paying rookies that it go to other players i understand that thats something were open to discussing my issue is its clearly having economic issues and it affects all of the players in a negative fashion it has some non football issues veteran leadership suffers when rookies are paid more than veterans they are uncomfortable asserting the leadership they should in the locker room
520037 as of yesterday friday aug 1 any players that are suspended there is a financial consequence to that team when a player is suspended so a team has a financial consequence and they are working hard to avoid those issues they are providing the resources and the counseling and the other service hopefully allow them to make better decisions but at some point in time if you have a suspension theres a financial consequence to that team
520038 right now as you know we work on a 20 game season four preseason and 16 regular season i think ive been quite clear publicly and with our membership that i think the quality of the preseason is not up to nfl standards and that we should address that so were actively evaluating and considering whether we should modify that ratio and make it 17 and 3 as one example where theres an additional regular season rather than the preseason game we swap it out with the same number of games i think its a better reflection on the quality of our game
520039 i think were going to continue to follow success so far the regular season games have been a tremendous success i think were limited in the number of games we can put overseas on a regular season basis because were taking those away from fans here in the united states and were sensitive to that thats also maybe part of the attractiveness of converting one of the preseason games into a regular season game that could allow you to take maybe additional games overseas where we are getting a tremendous reaction and its a way to grow the game we think that is intelligent for the players and the nfl
520040 well dhani jones had had a whole page of notes of questions but they were very intelligent questions we talked about the safety of the game we talked about really not much about the labor agreement other than the fact there are issues we need to address we talked about other issues that we probably dont have an opportunity to discuss enough they were very forthcoming they had good questions and they had good comments to me i learned a lot

520048 maintenance of a general high level of business in the united states during december was reviewed today by robert p lamont secretary of commerce as an indication that american industry had reached a point where a break in new york stock prices does not necessarily mean a national depression

520064 mijn overwinning in 2004 streelt mijn ego totaal niet ik erken wel dat ik dankzij de quiz bekend ben geworden bij het grote publiek ook heeft het mij professioneel geen windeieren heeft gelegd
520065 humor is slechts n van de vele zaken waarmee ik bezig ben eigenlijk heb ik geen beroep ik schrijf boeken en columns al 17 jaar lang werk ik voor de radio en ik krijg regelmatig televisieopdrachten in het verleden was ik bedrijfsleider met een team van 7 mensen onder mij heel afwisselend werk dus voor mij persoonlijk staat 2007 in het teken staat van theater met maar liefst 165 voorstellingen tot nu toe mijn onemanshow wereldberoemd in vlaanderen die in januari dit jaar in premi re is gegaan neemt hiervan 100 voorstellingen voor zijn rekening dat ik de slimste mens ter wereld won heeft mij professioneel zeker geen windeieren gelegd dankzij deze quiz raakte ik meer bekend bij het grote publiek wat voor mij zeker een professionele versnelling met zich meebracht waar je normaal gezien 5 jaar voor nodig voor hebt is dankzij mijn deelname gereduceerd tot 2 jaar al moet je wel oppassen met deze redenering het gaat pas op als je er klaar voor bent en genoeg ervaring hebt als je op zon moment niet kan fietsen val je onherroepelijk op de grond ik ben al heel mijn leven met comedy bezig als veertienjarige trotseerde ik voor de eerste keer het podium een decennium geleden stond ik samen met o a peter perceval en nigel williams aan de wieg van the comedy circus dit was het allereerste standupcomedy collectief in vlaanderen die ervaring kon ik verzilveren toen ik meer bekend raakte bij het grote publiek dankzij de slimste mens ter wereld
520066 humor is voor mij zoiets als ademen drinken eten en seks
520067 humor kent strikt genomen geen grenzen elk onderwerp kan en mag gebruikt worden je houdt natuurlijk wel rekening met de doelgroep van de avond een voorstelling in een jeugdhuis of caf verloopt anders dan een voorstelling in een cultureel centrum ik hou mij steeds aan de grote lijnen van de voorstelling maar ik probeer toch een verschil te maken in themakeuze of in humoraanpak ook is er nog steeds een groot verschil tussen het vlaamse platteland en de stad je merkt dat sommige themas zoals bijvoorbeeld zedendelicten binnen de kerk zich nog steeds in een grotere taboesfeer bevinden op het platteland dan in de stad al is mijn humor zeker nooit choquerend bedoeld in mijn boek en in de theaterversie van wereldberoemd in vlaanderen steek ik de draak met bepaalde bvs ik ben op de hoogte van gevoelige priv informatie van verschillende bekende vlamingen toch baseer ik mij vooral op wat reeds in de media over hen is verschenen dus persoonlijk zie ik geen problemen bij het verschijnen van het boek heb ik openlijk kritiek gekregen van ontevreden bvs ik weet dat ik persona non grata ben geworden voor verschillende mensen maar toch raakt deze kritiek mij niet echt ik heb recht op een vrije meningsuiting een recht dat iedereen heeft en ook mag uitoefenen voor mij primeert de boodschap die ik wel vertellen dit blijft het centrale uitgangspunt ik beschouw mij niet als een reisleider die enkel de moppen vertelt die de mensen graag willen horen mijn gouden regel is dat ik de grenzen van de humor aftast totdat ik de communicatie met mijn publiek verlies dan stop ik want het is natuurlijk niet de bedoeling dat ik mijn publiek afstoot
520068 humor kent een constante evolutie het is een weerspiegeling van wat er leeft in de maatschappij op een bepaald tijdsmoment tot de jaren 70 had je bijvoorbeeld de schoonmoedermoppen vele mensen trokken in bij de schoonouders dit omwille van financi le redenen door de gestegen welvaart in vlaanderen is dit fenomeen stilaan uitgestorven de schoonmoedermoppen die toen heel herkenbaar waren zijn nu helemaal pass zo ook met humor over gendarmen tot voor enkele jaren nog voor de politiehervorming was de rijkswacht een onderdeel van het leger klantvriendelijkheid was toen een woord dat niet in hun woordenboek voorkwam zo zie je de maatschappij evolueert heel snel en de humor dus ook taboes worden doorbroken en vele zaken worden bespreekbaar toch mag je dit alles niet als een rechtlijnige evolutie bekijken ook het omgekeerde is mogelijk kijk maar naar humor rond de islam wat je er twintig jaar gelden over kon vertellen is nu niet meer mogelijk er zijn andere extreme voorbeelden uit de geschiedenis die een omgekeerde evolutie aantonen het duitsland van de jaren 20 kende een ongelofelijke bloei van creatief satirisch cabaret kurt tucholski is een heel bekende naam uit die periode schrijver en dichter van zeer satirische en politiek getinte werken nvdr vanaf 33 toen de nazis aan de macht kwamen werd de klok op artistiek gebied teruggedraaid er was toen geen plaats meer voor dit type cabaret het lijkt misschien een extreem voorbeeld maar volgens mij kan dit nog altijd en overal gebeuren zo is de maatschappij en de humor in de verenigde staten nu veel conservatiever geworden dan in de jaren 70 indien ik persoonlijk zou geconfronteerd worden met zon omgeerde tendens vrees ik dat ik het als comedian voor bekeken hou dat geldt volgens mij voor elke artiest eens je hebt kunnen proeven van een artistieke vrijheid is er geen weg meer terug
520069 humor is een deel van mijn leven en dat zal altijd zo blijven ik zal nooit met pensioen gaan om dan eindelijk leuke zaken te kunnen doen simpelweg omdat ik mij nu goed voel bij al de zaken die ik doe dus op mijn 65 ste liefst geen partijtje golf om daarna met de vrouw te gaan lunchen daar pas ik voor de voorbije 17 jaar heb ik professioneel een grote afwisseling gekend ik erken dat ik als zelfstandige geen financi le zekerheid heb mijn gezin waaronder mijn vrouw en twee kinderen is afhankelijk van mijn inkomen toch lig ik daar niet echt wakker van ik heb namelijk nooit iets anders gekend dan het statuut van zelfstandige de mogelijkheid bestaat dat ik over vier jaar geen voldoening meer heb als professionele comedian als dat zou gebeuren vind ik wel iets anders waar ik mij wel bij goed voel wie weet ga ik in de politiek of begin ik dichtbundels te schrijven op de oevers van de maas niemand weet wat de toekomst in petto heeft

520078 i am in the process of doing an essay on reparations for slavery and it saddens me to read about how caucasians are blowing off the fact that their large corporations of today got their start from the back breaking labor and the sale of slaves
520079 i am amazed at how certain people blow slavery off as if it was some small skirmish that barely made it into the history books
520080 yes there is limited information in our schools history books about slavery but our children learn very quickly the differences and barriers that keep them slave like
520081 there are always going to be people who hate us just because of the color of our skin and those that still look at us as animals illiterate heathens and whatever else is beneath them
520082 since the 1800s the white race has had the opportunity to build and prosper and pass that prosperity down thru their generations so that they will leave a legacy behind
520083 the african american legacy was to be owned and treated worse than animals and thought to be ignorant how do we get past all that

520143 the roundtable conference would not be affected even if we decide not to quit the government
520144 we also concluded that a roundtable conference organized by the maoists while they are in government cant yield any political outlet
520145 there is no basis for the doj argument that close presidential advisers are absolutely immune from compelled congressional testimony
520146 the prime minister told the maoist leadership that this is not the time to quit the government
520147 the prime minister also said that the eight party unity must be further strengthened
520148 we all four maoist ministers in the government have issued an ultimatum to the prime minister to draw serious attention of the government to our issues related to 22 point demands
520149 we told him that if these issues do not become the agenda in the cabinet than we wont have any other choice than to quit the government

520158 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
520159 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
520160 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
520161 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
520162 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
520163 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
520164 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
520165 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
520166 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
520167 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
520168 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
520169 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
520170 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

520197 is just another temporary bear market rally that will fizzle away once the onslaught of bad financial and macro news builds up again
520198 since residential investment is only 5 percent of even a worsening housing market recession cannot by itself trigger an economy wide recession
520199 rather since private consumption is over 70 percent of aggregate demand a sharp and persistent slowdown in consumption growth below 1 percent or even negative is necessary to trigger a full blown recession

520201 the evidence is consistent with the idea that at least initially more robust enforcement caused the number of illegal immigrants to decline significantly
520202 some people seem to think illegals are so permanently anchored in the united states that there is no possibility of them leaving this suggests theyre not correct some significant share might respond to changing incentives and leave
520203 im a poor loser my supporters are racists and i have no ethical standards thats why i should be the democratic nominee
520204 who has shoved this obama down the throats of the ameerican republic
520205 while the facts are rarely a good defense against fools led by a scoundrel all that can be done is lay out the truth in public for all to see
520206 nobody has ever won u s president that wanted to lose a war
520207 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
520208 there is no pride to be had in such efforts
520209 you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
520210 whenever these preconditions are met then the supposition is true no matter what other findings occur
520211 obviously that rule finding is alloted enough points to tip the scales in support of the supposition
520212 a male usually wearing a red shirt and waving a pistol is a robber call the police
520213 a full house is the distillation of a hand into three a s and two b s
520214 all i wanted him to do is just add this one rule set to the system and he goes off and rewrites the entire system to do it
520215 oh youve already computed a 3 1 to be 13 so you dont need to recompute that entire branch any more
520216 well sometimes the simplest proof can elude me for days and sometimes something that appears much more difficult comes in a flash
520217 now can you do that while you slowly rotate around the bed
520218 i dont know whats going to happen with this thing i really dont
520219 is to make sure theres a marketplace on the web for these people to make money not to build farm teams for another medium
520220 its like we are in california 100 years ago with a movie camera and a tent setting up on the side of a river
520221 its the kind of shoot where you need a permit
520222 one of the great selling points of working for next to nothing is that you can really have an opportunity to bring your vision to the screen without any interference
520223 you are all able to go to the limit to be more extreme in anything you can do than in television or film what i am really interested in is new media whats fun for me is to create stories and do things that have never been done before
520224 if i have the value already computed if the list length is equal to or greater than the requested index then return just that value otherwise ive got nothing so you need to compute that value
520225 keep filter all the numbers from 1 to x that divide x with no rem ainder
520226 find the first triangular number with more than 500 factors
520227 a list is different if there is only one number
520228 a list is different if one of the numbers is different than every other number in the list and if this is true for all the numbers in the list
520229 split a list into one element and rest in all possible ways

520231 if you havent killed anything in this game its a sign youre doing something
520232 weve got kids who are in pretty good shape and were a pretty strong football team well have to push them a little harder as we go but our coaches have done a really nice job of working the mental part of the game and i think our kids are probably a little bit further along scheme wise than we have been in the past
520233 we would have worked on special teams yesterday but we just had so much installation to do offensively and defensively
520234 this is really early for us typically we dont jump into special teams for a while i like what we did today it looks like we found a couple of guys who can snap the football
520235 i dont think were going to have any issues i thought two or three of the kids did a real nice job today being back with us is nice because he was our backup last year he had a little more pop than the other guys i thought lee malchow had a couple of good snaps as well well be fine
520236 weve been in the position before where weve come into august without a very good feel about our starters were in a pretty good situation now where were trying to develop our depth our starting tight ends need to prove themselves is going to play a lot he played a little bit last year behind john tereshinski and zac selmon hes a guy who needs to step up and have a good year chip brinkman and d j boldin have kind of been in the shadows and now they have to step up and play well we have some good young receivers we feel good about them but you like to see your older guys who are in their last year of football step up and make something happen is a guy whos going to be a senior for us thats playing out there on the corner it would be great to see kerry have a good august and feel like we can throw him out on the corner because hes one of the faster guys on our team weve got pretty good depth at the linebacker position up front were in pretty good shape well find three tackles and three ends that will play our goal is rather than find one or two people that have to step up its finding a group that can challenge that first unit to play the backup positions alex frye is one of those guys that has freaky good ability not good ability but freaky good ability he has great foot speed he made the great play against maryland last year where he ran the guy down his problem is that hes still a young guy hes hot and cold he goes to sleep sometimes effort wise if we can just get alex to the point where we get some consistency out of him hes going to play a lot of football hes a guy who can really help out chip vaughn and k p at safety if we can just get him to be a consistent guy hes a really bright guy and has no problem with our defense making checks and all those things we just need him to get out and grind a little bit because hes a really good player one of my coaches used to say some guys are artists not painters we need alex to be a little more of a worker
520237 it gives us a lot of hell do that every throw the thing that riley did last year when we went to bc he put a little too much pressure on himself to beat matt ryan he wanted to match up with matt he was as nervous as ive ever seen him ive never seen him be that nervous before he made a couple of poor red zone decisions i thought from halfway through the season on maryland he did some great things then he really settled down the rest of the season you have a very comfortable guy in riley youve got a guy who realizes he doesnt have to be a rock star he doesnt have to be the guy he just has to be a guy who doesnt get us beat certainly leading the nation in completion percentage was good but i wouldnt want his goals to be set on being better than last year id like for his goals to be set on winning more games than last year
520238 probably not much at all youve got to remember that jeff was an old offensive line coach and it took him a few years to not coach the quarterbacks the way he used to coach the tackles and tight ends i thought he was going to get them over on the sleds and start driving 200 pound dummies and all that kind of stuff but new quarterback coach tommy elrod played quarterback here played for a great coach in so he has great expertise in having been coached by somebody who is considered a great quarterback coach in the nfl tommys got a great background and tommy recruited riley so they have a great relationship i would say we wont skip a beat there
520239 that it was a basketball school that was during the chris paul era when i was recruited wake forest had a pretty good basketball team we were number one in the nation my freshman year i think the feeling was that i was going to a basketball school and they didnt care about football
520240 definitely coming out here on saturdays and seeing the fan support is incredible in the spring game my freshman year you would just see the parents of each of the players this year we had fans locals parents and friends of parents wanting to know about wake forest football it has definitely changed
520241 no im just focused on baylor right now and trying to think about the baylor bears
520242 were approaching it the same way were trying to come out every day and try to get better were going to play hard every snap were going to try to be mentally perfect and hopefully the scoreboard will take care of itself
520243 the deacon tower is different the passion of the game has spread to the entire team everybody loves to come out in the heat and go after it weve won close games and lost some close games the program is building and its proven with deacon tower
520244 weve proven that all these universities play football also recruiting is getting better for everyone high school football in the state of north carolina is getting better north carolina duke nc state and wake are all getting really good players weve all proven that at any given moment any of us could win the conference or lose the conference as long as were playing good we can get better and we prove that by showing that football is important by building bigger stadiums and putting buildings like deacon tower up
520245 we put too much pressure on ourselves all we kept thinking was we have to be some spectacular team who goes out and dominates everybody we play and prove that we can play we kind of got out of our rhythm and what we like to do as a team and managing the game and taking what the defense gives us just playing the field position game we started to get back into that we started to get back into our rhythm and feel comfortable and then we started to win a lot of games
520246 after the first two or three games we all realized what we were doing
520247 starting out last season with bc was tough i think its going to help not having a division game to start off with but our first division game is at florida state and shortly after that is clemson even though its not right off the bat were still starting off with two of our biggest division games in the first four weeks of the season
520248 to be honest i didnt know we were in the coaches poll until somebody asked me that in an interview before practice on friday there wasnt much talk about it it feels really good to be ranked but we won the acc championship in 2006 and we were ranked last that kind of shows you how much the preseason polls mean and how much the people know about predicting the season were not really focusing on that were just focusing on baylor i feel like the first couple of games are going to really determine how well play as a team were 100 percent focused on baylor right now and not looking ahead
520249 its good to be in the top 25 but we want to finish a lot higher than that i think if we stay healthy and we do what the coaches ask and we stay with our game plan we have the chance to finish a lot higher than that
520250 i miss him he was an awesome coach were also real good friends we talked a lot and we still do ive probably talked to him five or six times this summer we just call each other to shoot the breeze or talk about football or about golf hes really enjoying it up there right now i think the relationship between me and our other quarterbacks and coach tom elrod is great its fortunate for us that four quarterbacks in the room were recruited by coach elrod so we have that relationship and not just a football relationship which is a big part to having chemistry in the quarterbacks room elrod is a little more laid back but he still gets after it weve only had one day of practice and he even got heated on that first day we know hes not going to sit back and let us do whatever we want it helps me and it helps brett hodges not being as tight and kind of insecure when youre out there on the field knowing that if you screw up youre going to get chewed out there are some differences and some similarities that i like and dislike
520251 i did a lot of training back at home just throwing and working out i worked on a lot of shoulder strength doing a lot of exercises for that trying to get a little more zip on the ball now that ive been up here ive been trying to put on a little bit of weight ive been able to gain about seven or eight pounds which has been good i feel good and i feel like i accomplished what i wanted to now we just have to get the offense on the same page and get rolling
520252 im not really nervous about our offensive line everyone keeps saying that theyre new but i think all five of them have started a game or two that part doesnt make me nervous because i know those guys are going to get it done up front theyve been working their tails off this summer its going to be tough because were not going to have as much depth thats the biggest thing and a question mark for our team right now but our offensive lineman have been getting in such good shape that they wont have to rotate every two or three series if we can stay healthy we wont have any problems with our offensive line
520253 had we had a little better feel or a little better read on that at every step of the way i would have said hello to him walking down the hall
520254 its a different world for him and i think it should be
520255 and i think that were going to be a benefactor of that
520256 i feel like im the same as ive always been
520257 try to throw the ball to the guy whos open that usually helps
520258 obviously his lifes changed 100 percent but hes the same guy a little bit more guarded maybe but for the most part hes the same guy
520259 at that point in time it was a situation where i felt like i had to have his back
520260 he had been tearing us up since weve been here
520261 i dont think anybody would have thats why its been such a phenomenon
520262 theres no question that having a competitive quarterback does inspire you if youre in my shoes and youre trying to make those decisions
520263 the closer you feel like youre getting then the more youre motivated to go ahead and extend
520264 there is always a little nostalgia in some ways about the process and what it took to get where you are its funny you still have a long way to go
520265 im trying to play im trying to get on the field and get better the exciting thing really about the game is just improvement
520266 theyre a little better than i am theres good reason for that
520267 aix assenyalat pel president ch vez i que s un plantejament hist ric del partit comunista des de 1931

520285 concord has come a long way since its launch 10 years ago
520286 we have successfully provided an accessible and affordable option for legal education we have more than 800 graduates across the country who are making their mark on the legal community and in their work places and we are partnering with traditional law schools to provide an online platform to deliver legal education we expect that over the next 10 years concord will continue to redefine legal education in the u s and beyond
520287 the mission of concord law school has been to expand access to a high quality legal education for students who cannot participate in traditional programs
520288 in todays competitive knowledge based global economy it is important that we find ways to meet the needs of adult learners who want to increase their skills and grow professionally
520289 long has our nation the united states of america kept the forces of chaos at bay
520290 by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe
520291 we sleep soundly in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence upon those who would do us harm
520292 kitwiti four year old male a vender from oshn gave kitwiti to a cousin at the ministry of agriculture who then brought kitwiti to the sanctuary he had been mutlilated and was missing some teeth and fingers he was also shy but quickly gained confidence thanks to the nurturing of a surrogate mother kitwiti now welcomes all visitors to the sanctuary
520293 think for a moment and tell me how you would explain the contradiction between man the engineer and the stupidity of his systems of beliefs or the stupidity of his contradictory behavior sorcerers believe that the predators have given us our systems of beliefs our ideas of good and evil our social mores they are the ones who set up our hopes and expectations and dreams of success and failure they have given us covetousness greed and cowardice it is the predators who make us complacent routinary and egomaniacal
520294 do they whisper all that in our ears while we sleep
520295 they are infinitely more efficient and organized than that in order to keep us obedient and meek and weak the predators engaged themselves in a stupendous maneuver stupendous of course from the point of view of a fighting strategist a horrendous maneuver from the point of view of those who suffer it they gave us their mind do you hear me the predators give us their mind which becomes our mind the predators mind is baroque contradictory morose filled with fear of being discovered any minute now
520296 artists tell lies to reveal truth and sometimes make money politicians or most
520297 the issue of sex in space is a serious one
520298 the experiments carried out so far relate to missions planned for married couples on the future international space station the successor to mir scientists need to know how far sexual relations are possible without gravity

520325 we sleep soundly in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence upon those who would do us harm
520326 welcome to com 11 then to increase the retardedness state the obvious
520327 diz j00 firz post 1 which is so pathetically obvious that
520328 the phenomenon of a popular website linking to a smaller site causing the smaller site to slow down or even temporarily close due to the increased traffic
520329 the roman catholic church has vowed to fight the devil head on by training hundreds of priests as exorcists
520330 too many bishops are not taking this seriously and are not delegating their priests in the fight against the devil you have to hunt high and low for a proper trained exorcist
520331 fr amorth added that pope benedict xvi wanted to reinstate use of the prayer said to st michael the archangel believed to be the prime protector against evil
520332 the prayer is useful not only for priests but for lay people for example if a lay person knows someone who is possessed and there is no exorcist available they can intervene by saying this prayer commanding the demon to leave that person
520333 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over
520334 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over sign in before you can post messages
520335 conditions will take away with one hand what has been given with the other
520336 would literally take away with one hand what has been given with the other
520337 the nsg guidelines apply to non nuclear weapons states nnws so our preference is for the nsg to simply say that these guidelines do not apply to india if they are unwilling to say that at a minimum the requirement of full scope safeguards and other prescriptive elements in the guidelines that are intended for nnws must be waived for india
520338 if you read the nsg guidelines as a whole right at the top it says these prescriptions are for non nuclear weapon states there is an enunciation of the requirement that countries must accept full scope safeguards there is language about what happens if one of these states tests there is restrictive language on enrichment and reprocessing enr equipment and so on
520339 of course we are very clear that there cannot be any linkage with nuclear tests
520340 but just as in the 123 agreement with the u s there cannot be any explicit linkage to nuclear testing as a condition in the nsg
520341 i am not interested in labels like the npt definition of a nuclear weapon state because we are what we are
520342 but certainly we dont want the other label to be attached to us either
520343 are any of these elements present in those agreements so our view is that all these things in the nsg are extraneous tomorrow if the political situation changes all these things can create difficulties
520344 we cannot afford to lose the battle against the ideologies of hatred fanaticism and against all those who seek to destroy our social fabric
520345 we have only to see the rapid integration within association of south east asian nations asean and its emergence as an important bloc in asia to understand the opportunities that beckon
520346 terrorists and extremists know no borders the recent attack on the indian embassy in kabul and the serial blasts in bangalore and ahmedabad are gruesome reminders of the barbarity that still finds a place here in south asia we must act jointly and with determination to fight this scourge we must defend the values of pluralism peaceful coexistence and the rule of law
520347 these terrorist attacks are a rapidly growing threat not just to afghanistan or india but for the entire saarc region
520348 no amount of outrage and condemnation can suffice to express the anger and frustration we all feel when faced with such mindless brutality and violence in pakistan terrorism and its sanctuaries are gaining a deeper grip as demonstrated by the tragic assassination of benazir bhutto
520349 the deadly fangs of terrorism are spreading across the region they threaten to disrupt peace and stability we must combat this menace of terrorism across the broadest possible spectrum
520350 terrorism has perpetrated brutal attacks in every part of the world we condemn the heinous terrorist attacks in afghanistan india and pakistan in recent times which caused unnecessary loss of valuable lives and property
520351 unequivocally condemned these senseless and reprehensible acts of violence regardless of how sublime noble and even desperate a cause may be

520380 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried

520390 to qualify for a tick simply by changing the serving size recommendation i think is just not consistent with the principle of the tick i mean you could in an extreme situation say ill have half a piece of this chocolate bar instead of a whole chocolate bar and it meets the tick the pick the tick programme is trying to get manufacturers to reformulate and produce foods that have less salt and less energy and less saturated fat and thats good but in this food product it just doesnt exist
520391 there clearly is a downside when its consumed in too large an amount but its the real world and i think its better that we make the recommendation in a positive way and educate people about the benefits of this product with trim milk as a healthy milk drink
520392 were trying to be responsible in terms of the whole obesity environment

520439 across the casentino there runs a stream called archiano born in the apennines above the hermitage there at the place where that streams name is lost i came my throat was pierced fleeing on foot and bloodying the plain and there it was that i lost sight and speech and there as i had finished uttering the name of mary i fell and there my flesh alone remained you are aware how in the air moist vapor will gather and again revert to rain as soon as it has climbed where cold enfolds his evil will which only seeks out evil conjoined with intellect and with the power his nature grants he stirred up wind and vapor and then when day was done he filled the valley from pratomagno far as the great ridge with mist the sky above was saturated the dense air was converted into water rain fell and then the gullies had to carry whatever water earth could not receive and when that rain was gathered into torrents it rushed so swiftly toward the royal river that nothing could contain its turbulence the angry archiano at its mouth had found my frozen body and it thrust it in the arno and set loose the cross that on my chest my arms in pain had formed it rolled me on the banks and river bed then covered girded me with its debris

520600 of course we need freedom for families to make their choice among hospitals and home birth options for a case for home birth and against the establishment that embraces a program of processing women in labor as fast as it can through the systematic reliance on the pitocin epidural cesarean process see the great documentary the business of being born
520601 the artificial process of bringing on contractions then giving pain relief then bringing on more contractions then resorting to cesareans when things dont go as smoothly and quickly as desired reminds me of the spiral of interventionism mises described

520609 cashing out a structured settlement eliminates the tax free guaranteed payment stream that you and your family may receive on a monthly annual or semi annual basis
520610 with the diminishing state of the stock market and the collapsing housing market it would be a wise investment to keep the guaranteed payment stream of intact experts predict that the housing market will continue to spiral out of control for the next few years creating an investment portfolio from the sale of a structured settlement could create disaster for you and your family

520643 ap is the major news source for the thousands of news outlets around the country america who cannot afford to have their own foreign correspondents when ap chooses not to cover something its omission is felt throughout the nation when national news networks and others leave out the same facts the cover up is almost total
520644 for example a few months ago in a typical ap story on this power struggle
520645 such omissions by ap and large swaths of the american media leave americans seriously disadvantaged in deciphering what is going on in russia and its profound significance for the world
520646 you would think it would be hot news when wanted men being hunted by european police suddenly pop up in the us particularly on capitol hill and at events attended by the us president yet there was not a single ap story in the us on any of this not a single national network television or radio news program even mentioned these facts in fact google and lexisnexis searches four days after these events took place turned up only three newspaper articles on them anywhere in the entire country
520647 prosecutors in russia have been searching the world for a pair of oil tycoons who got on president vladimir putins bad side
520648 in russia the oligarchs are deeply loathed considered villains who worked to bleed the country dry during their reign many russian citizens saw their life savings disappear overnight
520649 for years the neocons push for war against iraq was largely uncovered by the us media for even longer the neocons close connections to israel have gone largely unmentioned in mainstream american news reports as a result very few americans know to what degree many of those responsible for the tragic us invasion and occupation of iraq have been motivated by israeli concerns the omission in coverage of iraq has been profoundly disastrous both for the middle east and for americans in fact it is quite likely that only history will show the true extent of this disaster it is deeply troubling to see the same kind of omission occurring on russia
520650 a world in which human life doesnt have the same value as it does in the west
520651 morriss blunt soul bearing has lifted the last barrier of propriety to the open expression of raw arab hatred one longs for some gigantic outcry of opposition or disgust over this confession of deep bigotry but there has been none except for a few letters to the editor of haaretz from american jews the interview has aroused little attention in the jewish american community no denunciation no shock little or no discussion on any but the most progressive jewish e mail lists you have to assume that however awkward morriss blunt language may be he is speaking for a large segment of american jews who say they oppose the occupation say they hate sharon say they hate israels oppression of the palestinians but who do nothing about any of these things and who in the end would not grieve either for the palestinians or for the jewish soul if israel wiped the palestinians off the map
520652 when israel faced defeat before the united armies of egypt and syria sec of state henry kissinger ordered america armaments flown into the israel occupied sinai peninsula giving israel a pivotal advantage against her arab foes the ensuing arab outrage produced the great oil embargo of 1973 sending the u s into a debilitating recession for the better part of a decade

520662 en dat zette me aan het denken over deze commercial
520663 both players showed good movement and so did gerrard the three were key to keeping possession
520664 dirk kuyt and yossi benayoun were coming inside so i felt we had five offensive players very clever and with quality so we were a threat all the time
520665 keane is very clever and he worked hard hopefully we will see a lot of good movement and also goals from him
520666 the first half was okay but in the second half they needed to go forward in front of their supporters we had more space and we scored the second goal on the counter attack
520667 in the second half with the game more open it was easier for us to keep the high tempo
520668 well i take whatever i want and baby i want you
520669 theyre good players and liverpool can really benefit from that the partnership between keane and torres could mean a change of emphasis in the way liverpool play compared to the past couple of seasons
520670 i think theyll give them the opportunity to challenge for the title and take them on from just achieving a top four finish torres and keane could give them that edge
520671 we have to get up and playing theres no running away from that and we must do it very quickly
520672 we didnt take a lot from the game apart from that we were well beaten
520673 i dont think the morale aspect has got anything to do with it i dont think morale will be a problem
520674 the problem is getting back to a level of play that will allow us to compete in a better manner

520682 i pushed too hard on my first flyer and ended up understeering off at the sweeper
520683 i has two offs in that session which is pretty rare for me and i only managed one flying lap
520684 i got past a few at the start and just kept at it through the whole race
520685 we struggled as a team today grant johnson was slower than normal as well
520686 the boys will work on the set up tonight and hopefully improve it as i have to start from grid 4 tomorrow
520687 starting up the front should help me to pick up a bit of time as well because there is added pressure and a few faster guys that i can learn a lot off
520688 if we can get a top result in race 2 it will set me up for a strong finish in race 3 and the round
520689 to be honest with you we didnt qualify too badly we probably had the car to be in fourth but didnt maximise it in the third leg
520690 we have to find a bit of pace tonight and hopefully we can stay out of trouble tomorrow and also hopefully the guys will tame themselves down a little bit
520691 we were a little bit disappointed in qualifying we had a reasonable paced car there but we needed to squeeze a bit more out of it we only needed a tenth of a second and we would have been up there
520692 in the race we made a good start and got up to tenth position after we came in for tyres triple eight were out in front of us and we lost a bit of time trying to manoeuvre around them it also cost us towards the end with the car not looking after its tyres as well as it should have
520693 after a couple of practice sessions we put in a good effort in qualifying and scored pole so it is a good start to the weekend
520694 hopefully we can get out in front and stay out of trouble and consolidate a large points haul
520695 the first five laps were real slippery and it took a while for the car to come on
520696 i didnt expect to qualify so high as i didnt feel like i got a fast lap in and it is hard to when someone runs off and drag a lot of dirt back onto the circuit
520697 we came here for a test day a few weeks ago in the wet so we were hoping for a wet session but unfortunately it didnt rain
520698 the car feels fantastic though and we are pretty happy with the result in our first real drive in the dry and it puts us in a good position to score some solid points
520699 the car took a while to come on song as i scored my fastest lap on my final lap
520700 the car is pretty twitchy but we should be able to fix that by race 1 and that should allow us to stick with the front bunch

520739 i dont think the sport of baseball can mandate cultural behavior but i think baseball does a wonderful job of setting a good example by and large day in and day out
520740 i think its important to be very punitive in terms of disciplinary measures if anything happens that takes away from that aspect of minor league baseball

520786 those who aspire to less accomplish less there can be no doubt it is better i think to grab at the stars than to sit flustered because you know you cannot reach them at least he who reaches will get a good stretch a good view and perhaps even a low hanging apple for his effort

520788 already have the proper agricultural infrastructure such as irrigation for agriculture we want to give them a start we want young people to look at what we have and focus their minds on how we can make that better
520789 its a shame i didnt manage to get the best out of the car in q3 mainly because of traffic especially on my second run in the first two parts of qualifying the car felt good as can be seen from my times but then i never managed to prepare the tyres in the best way clearly overtaking isnt easy but we have a good pace and i will try and exploit that in fighting with the two drivers ahead of me on the grid
520790 i made a mistake on my final flying lap which cost me time and that followed on from not having got a great lap on my previous attempt which explains why im sixth of course i am not happy and starting from the third row my race will be an uphill struggle i will try and make the most of this situation given that the car today was not that bad we are going through a bit of a difficult time but we mustnt give up all we need to do is put together all the pieces of the jigsaw and then the results will come to us again
520791 obviously we cannot be happy with this result especially when our main opponents have the front row to themselves our main aim this weekend was and still is to get the most out of our car tyre team package and today we failed to do that especially in the final part of qualifying now we have to try and do it in tomorrows race it will be tough because our grid positions are not the best and we are up against very strong opposition but it is not an impossible task we have strong potential which we saw today it will be a case of getting all the elements to come together as well as possible

520868 regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation that may prevail in each the nation is always conceived as a deep horizontal comradeship

520872 a classs victory therefore benefits also many individuals of the other classes which are not winning a dominant position but only insofar as it now puts these individuals in a position to raise themselves into the ruling class every new class therefore achieves its hegemony only on a broader basis of than that of the class ruling previously

520877 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues

520879 im giving the maximum donation to obama then it might have been hypocritical this wasnt an announcement it was a reporter doing his job and kpd i think you are simply looking for an argument if you believe that article was in any way slanted towards either of the candidates
520880 barack obama is the kindest bravest warmest most wonderful human being ive ever known in my life
520881 boy he can put up a triple double at will im going to vote the way he votes

520890 he asked why are the yankees always so good every video game we get theyve got the best team i explained to him that they spend a lot of money on players if a player is really good they try to trade for him usually they have kind of an all star team
520891 about two months later i was signing autographs he said dead serious why would anyone want your autograph he said youre not any good youre just average
520892 i said ive been pitching in the big leagues about 10 years ive done this and that he said dad if you were any good the yankees would have traded for you
520893 id be lying if i said i thought it would happen like it has here in the past year

521113 i always figured when i got older god would sorta come inta my life somehow and he didnt i dont blame him
521114 it was like we was both back in older times and i was on horseback goin through the mountains of a night goin through this pass in the mountains it was cold and there was snow on the ground and he rode past me and kept on goin never said nothin goin by he just rode on past and he had his blanket wrapped around him and his head down and when he rode past i seen he was carryin fire in a horn the way people used to do and i could see the horn from the light inside of it bout the color of the moon and in the dream i knew that he was goin on ahead and he was fixin to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold and i knew that whenever i got there he would be there
521115 when my agent called to tell me that my novel cures for heartbreak had sold to a publisher she said i have good news and bad news the good news an editor at random house had read it overnight and made an offer at 7 30 a m the bad news the editor worked at random house childrens books
521116 well cant the publishers just tell the bookstores to stock the books in both sections
521117 thou shalt purchase this book and stock it in many sections for we have spoken
521118 the real problem is that adults dont think they should be reading young adult literature and a lot of them havent caught on yet to the fact that theyre allowed to walk down that aisle of the bookstore
521119 isnt the main difference just where the marketing dollars are coming from
521120 why is she still reading kids books what is that about thats really really freaky
521121 i must be living in a lovely cocoon i honestly have not experienced the kind of snobbery margo rabb describes in the article i suspect thats because pretty much all the publishing people i know are ya people whereas most of the people quoted in the article either come out of the adult literary world or aspired to write for adults
521122 im glad adults are warming up to teen literature but i also know that publishing is a business and that adults far outweigh teens in buying power
521123 the question really isnt is ya worthy of my efforts
521124 the real problem is that adults dont think they should be reading young adult literature and a lot of them havent caught on yet to the fact that theyre allowed to walk down that aisle of the bookstore

521126 implements a new holiday to accommodate the muslim workers at the plant
521127 the five year contract creates an additional paid holiday iidal fitil a muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of ramadan
521128 the new contract includes eight paid holidays which is the same number provided in the old contract
521129 however the union leadership did request and receive eid al fitr which is apparently spelled various ways including id al fitr and eid ul fitr as a paid holiday in place of labor day
521130 since all team members will still have eight paid holidays the change will not affect production
521131 is distinguished by the performance of communal prayer salat at daybreak on its first day it is a time of official receptions and private visits when friends greet one another presents are given new clothes are worn and the graves of relatives are visited
521132 eid al fitr is one of eight paid holidays for all team members covered by the contract while labor day is not a paid holiday
521133 based on the contract the other paid holidays include the team members birthday new years day martin luther king jr day memorial day independence day thanksgiving day and christmas day
521134 implementing this holiday was a challenge since it falls on a different day every year and is declared on fairly short notice
521135 but the negotiating committee felt this was extremely crucial since this holiday is as important to muslims as christmas is to christians
521136 the date for this holiday eid al fitr is not the same each year
521137 all team members who have completed their probationary period are eligible for all eight paid holidays including eid al fitr
521138 two prayer rooms have been created to allow muslim workers to pray twice a day and return to work without leaving the plant
521139 does have a prayer room to accommodate the needs of muslim team members
521140 in addition to regular non paid breaks all team members are allotted a seven minute paid break
521141 tyson foods drops labor day for islamic eid al fitr adds prayer rooms

521147 following our football supporters international congress at the emirates last month we were pointed in the direction of eurostand 2008 who have been campaigning on issues around safe standing as have we this year the agenda of the eurostand campaign has been extended and there will be two days of action due to take place on 13 and 14 september 2008 fans from all over europe are planning to bring banners and flags with the eurostand 08 logo on and hold them up in protest their logo can be downloaded from here well be including a european review of the actions in future tfss but should you wish to get involved email info eurostand08 com perhaps now is the time to make it clear to the club and authorities that there are those who want safe standing

521149 this ordinance is in no way attempting to tell people what to eat but rather responding to the need to attract sit down restaurants full service grocery stores and healthy food alternatives ultimately this ordinance is about providing choices something that is currently lacking in our community

521159 i hate to tell you but i kinda doubt it when he is just regurgitating misleading talking points like
521160 human activity is responsible for only 3 2 percent of co2
521161 also and unrelated question if the earth and oceans havent warmed for the past several years why does the co2 keep going up dont the oceans release co2 as the earth warms thanks in advance
521162 almost any scientist who knows or has it explained to him how that misleading figure was arrived at is going to be completely horrified

521173 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

521184 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
521185 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
521186 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
521187 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
521188 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
521189 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
521190 if weve got a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like then obviously thats something that i would consider because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
521191 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
521192 thats how we can protect our coastline and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good
521193 its not going to provide short term relief or medium term relief or in fact long term relief it wont drop prices in this administration or in the next administration or in the administration after that
521194 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
521195 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
521196 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling
521197 the president has failed in his economic policy and now he wants to say but for drilling in protected areas offshore our economy would be thriving and the price of gas would be lower
521198 that hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to relieve the pain of consumers at the pump and to promote energy independence
521199 im not going to assault senator mccains character im not going to talk about paris or britney
521200 i will however compare our two economic visions for the future
521201 i recognize that my opponent came before you yesterday and attacked my record on education reform this is someone whos been in washington nearly 30 years hes got a pretty slim record on education and when he has taken a stand its been the wrong side of the line
521202 he says the reason women dont get paid as much is different educational opportunity well thats not right its not true empirically it is incorrect

521238 one of the characteristics of the line of a ghazal is that it can stand on its own and be understood somewhat like a proverb or saying however if you look at a ghazal like a piece of music in which each lien ads something to the whole thought rather than like a story that needs to make sense then you can begin to understand how the poem holds together the unity of the ghazal is based on the idea of a theme and its variations

521364 the proposal was a surprise its not how i saw myself spending my retirement
521365 but i saw it as an important chance to do a bit of national service
521366 its clear to all south africans that the major error was in the failure to add to the south african generation capacity
521367 business leaders certainly were aware of an approaching energy crunch and could have and should have done more to focus the nations attention
521368 what i am interested in is getting a better understanding of what went wrong and what we need to do going forward to prevent the same thing happening again
521369 the challenge to government as an owner is to maintain the business in a state of readiness to meet the needs of the future
521370 the recently agreed loan is a good example of what is needed
521371 we need to invest constantly and reinvest if south africa is to meet its power needs
521372 eskoms reserve margin is paper thin we saw that last week
521373 to make it through the balance of winter we need to manage our way through peak demand
521374 this will require voluntary action from all consumers to manage their peak usage
521375 i suspect that south africa will need to look at every source of energy
521376 we cant rely solely on coal but this is not to say that coal will go away
521377 the concepts are already there in terms of co generation ipps independent power producers power buy backs
521378 the regulatory environment is relatively new but if south africa wants to meet its millennium development goals we need to grow power generation capacity
521379 we believe there must be contingency plans until such time as the country has a sufficient number of qualified maths teachers
521380 in the past we used to have higher and standard grade versions where learners with a high degree of competency in maths would take it on higher grade while those who struggle would take it on standard grade
521381 it allowed learners to build skills and knowledge without the more rigorous conceptual demands of higher grade we argue that this option should not be lost to learners as it provided entrance to universities of technology in careers such as engineering architecture construction studies and business studies to mention a few
521382 once again here we have an instance where good curriculum ideas run ahead of implementation realities in the case of mathematical education we simply do not have enough teachers with the depth of subject matter knowledge
521383 in the process we lost many potential higher grade passes
521384 prevented mobility for standard grade learners to upgrade to higher grade
521385 it is mind boggling why the curriculum developers ignored the intermediate maths options and introduced only two very extreme options
521386 most stressful and disturbing year as most learners were struggling with most concepts this broke their spirit
521387 some even rise and say i am right i will rape and there will be aids and i will shower
521388 to spend time with my children for the first time in 13 years since i moved to johannesburg as sadtu president
521389 it is high time that workers know the trade union is theirs they formed the unions and they pay each month for the union to survive they should be dictating what happens

521395 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
521396 and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues

521398 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on

521409 over the last five years there has been a ceding of control to other agencies and local governments without clear coordination and control of such efforts and this has only served to exacerbate the bad situation
521410 lakes like edward and george hardly produce any fish while lake kyoga fisheries production has dropped from 167 000 tonnes in the1980s to less than 55 000 tonnes annually in 2006
521411 calling off excessive fishing efforts by providing packages for alternative livelihoods for fishermen who opt out voluntarily is one of the measures we are going to effect
521412 this will therefore mean that access to the fishing occupation will be limited to those who are trained and certified
521413 this has happened at a time when operational costs have greatly increased due to the intermittent power supply and increased cost of fuel and freight charges
521414 regionally the expanded east africa community presents a very good opportunity for fish markets but given the limited fisheries resources this has also created an added threat as regional fish traders push to take advantage of the new markets
521415 these projections make the total requirement for food fish for the country 825 000 tonnes of which the natural current stocks provide only 430 000 tonnes 55 per cent consists of fish less preferred by the local market

521488 esa resoluci n no es l gica suena metalizada es decir a dinero
521489 the nile perch is the major traded fisheries commodity internationally its decline presents a special concern for livelihoods of millions around the lake and the region
521490 the lake provides livelihood to thousands of fishermen and women some coming from as far as mtwara in the southern highlands mwanza in the lake victoria zone coast region and arusha
521491 in 2006 water came to as far as my threshold but now as you can see the shoreline seems to be very far away
521492 this is not uncommon most of the time we receive calls about floating bodies but upon reaching the scene we cannot trace the bodies
521493 we have heard allegations that the fishermen usually tether the bodies to rocks and use them to attract fish for their catch they also reportedly use the bodies to get ransom from relatives of the deceased when they claim to be looking for it under the water for days
521494 i recall some time in 2006 there was a body around my fishing area we had not tied it anywhere but there was a lot of fish around it
521495 after all its a dead body and i did not kill the person
521496 when there is a dead body in the lake fish come in droves so when a fisherman says he cant fish around that spot he is lying
521497 we hear that yesteryear fishermen used to do it but i dont believe there are still fishermen who do it today
521498 it is true that fishermen can hide a dead body in the water to improve their catch over the days
521499 it is not our fault that the police almost always come to do their work days later
521500 the by law which is yet to be approved will restrict any fisherman from fishing in the vicinity of a dead body
521501 the direction for flower was decidely more adult and a progression of my work on intimacy and affairs of the heart
521502 adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions
521503 i regret that it now appears bocog beijings olympic organizers has announced that there will be limitations on web site access during games time
521504 i also now understand that some ioc officials negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
521505 me gusta o r de todo los n mero principales atraen a la gente pero otra parte viene a ver cosas nuevas
521506 there are not the same number of fish today as there was then trawlers catch everything throw away the small fish keep the larger ones and destroy the fish stocks for the country
521507 industrial fishing vessels are entering this zone after hours government inspectors onboard vessels are not working in the interests of the country
521508 hide their identification marks covering them with tarpaulins when they run into the artisanal fishermen they run away
521509 if they dont maintain the iez it will destroy artisanal fishing in sierra leone if they maintain it it will be ok
521510 there have been times when artisanal nets have been cut these things happen the iez are coordinates from north to south along sierra leones coast we know where the commercial vessels are at any time of day
521511 in the past one or two months we have had no reports of vessels entering the iez we had about one or two reports a month before that
521512 total destruction to artisan fishing folks if they respect the rules and regulations it would be ok if they dont if they continue to break the rules the fish will not be there the government observers are not honest
521513 fishing is collapsing in this country politicking has overcome the fishing industry people can use influence to disturb fishing practices the trawlers that exist now are too much the trawlers do not obey fishing boundaries
521514 catch the mother and the baby and all will go
521515 this is a major milestone we can share with our sport and broadcast partners who worked closely with us to develop a balanced games schedule that satisfies the respective international sport federations ifs television audiences around the world and spectators who will attend the games said cathy priestner allinger vanocs executive vice president sport and games operations
521516 as with all games the schedule will maintain a degree of flexibility in timing she said
521517 we have to have contingency plans in place for something like this and also for a number of other what ifs that might happen she said vanoc did not elaborate

521521 there is no way mutesa could append his signature to such documents
521522 we have also already compensated 80 out of the 89 purported claimants we have receipts as evidence
521523 i am surprised nape used my attendance list i am not part of nape i held the meeting to discuss resettlement issues with my people but did not invite nape i wrote the letter to the relevant authorities i dont know how nape got the list
521524 they might have got the attendance list and purported it to justify their claims to the bank

521556 the increased value of fish on both the local and international markets has led to increased fishing pressure and heightened illegal fishing practices because of too many fishermen fishing gears and boats competing for the dwindling fish stocks
521557 lakes like edward and george hardly produce any fish while lake kyoga fish production has dropped from 167 000 tonnes in the 1908s to less that 55 000 tonnes annually in 2006
521558 we shall review the national fisheries policy to allow for more competitive and profitable fishing and fish farming development entry of more skilled and trained labour in the sector and attraction of investment especially in the fish farming sub sector
521559 we need to construct a facility that will be able to handle major international conferences as well as offer accommodation facilities to at least 40 visitors during such meetings
521560 the institute should also strive to have practical demonstration aquaculture sites for promotion of aquaculture enterprises along the shores of lakes and the ocean
521561 it should promote methods that will encourage restoration and recovery of dwindling stocks of fisheries in overexploited water bodies

521579 the value of exported fish and fishery products in 2006 and 2007 was d22 8 million and d67 4 million respectively
521580 a major concern of the government in the fisheries sector is about conservation to ensure that our fish resources are not over exploited at the expense of the needs of the future generation it is indeed worrying from recent statistics that our fish stocks are on the decline particularly fish in the high value chain a combination of factors explains this phenomenon which includes over fishing the inappropriate use of fishing methods that put the lives of juvenile fish at risk of extermination and even extinction poaching and illegal fishing in our territorial waters by unscrupulous fishermen and unlicensed vessels

521691 with summerslam just a little over 2 weeks away the action this past week on smackdown was nothing but sizzling here is how everything went down
521692 jeff hardy who last week endured a very personal attack from mvp was sitting at ringside to see the ballin superstar take on everybodys favorite redneck jimmy wang yang before the match got underway mvp said to hardy among other things let me show you how to be a champion mvp won the match when he gave yang a kick to the temple after the match was over jeff hardy came in the ring and gave a warning to the ballin superstar as to what will happen if he keeps up his antagonizing but mvp wouldnt listen to the legend thriller so he shut him up with a twist of fate i guess its pretty darn safe to say that the mean streak in jeff hardy will be unleashed on mvp the first chance he gets him in the ring i believe that mvp needs to learn a lesson of respect
521693 in a non title match the united states champion shelton benjamin took on mr kennedy it was a well fought match between the two incredible athletes the gold standard had kennedy weakened with a brutal shoulder breaker into the ring post but kennedy was able to bounce back after a series of attacks from the gold standard and nail benjamin with the mic check to get the 3 count benjamin was questioned by eve after the match about his performance and the gold standard said that he was suffering from an acute case of bronchitis a fighting champion needs to be in perfect health at all times and not make dumb excuses for losing a match because the next time the gold standard meets mr kennedy it will be for the united states championship and benjamin better be in perfect health it was clear that mr kennedy was the better man than the gold standard
521694 the most intelligent superstar in the wwe the brian kendrick saw action against stevie richards kendrick has become so full of himself since being drafted to smackdown and he expressed it before the match got underway when he told the fans that he never cared for them believe me kendrick the feeling is mutual he made quick work of richards and after the match was over his bodyguard ezekial came in and gave richards a paralyzing backbreaker ezekial could be now what big daddy cool was back in the mid 90s
521695 jeff hardy had a lopsided match when was in the ting against the great khali khali had hardy dominated however toward the end of the match jeff hardy had some fight left in him when he gave khali a whisper in the wind followed by a swanton bomb but just as he was going for the pin here comes mvp distracting the legend thriller hardy kicked mvp back onto the floor and as the two went at it outside the ring the great khali grabbed hardy by the head and brought him back in the ring then locked hardy in his deadly vice grip the referee called for the bell as khali was the winner after the match was over mvp came in the ring and gloated over hardys helpless body this rivalry is going to heat up ive got a feeling
521696 maria made her smackdown debut last night against victoria maria made herself feel right at home as she gave victoria a flying clothesline off the top rope to get the win jim ross said he would like to see a match between maria and michelle mccool that match has got classic written all over it
521697 then the big show took on domino who made his mistake when he took off his t shirt and threw it in the big shows face then when domino went after the worlds largest athlete he got nailed in the face by a size 18 shoe followed by a chokeslam giving the big show an easy win then after the match was over umaga comes in the ring and confronts him and just when it looked like we were going to see an impromptu match between these two the samoan bulldozer chose to save it for another day umaga is looking for the perfect time to face the big show
521698 then it was time for the cutting edge and the rated r superstars guest was the hardcore legend mick foley edge who will be facing the undertaker at summerslam in a hell in a cell match needed advice from foley after what happened to him when he faced the undertaker in the same match 10 years ago the hardcore legend gave him a very stern talking to about what edge needed to win against the undertaker but foley said that if we see the edge that we see today the undertaker will tear edge apart the rated r superstar said that he understood what foley said then all of a sudden he attacked the hardcore legend which lead to a melee culminating with edge leaping off the top of a ladder smashing the hardcore legend through a table i think edge just sent a message to the undertaker as to what might happen at summerslam this match is going to be a war

521741 i try to put last year behind me im excited that i had a great season but this is a whole different year and it brings with it a whole new set of challenges and a whole new set of goals its a different team
521742 i think it was frustrating going through it last year because we knew we had a lot of the elements to be a successful team and be a team over 500 nobody wanted to be under 500 but i think we used it as motivation in the game of football you hope your team stays healthy more than anything if you have five guys going down on the offensive line or whatever we had its kind of hard to go where you want to go we tried
521743 i feel more complete i felt like a receiver last year but there were a lot of holes in my game and things i needed a lot of work on i feel much more confident about a lot of little things having done what i did last year im on a platform now where i feel that i can go even higher than i did last season
521744 i give a lot of the credit to adam tafralis but for me to catch balls i realized this finally as a receiver full time that the offensive line has to block for him it takes all 11 guys on offense for me to catch a ball its going to depend on how everyone does their job its not just me its the quarterback its the offensive line and its the running backs its everybody
521745 honestly at least two or three times a day im answering that question from somebody whether its a fan or another player or whoever it is our own players want to know who i like and who the other receivers like and i always tell people myles eden is ahead right now like coach tomey says so right now myles is our guy whomever coach tomey says is our guy hes our guy i feel like we have four players that are more than capable of handling that duty and doing a great job but whomever is going to be the guy our team is going to rally around him and support him 100 percent
521746 yonus in my opinion is one of our best players with him on our offense it brings a whole new element im excited for him to be out there he makes plays when nothing is there hes a special player hes quick hes explosive and hes a good athlete hes a 1 000 yard rusher in 2006 so im excited to have him back and im excited for the play action pass

521799 the police team led by assistant police inspector vijay powar nabbed manoj alias tilwa valmiki 28 the pillion rider and biker sarfaraj alias sheru sayyed 24 at aaykar bhavan marine lines
521800 valmiki would first spot a woman sporting a gold chain and taking a morning walk alone and then signalled sayyed to take the bike near the woman he would then snatch the chain and runaway on the same bike
521801 i was taking a morning walk with my husband on march 23 2008 at around 7 45 am near marine drive when suddenly two people arrived on a bike and the pillion rider snatched my gold chain weighing 25 gms worth rs28 000 we screamed from help but they disappeared
521802 we have prepared three sketches of suspects based on description given by an eye witness who saw them planting the bombs in different parts of the city
521803 we have decided to not make those sketches public at this stage as it will hamper the probe
521804 it seems that the material for bombs came from outside the state but it is likely that they were assembled here since items like batteries and watches are found locally we believe that the assembly could have been done here
521805 we have seen the television footage and recorded statements of eye witnesses who were present near the trauma centre of the hospital

521809 there are passengers who want to stay in apartments but even they are asked to get original hotel reservation confirmation
521810 they want the hotel in china itself to send them a confirmation e mail which is in chinese language now the hoteliers are charging customers extra money to send confirmation to the embassy in india
521811 and getting a confirmation from them even after paying the extra money involves indefinite wait as they do not understand the urgency of visa

521827 ik moet bekennen dat er lange tijd twijfel is geweest of ik berhaupt wel door wilde gaan met racen ik heb enkele intensieve jaren achter de rug met alles wat er vorig jaar is gebeurd als slot alles bij elkaar zorgde dit ervoor dat ik weinig plezier meer had in het racen en in het sportman zijn terwijl dat is wat ik uiteindelijk ben ik proefde aan het vrije leven wat ik sinds ik actief ben in de autosport links heb moeten laten liggen met name door het hectische reisprogramma van de formule 1 maar ineens was er weer tijd voor familie en vrienden tijd voor dingen die ook belangrijk zijn in het leven deze aanhoudende twijfel is uiteindelijk ook een van de redenen geweest om toch door te gaan met racen op deze leeftijd op zon manier stoppen met je carri re dat had alleen maar kunnen leiden tot onvrede en spijt
521828 wat uiteindelijk een heel belangrijke rol speelde bij de beslissing om voor colin kolles in de dtm te gaan rijden is het feit dat er allemaal vertrouwde gezichten bij dit team rondlopen dit zijn personen die ook aan de basis stonden van eerdere successen in mijn racecarri re zo heb ik met het merendeel van de mensen die voor futurecom tme werken samengewerkt bij het formule 3 team van bertram sch fer waarmee ik in 1999 formule 3 kampioen ben geworden ik heb sterk het gevoel dat ik door samen te werken met deze mensen het plezier in het racen en in het sportman zijn weer terug zal krijgen en ik geloof dat met het plezier ook de prestaties weer terug zullen komen ik realiseer me dat dat niet gemakkelijk zal gaan maar dat betekent niet dat ik er minder voor zal knokken bovendien zal ik samenwerken met de belgische engineer jos claes ook geen onbekend gezicht voor mij hij heeft jarenlange ervaring bij dallara ook dat geeft een goed gevoel
521829 er was twijfel of het wel verstandig is om in een oude auto te stappen maar is een jaar stil zitten verstandiger reputatie komt te voet en gaat te paard stil zitten maakt dat je heel snel in de vergetelheid terecht komt audi heeft me verder het gevoel gegeven dat er mogelijkheden zijn voor de toekomst bovendien ralf schumacher een coureur met een lange staat van dienst in de formule 1 n van duitse nationaliteit gaat met een oude mercedes in dit kampioenschap rijden zou ik me dan te goed moeten voelen om in een oude audi te stappen het past eigenlijk wel bij me hard knokken om weer terug te komen ik heb het vaker gedaan
521830 het mag raar klinken maar de gele vlag zien is een van de grootste problemen die ik tegen ben gekomen je zit constant op delen van de baan die niet in de racelijn liggen doordat je in moet halen daardoor concentreer je jezelf automatisch meer op hetgeen op de baan gebeurt dan wat ernaast gebeurt
521831 all courses at all the iits are considered equal but students usually follow popular trends when picking their subject also theres the fear of making a mistake by picking something that is not as popular among students
521832 the escaping of refugees and the fear in peoples eyes in the movie took me back to a journey that i once experienced myself
521833 its a movie that describes a day of a child soldier in a battlefield i would love to add the moments before a child soldier goes to war and how they feel when they lose a battle and a couple of their friends the real battle is not when you are fighting its when you have left the war and you have to deal with the nightmares and the boredom
521834 we really sensed the governments support its desire to welcome us its need to give testimony
521835 for liberians it was a way to assess before the international community that they had moved on that they had turned the page after 15 years of war
521836 it was primordial for me to work with ex child soldiers who seemed to be the only ones capable of giving a sincere testimony of this horror
521837 with the aim of bringing framework and support to the young actors of the johnny mad dog movie
521838 it was unimaginable for me to reproduce the scheme the children had known during the war the general comes takes the children and abandons them as soon as its over i wanted to continue following the childrens progress trying to help them in their reinsertion into society
521839 it is a place where they know they can turn to to eat attend courses sleep and be listened to

521864 we are proud of our renovated and expanded libraries such as the swem and the wolf law library
521865 while rankings and polls never capture the total character of a close knit campus community such as william and mary when we appear on lists such as princeton reviews best libraries it does give us a sense of pride since these rankings are based on undergraduate surveys

521975 i have been watching his films since i was a child and today i must say that i know hindi thanks to him
521976 we love shah rukh as he transports us into a different world altogether with his movies he also has a very unique personality that can cut across all language and geographical boundaries i remember his movie dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge he was simply superb in it we hope he comes again to sri lanka and i know the people here will give him a royal welcome
521977 its an introspective study about srk the human being the actor and film personality hes openly talked about his life his idols and also about how exciting his journey from television to cinema has been he has spoken about his seniors contemporaries and has not made any controversial statements about anyone
521978 for me the most exciting experience was to see the child in him as he would go down memory lane during each of the sittings
521979 each chapter starts with a quote from shah rukh there are so many facets of his life he personifies the best that a mother would want in her son a girlfriend would dream of in her lover a wife would want in her husband and a child would want in his father
521980 we received a tremendous response for still reading khan but priced at rs 3 000 it was beyond the reach of an srk admirer from among the masses this book is specially developed and designed keeping both the masses and classes in mind

521985 ich kann das wort druck nicht mehr h ren wenn du dieses schwierige spiel in der 95 minute gewinnst werden nat rlich emotionen frei vor dem spiel habe ich gesagt nach dem spiel m ssen wir drei punkte mehr haben das ist passiert
521986 kompliment an meine mannschaft sie haben alles gegeben wenn du hier gewinnen willst musst du zwei drei tore schie en wir werden allen beweisen dass wir kein abstiegskandidat sind der schiri hat viel wirbel hineingebracht der herr hofmann wird austria k rnten nie wieder pfeifen
521987 wir h tten relativ einfach 5 0 oder 6 0 gewinnen k nnen haben aber einige chancen nicht verwertet es ist das recht der mannschaften hier in salzburg so zu spielen dass sie nur 0 1 oder 0 2 verlieren kompliment an altach f r die ersten f nf minuten danach haben sie aber nur mehr verteidigt wir hatten 70 prozent ballbesitz das ist unglaublich
521988 nelisse kann noch viel besser spielen er muss sich erst an den kunstrasen und den typisch sterreichischen fu ball gew hnen die verletzung bei zickler ist nicht so schlimm aber zehn bis 14 tage wird er uns schon fehlen
521989 wir haben 3 0 gewonnen und die tabellenf hrung geholt nat rlich bin ich da sehr gl cklich es war sehr schwer f r uns denn altach stand mit sehr vielen spielern im strafraum aber wir haben geduldig auf unsere chancen gewartet und drei treffer erzielt
521990 im endeffekt hat sich einfach die qualit t durchgesetzt ein gro er gegner f r uns beim verteidigen ist hier auch der unglaublich schnelle kunstrasen gewesen k mpferisch war unsere leistung top aber nach vorne haben wir unsere probleme und das leider nicht zum ersten mal wir haben gewusst wenn wir hier auf diesem platz mitspielen wollen kann es auch zweistellig werden wir werden schon unsere punkte holen
521991 mit zwei mann mehr war es nicht so leicht ried hat die r ume gut eng gemacht wir haben dagegen kein mittel gefunden wir waren einfach nicht clever genug vor ein paar tagen haben wir gegen salzburg 0 6 verloren das ist nat rlich noch in den k pfen drin heute hat nur der sieg gez hlt und es war das wichtigste das zu erreichen
521992 man muss das resultat heute zweitrangig sehen und auf den charakter der mannschaft schauen darauf kann man aufbauen und das gibt auch entscheidungshilfen f r die kommenden spiele
521993 die zuschauer sind bei diesem spiel voll auf ihre rechnung gekommen das waren 90 minuten mit gro er leidenschaft so werden viele fans zu den spielen in die stadien kommen irgendwie mussten wir immer hinterher laufen obwohl wir gen gend chancen hatten wir h tten das spiel f r uns entscheiden k nnen aber bei zweimaligem r ckstand muss man mit dem 2 2 irgendwie auch zufrieden sein salzburg hat in unterzahl perfekt gespielt daf r haben sie gen gend qualit t und erfahrung aber wir haben das abgerufen was uns in der meistersaison stark gemacht hat wir spielen fu ball und lassen uns sicher nicht aus der bahn werfen
521994 die vorarbeit war wichtiger als das tor ich musste nur noch vollenden leider haben wir nur unentschieden gespielt das sind zwei verlorene punkte das qu ntchen gl ck hat gefehlt aber den fans wurde kampf leidenschaft und begeisterung geboten sie haben ein sehr gutes spiel gesehen salzburg ist ein team das mitspielt das kommt uns entgegen
521995 ich bin froh ber dieses spiel von beiden mannschaften es war sehr angenehm zuzuschauen wir waren 20 minuten sehr gut und hatten viele chancen danach wurde rapid besser und besser und wir haben noch dazu janko verletzt verloren wir sind nach wien gekommen um drei punkte zu machen das ist nicht gelungen deshalb bin ich unzufrieden die rote karte von ngwat mahop wird sicher konsequenzen haben das werden wir intern l sen auch in der vorbereitung sah er rot aber er hat nichts gelernt das war sehr sehr dumm ich werde die offensive spielweise auch ausw rts beibehalten das habe ich schon mehrmals gesagt jeder trainer hat seinen stil jeder maler hat seinen stil rembrandt machte ja auch nicht auf einmal einen van gogh
521996 die verletzung ist nicht schlimm der muskel hat ein wenig zugemacht f rs uefa cup match am donnerstag k nnte es knapp werden aber am kommenden wochenende sollte es wieder passen ich freue mich dass ich derzeit so gut treffe aber im endeffekt z hlt nur wie es am ende der saison ausschaut das thema em ist jetzt schon so oft angesprochen worden ich bin niemandem b se teamchef hickersberger musste eine entscheidung treffen und hat sich so entschieden im nachhinein sind immer alle gescheiter das ist typisch sterreichisch
521997 das war nicht sch n die austria hat die r ume gut zugestellt klug gespielt unsere b lle waren zu langsam in der defensive haben wir zu langsam agiert die spieler haben in der zweiten h lfte alles versucht aber nat rlich m ssen wir uns verbessern wir haben die erste h lfte verschlafen die austria war die klar bessere mannschaft ich wollte wemmer eigentlich schon ein bisschen fr her runterholen leider ist er berhaupt nicht ins spiel gekommen
521998 wir waren heute klar die bessere mannschaft der lask hat es nach schlechtem spiel mit der brechstange probiert es wird zu oft nach dem resultat beurteilt aber wir haben in den ersten beiden spielen nicht gut gespielt der sieg freut mich und hat mich befreit
521999 es war eine taktisch tadellose leistung von uns sicher war beim siegestreffer auch gl ck dabei ich bin nicht so ein goalgetter aber es freut mich dass es gelungen ist im vorigen jahr habe ich gercaliu auf meiner position gehabt heuer sun xiang es ist nicht so leicht bei der austria in der vorbereitung war ich zudem verletzt
522000 das war mit sicherheit nicht der trainereffekt ich habe eigentlich zwei gleich starke mannschaften gesehen aufgrund der torchancen haben wir aber verdient gewonnen
522001 wir wollten heute einfach gewinnen dass ich auch noch das 2 1 geschossen habe ist einfach wunderbar die kapfenberger sind weit drinnengestanden wir haben uns lange zeit schwergetan aber der sieg z hlt
522002 ich habe eine mannschaft gesehen die unentschieden h tte spielen k nnen ein eigenfehler hat uns das remis gekostet ein kopfball darf nie ins zentrum zur ckgek pfelt werden bei diesen fans ist dann auch ein bisschen nervenflattern dazugekommen mir tut es leid aufgrund der einstellung und des kampfgeistes h tte sich die mannschaft ein remis verdient wir zahlen lehrgeld die qualit t der einzelspieler von ried ist so dass sie ein spiel entscheiden k nnen
522003 nach diesem spiel muss ich gl cklich sein wir haben alles gegeben wir haben gewusst dass es nicht einfach wird altach ist eine k mpferische mannschaft wir haben auch spielerisch berzeugt haben schnell gespielt und sind in der abwehr gut gestanden wir haben jetzt zwei heimspiele die nicht einfach werden aber wir sind in einer guten ausgangsposition
522004 es war ein sehr sehr schwieriges spiel altach hat uns alles abverlangt und ist in der zweiten h lfte st rker geworden durch den anschlusstreffer haben sie einen zus tzlichen schub bekommen
522005 die qualit t des lask hei t ivica vastic er hat den lask mit zwei sensationellen aktionen in f hrung gebracht f r uns ist es als k mpferische mannschaft dann schwierig das spiel zu machen dem team geb hrt dennoch ein kompliment die spieler kommen teilweise aus der ersten liga m ssen sich erst eingew hnen die zweite h lfte war sehr in ordnung wir sind rund um die uhr dran spieler zu testen aber es ist nicht leicht wir m ssen auch an die wirtschaftliche seite denken
522006 wir haben in der ersten halbzeit zu viel respekt gehabt und nicht so gespielt wie wir uns das vorgestellt haben wir wollten zu null spielen das tor war f r mich eine situation aus dem nichts heraus das bild in der ersten halbzeit war f r mich genau so wie das eines aufsteigers der sich nicht traut in der zweiten halbzeit hat die mannschaft dann aber gezeigt was sie kann
522007 wir haben uns tapfer gehalten aber in der ersten halbzeit leider ein sehr dummes tor bekommen in dieser liga wird jeder fehler bestraft das tempo ist h her als in der ersten liga
522008 wir haben zu wenig attackiert die 1 0 f hrung zur pause war aber verdient nach der pause hat kapfenberg mit langen b llen druck gemacht aber wir sind sehr sicher gestanden ich bin mit dem ergebnis und dem spiel zufrieden die jungen spieler haben sich sehr gut integriert
522009 ein tor beim bundesliga deb t etwas besseres gibt es nicht das h tte ich mir vor dem spiel nicht tr umen lassen wir haben hektisch begonnen uns in der zweiten halbzeit etwas zur ckgezogen aber wenn man gewinnt ist immer alles sch n und in ordnung
522010 am meisten freude hat mir gemacht wie mir karl daxbacher gratuliert hat das ist ein kompliment wenn dir der trainer vom gegner gratuliert hei t das dass man gut gespielt hat demnach haben wir uns den punkt mehr als verdient chaile kriegt von mir lob f r das tor und kritik f r den verschuldeten elfer die auslosung f r uns ist zum kotzen wir d rfen drei wochen nicht in unser stadion nur weil da wer drinnen ist
522011 wir haben uns viel vorgenommen aber die ersten 30 minuten waren katastrophal von uns wir haben keine zweik mpfe gewonnen und viele b lle verloren erst ab der 30 minute war ein aufb umen sichtbar aber gespielt haben wir dann trotzdem nicht gut den sieg h tten wir uns nicht verdient
522012 ich habe die spieler in der pause aufwecken m ssen sie haben die ma st be genommen von den testspielen aber das ist etwas anderes so eine reaktion wie von okotie m chte ich sehen er war sicher entt uscht dass er nicht begonnen hat hat dann aber sehr gut gespielt
522013 es war ein hartes spiel wir haben gut angefangen dann ist die austria st rker und st rker geworden okotie ist ein guter spieler ich habe nicht geglaubt dass er so gut ist wir haben einen punkt und das war unser ziel
522014 i believe this to be true with great conviction but at the same time im willing to believe i may be wrong
522015 so when the new christian enters debate especially in religious circles it is done with much humility
522016 what jones does is worship in small house churches or in bars or cafes its public not private but theres no physical church structure

522024 hhs is reviewing a draft regulation that would deny federal funding to any hospital clinic health plan or other entity that does not accommodate employees who want to opt out of participating in care that runs counter to their personal convictions including providing birth control pills intrauterine devices and the plan b emergency contraceptive
522025 the draft also extends the conscience objection to most staff members and volunteers working for health care providers so for instance an employer couldnt punish a clinic receptionist for refusing to make appointments for patients seeking birth control pills
522026 one of the most troubling aspects of the proposed rules is the overly broad definition of
522027 up until now the federal government followed the definition of pregnancy accepted by the american medical association and our nations pregnancy experts the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists which is pregnancy begins at implantation with this proposal however hhs is dismissing medical experts and opting instead to accept a definition of pregnancy based on polling data

522037 sola scriptura has long been the rule of believing christian people even before it became necessary to use the specific terminology against later innovators who would usurp the scriptures supremacy in the church
522038 apostolic tradition is authoritative but does not differ from in content from the scriputres
522039 teaching of the church is likewise authoritative but is only the proclamation of the apostolic message found in scripture and tradition
522040 the holy spirit preserves the church from error and leads her into the truth
522041 scripture is materially sufficient it contains all that is necessary but formally insufficient it needs an intpereter
522042 tradition is necessary because heretics from novation to nestorius have misinterpreted scripture
522043 while tradition is the test to be applied to novelty which arises in the church and claims to be scriptural it should not be imagined that this test can be used to question the authoritative decisions of the church
522044 in the ante nicene church the notion of sola scriptura does not exist but then there is also no notion of a tradition which is superior to scripture or which alters the essential content of the apostolic message as it is deposited in scripture there is simply no way of imagining possible conflict between the christian scripture and the christian tradition and therefore no necessity to choose between them
522045 the fathers of the church spoke as they did because they regarded themselves as interpreters of the scriptures therefore they are not to be made a substitute for the scriptures nor can the scriptures be understood apart from the authoritative interpretation which tradition places upon them if tradition is primitive protestant theology must admit that scripture alone requires redefinition
522046 along with total commitment to the scriptures as the norm of all doctrine a new and clear conviction concerning the authority of oral tradition began to develop this oral tradition handed down from generation to generation and going back through the apostles directly to christ in no way conflicted with the scriptures but it did aid the church in interpreting the scriptures and particularly in summarizing the christian faith and thus protecting christians against the aberrations of gnostics and heretics to tertullian and irenaeus who developed this position such apostolic tradition which faithfully transmitted christs teaching was like scripture infallible
522047 the view of the bible held by the church the early church through luther
522048 the divine scriptures of the old and new testaments as opposed to human writings and the oral tradition or living faith of the catholic church from the apostles down as opposed tothe varying opinions of heretical sects together form one infallible source and rule of faith both are vehicles of the same substance the saving revelation of god in christ with this difference in form and office that the church tradition determines the canon furnishes the key and true interpretation of the scriptures and guards them against heretical abuse
522049 what was new here not the idea that the bible being god given speaks with gods authority that was common ground to both the reformers and their opponents and was indeed at that time an unquestioned christian commonplace like the doctrine of the trinity nor was there anything new in the reformers insistence that bible reading is a sweet nourishing activity for christian people what was new was the belief borne upon the reformers by their own experience of bible study that scripture can and does interpret itself to the faithful from within from the second century on christians had assumed that the traditions and teachers of the church guided by the holy spirit were faithful to the biblical message and that it was safe to equate church doctrine with bible truth
522050 the ancillary view is lanes term for the sixteenth century protestant view in which tradition functions as an aid but not a norm for the interpretation of scripture in spite of claims to the contrary the reformers did not return to the coincidence view the reformation posited a degree of discontinuity in church history
522051 several publications by evangelicals have argued that the doctrine of sola scriptura was practiced though implicitly in the hermeneutical thinking of the early church
522052 moreover aside from these scriptural utterances let us also consider the tradition and teaching and faith of the catholic church from the beginning that which the lord has given the apostles preached and the fathers 596a guarded
522053 you have made a collection of passages from the fathers as witnesses in behalf of your doctrine that the whole christian faith is contained in scripture as if in your sense of the words catholics contradicted you here

522090 six days before the beijing olympics chinese and international organisers were working together on a compromise to unblock more censored websites for foreign media a senior ioc official said saturday on friday the previously barred websites of amnesty media watchdog reporters without borders and german broadcaster deutsche welle were accessible but many other sites were still blocked including those linked to chinese dissidents the outlawed falungong spiritual movement the tibetan government in exile and sites with information on the 1989 tiananmen massacre
522091 australian international olympic committee ioc member and head of the press commission kevan gosper said a working party had been established to ensure journalists could report on games related issues within china the ioc put in place a working group with bocog to start examining one by one those sites on the internet that the international media thought should be unblocked he told reporters in beijing
522092 tested eight different websites and topics at three different locations on friday
522093 the global internet freedom consortium gifc announced today that their anti censorship software tools are ready to help journalists and tourists during the gifc press release 2 august 2008
522094 the international olympic committee made no deal with china on limited internet access for the media at the beijing olympics ioc president jacques rogge said on saturday there has absolutely been no deal no agreement with the chinese rogge told deutsche presse agentur dpa around ioc executive board meetings ahead of the august 8 24 games
522095 the chinese move is welcome although the fact that it has come about cannot be credited to the international olympic committee which has signally failed to insist that beijing takes all necessary steps to ensure
522096 i really dont understand why the journalists need those websites to report on the olympics cant they write their stories by themselves or they need to copy them from other websites this whole thing is just about whining and bashing on china
522097 for ordinary chinese of course the internet and other media are strictly controlled not by beijing alone western corporations like microsoft google and yahoo have worked with communist authorities to block sites that refer for example to tibets liberation movement or human rights abuses in china

522106 if you were to diagnose the best way to go at obama in the midst of this disastrous republican environment you might come up with the tactics the mccain brain trust unveiled this week paint obama as a bit full of himself over confident elitest and out of touch todd writes

522182 its just hard because i always feel so seperated from everyone and so very alone all the time i mean when i find someone i really want to know me i just fuck it up because im stupid
522183 your not alone ashley i know you feel that way but your not alone
522184 i know i guess im just tired of feeling that i am alone im tired of people assuming shit about me and im tired of hurting and im tired of waiting for someone to understand me mom all i want is someone to understand me

522186 mom i just want everyone to leave me alone because im hurting now im done
522187 well maybe you need to re evaluate sp your life and the people in it and decide who you really want in it

522200 when they are able to create children together married people then provide the role models for those children to learn how to become a man or a woman and what to expect of their spouse when they themselves marry

522202 why should married people tolerate the interference of such a government or society in their family life
522203 if america becomes a place where our children are taken from us by law and forced to attend schools where they are taught that cohabitation is as good as marriage that motherhood doesnt require a husband or father and that homosexuality is as valid a choice as heterosexuality for their future lives then why in the world should married people continue to accept the authority of such a government how long before married people answer the dictators thus regardless of law marriage has only one definition and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy i will act to destroy that government and bring it down so it can be replaced with a government that will respect and support marriage and help me raise my children in a society where they will expect to marry in their turn

522228 investors battered biogen idec inc and elan corp after two new cases of a dangerous brain disease were linked to their multiple sclerosis drug tysabri but a number of doctors and patients said they were sticking with the drug and believed its benefits outweigh the risk the two companies lost more than 10 billion in combined stock market value as their shares plunged friday following the disclosure late thursday that two patients taking tysabri contracted progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or pml which may be fatal the patients one in germany and the other in sweden are receiving treatment for the infection

522308 im very happy with the story and most of the songs and especially the singers were great maybe the best so far i think most of my choices were quite unique and personal im not entirely happy with the production though the drums sound a little thin and the vocals are a bit too loud the new album sounds better
522309 way above expectations because this album was conceived in a very dark period i didnt expect the reactions to be that good its also my first album that has entered cd charts in no less than 13 countries
522310 its too early to tell i cant be objective yet the reactions to the human equation were extremely good it was hard to live up to the expectations of the people this time i guess the new album is more of a grower than the human equation is probably because of the many singers i think 01 is a bit heavier and the story is more cryptic
522311 its not a metal album although each song has some pretty heavy parts there will be many long songs around 10 minutes each i will try to work with just one singer this time i have a list of about 10 singers but i have not chosen one yet it will depend on the finished material which voice will fit the songs the best

522332 were not gonna allow racism to come into this campaign in any form

522396 we assumed that telemedicine was a good idea but it hadnt been scientifically tested until now
522397 using stroke doc our stroke team physicians were able to evaluate the patient and help make the correct decision about treatment over 98 percent of the time compared to only 82 percent of the time when doing a telephone consultation to a remote site
522398 when a person suffers a stroke time is of the essence
522399 if you make a poor decision using a telephone consultation you potentially put the patient at risk for a poor outcome

522410 and it flew into a hole in a tree and i said wow this is easy
522411 the young make a lot of chattering so you can usually tell where the nest is
522412 theres a redheaded and hes got a baby with him
522413 see these two trees to the left go to the right most one it forks and theres a broken off snag up there looks like a y thats where the babies were sticking their head out a couple weeks ago it was really cute
522414 were going to measure the diameter of the tree how high the nest cavity is the species of the tree is it alive or is it dead so we can get some data on what seems to be the preferred habitat
522415 if our theory see this is all theory if our theory is correct the golf course replicates an oak savannah and there should be birds there
522416 the woodpecker is called a primary nester it digs the cavity but flying squirrels mice snakes bluebirds tree swallows there are lots of other animals that are secondary nesters
522417 they cant drill the hole but they live there so what were trying to do is preserve the habitat so the woodpeckers drill the hole and when they leave something else will come in and live in it
522418 its a real strange project and man ive done lots of strange ones over the years

522655 the amusing thing about als bread making is that he makes a huge quantity all once in a large laundry basket without the holes and when he adds the salt it too is unmeasured he just fills up his cupped hand and hurls it into the flour i can hardly bear to watch this procedure because too much salt will ruin the dough and too little will yield it tasteless al often presses black sweet olives into the dough when he makes flat bread he also reserves part of the dough for making deep dish pizza if theres some left over i can claim it for cinnamon rolls roll the dough thin smear it with melted butter brown sugar and cinnamon then strew walnuts and raisins on the surface roll up the dough and slice it into rounds and lay them flat on a greased pan right next to one another let rise one hour and bake

522681 if david gives a speech like that hes really going for it all bets will be off
522682 what david has done this week has put down a marker but its more than that
522683 he has shown that hes up for it this time round he was close to challenging gordon last year on mr blairs departure but to be frank he bottled it he wont do so this time
522684 they told us barefaced lies about how they were going to handle the story and that wont be forgotten
522685 david has no real base in the party hes rubbing people up the wrong way with his arrogance this was a deliberately aggressive act made at a time when people were away on holiday lots of my colleagues think he has harmed his chances of succeeding

522705 giving credence to the claim that a lone madman did it
522706 suspect stood to gain from anthrax panic in todays la times with the author depending almost exclusively on gossip and innuendo from anonymous sources
522707 shades of mainstream medias coverage of the anthrax attacks seven years ago when abc news went public with information also from anonymous sources that saddam hussein was responsible for those attacks
522708 the 1973 church committees revelations about how back then u s intelligence services had infiltrated msm
522709 but thirty seven years later why would the intelligence services still be using such illegal tactics
522710 during the last week of october 2001 abc news led by brian ross continuously trumpeted the claim as their top news story that government tests conducted on the anthrax tests conducted at ft
522711 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
522712 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
522713 abc news claim which they said came at first from
522714 there are several indications of deliberate deception in these items
522715 bentonite in the anthrax used as a link to saddam is just one more example of how stupid liars and their gullible followers are bentonite is everywhere a makeup base is being manufactured or an oil well is being drilled
522716 wyoming bentonite is absolutely unique in the world china and india are mining minerals and exporting them cheaply but were still exporting wyoming bentonite around the world because its much better quality
522717 bentonite has more uses than any mineral i can think of its so diverse
522718 a lot of it is behind the scene uses that people dont even think about
522719 the fbis lead suspect in the september 2001 anthrax attacks bruce e ivins died tuesday night apparently by suicide just as the justice department was about to charge him with responsibility for the attacks for the last 18 years ivins was a top anthrax researcher at the u s governments biological weapons research laboratories at ft detrick maryland where he was one of the most elite government anthrax scientists on the research team at the u s army medical research institute of infectious disease usamriid the 2001 anthrax attacks remain one of the great mysteries of the post 9 11 era after 9 11 itself the anthrax attacks were probably the most consequential event of the bush presidency one could make a persuasive case that they were actually more consequential the 9 11 attacks were obviously traumatic for the country but in the absence of the anthrax attacks 9 11 could easily have been perceived as a single isolated event it was really the anthrax letters with the first one sent on september 18 just one week after 9 11 that severely ratcheted up the fear levels and created the climate that would dominate in this country for the next several years after it was anthrax sent directly into the heart of the countrys elite political and media institutions to then senate majority leader tom daschle d sd sen pat leahy d vt nbc news anchor tom brokaw and other leading media outlets that created the impression that social order itself was genuinely threatened by islamic radicalism if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab sent by a top u s army scientist at ft detrick without resort to any speculation or inferences at all it is hard to overstate the significance of that fact from the beginning there was a clear intent on the part of the anthrax attacker to create a link between the anthrax attacks and both islamic radicals and the 9 11 attacks this was the letter sent to brokaw
522720 forensic application of microbiological culture analysis to identify mail intentionally contaminated with bacillus anthracis spores
522721 individuals familiar with the compositions of the powders in the letters have indicated that they were comprised simply of spores purified to different extents
522722 that the spores were produced using additives and sophisticated engineering supposedly akin to military weapon production
522723 this idea is usually the basis for implying that the powders were inordinately dangerous compared to spores alone the persistent credence given to this impression fosters erroneous preconceptions which may misguide research and preparedness efforts and generally detract from the magnitude of hazards posed by simple spore preparations

522725 whats it all about alfie or annie or khanh or saraswati or
522726 constructed and concentrated wealth and privilege in their own hands
522727 despite of their origins as descendants of slaves from the deep south they regarded black liberians as an inferior race good only for exploitation
522728 the construction of a diaspora is an organic process involving movement from an ancestral land settlement in new lands and sometimes renewed movement and resettlement elsewhere
522729 members of a diaspora share an emotional attachment to their dispersal and if conditions warrant their oppression and alienation in the countries in which they reside
522730 it would be a mistake to attempt to understand the history in this case of the african diaspora solely through the prism of the slave trade and enslavement
522731 the study of the modern african diaspora particularly aspects associated with the atlantic slave trade cannot be justifiably separated from the study of the home continent
522732 a journey from multiculturalism to transculturalism which would open the horizons and eventually lead to a cosmopolitan citizenship forces us to envision the world through a cultural prism
522733 trade which began in earnest in the fifteenth century may have delivered as many as 200 000 africans to various european societies and eleven to the americans over time
522734 the western world is perhaps most familiar with the cultural activities of african populations in west africa because this region is geographically closer to both europe and the western hemisphere than any other area of sub saharan africa
522735 the bulk of africans forced into slavery by europeans and americans during the colonial period roughly the 1500s to the late 1800s were taken from this region and as a result the cultural traditions of west africa were disseminated throughout the caribbean and the americas
522736 classification working with the same ideas that inspired the sachs hornsbostel system tuning and educational implications of african instruments
522737 unlike the western tempered diatonic sound which is a standardized sound and does not derive from western language the african sound is strictly tied to the various african languages
522738 bond of music to language which helps maintain the authenticity of african music
522739 the most prevalent style in african vocal music is still call and
522740 the emphasis on the collective community that characterizes traditional african life is in three main activities associated with music communal call and response and the use of polyrhythm we have already addressed this area is instrumental performance
522741 if i lay here would you lay with me and just forget the world
522742 the fbi must not let the death of bruce ivins deter it from completing a full and thorough investigation of the attacks
522743 the chance to prove ivinss guilt before a court of law has been lost but the need for a thorough investigation and a full accounting to the american people remains
522744 if ivins was indeed responsible for the attacks did he have any assistance did anyone else at the army lab or elsewhere have any knowledge of his activities prior to during or shortly after the anthrax attacks
522745 the fbi was always an agency more concerned with style than substance quickly solving and closing a case was of paramount importance thus the strange odyssey of the anthrax case
522746 i am honestly for the first time in my life more afraid of my own government than of any outside conspirators mr hitfill is an example of the inept knee jerk investigation the j d is capable of i fear i am much more likely to be unjustly caught up in some misguided probe by a the feds then attacked by terrorists

522750 its a bigger problem each day because each day more people are moving into the areas where condors are
522751 theyre being pushed into farther out parts of the mountains and in some cases almost out of entire countries
522752 people on the roads talked about when we get freedom how much we will celebrate
522753 we are the children of conflict that shaped our minds
522754 ive seen people butchered before me by indian troops i see that india is not my friend
522755 we cant stay in an environment like this change is necessary you cannot stay in an occupied land
522756 its up to youth to come out and stage protests and change things for themselves
522757 it was quite unprecedented suddenly the people took it on their own shoulders
522758 i dont have any catalogs i need to order some
522759 i have 5 in my purse and biz cards and samples too
522760 ill just keep it in my head i wont forget
522761 fired mortar rounds at the hamas police as well as a rocket at gaza city
522762 these are lies we never fired rockets or mortar rounds hamas is the one committing crimes we have asked all the palestinian factions islamists and nationalists to use their influence so that these crimes cease
522763 laid siege to our house firing mortar rounds targeting our women and our children
522764 hamass attacks undermine my call for national dialogue between palestinian factions
522765 i took pictures of something they didnt like and they removed me deciding what i can and cannot document i dont see a clearer definition of censorship
522766 specifically mr miller provided our enemy with an after action report on the effectiveness of their attack and on the response procedures of u s and iraqi forces
522767 in a sense they are blaming children for their own bad behavior
522768 theyre traumatized you try to hold it in but it needs to come out one way or another now they are reflecting the behavior of the adults
522769 this idea of taking everything to the streets has influenced us
522770 teachers strike doctors strike if my parent comes home and tells me he was on strike who am i not to do it
522771 the sleeping problem that no one wants to talk about is the generational divide in kenya
522772 some of these children were involved in blocking roads tearing up railroads and burning tires and then nothing happened to them
522773 so now when they feel disgusted with something they do the same thing it showed young people that they have some power
522774 they are trying to lock the barn after the horses have bolted
522775 its rare for japanese families and husband and wife to spend time together
522776 if we go back home earlier we will go shopping and do leisure activities and that will have an economic effect
522777 we hope summertime becomes law but there are many people against it
522778 dont you think the economic impact also increases energy demand in my opinion its contradictory
522779 japanese people are always napping in trains and at meetings
522780 bah there will always be people sweeping the litter away
522781 ive paid my tax and the state government should send someone to sweep all my litter away
522782 so we all make an effort to get in touch with what we are all thinking
522783 when you see some of the slide shows some of the pictures its pretty horrifying
522784 its just hard to process the other reaction which all 14 of us had is just start making order out of chaos put the pieces back together its just an instinctual thing for us
522785 its not till the first time you open up a human remains pouch and actually look
522786 you take in the smell and you take in the sights
522787 from this it is possible to construct an artificial mathematical calendar that keeps in synchronization with both the sun and the moon
522788 do not let individuals sections factions or groups consider themselves superior to the organisation we need discipline leaders and members who respect their organisation
522789 our nation comes from a history of deep division and strife let us never through our deeds or words take our people back down that road
522790 we look to your teachings for guidance as we work tirelessly currently to rebuild and re unite our movement which has been intensely affected by a host of organisational challenges

522798 it doesnt mean the end of the problem there will still be problems
522799 most of the children are malnourished they have no land to cultivate and legally they are not allowed to work so it makes it difficult for them
522800 they dont want to go back to burma even though they are not enjoying their living conditions in bangladesh
522801 we were tortured in burma our mosque was attacked we had no security for our lives we are better off here
522802 we are suffering in both places but the suffering is different on that side of the border we lived in fear of the military but in bangladesh the suffering is different food and shelter is the problem
522803 life is bad for us here but at least we can get married we can move here and there we dont want to go back to burma we cant go back

522886 we need to stick with the mission but rethink some of the ways we implement it
522887 nasa has already completed a comprehensive look at possible systems
522888 nasa thinks it would be counterproductive to do that all over again as we are already under way developing a good system for the nation
522889 it was not wisely planned it was underfunded and we rushed into another decision that left us with a gap
522890 and the shuttle as marvelous as it is has not lived up to its expectations
522891 weve turned our western lands into a pincushion and gasoline is 4 a gallon and the price of natural gas has gone through the roof
522892 on the oil side the data show that theres just not that much oil out there in the west
522893 its heavier lifting to build the infrastructure to ship energy from where its produced to where its needed
522894 it takes an increasing number of wells to be drilled each year to replace lost production the industry is running very hard just to stay in place
522895 opening protected areas of the coasts or public lands to new leasing is not going to lower the price of gasoline
522896 no comment on anything related to the vice presidential issue

522899 frankly i was quite amazed to see the quick responses of some of the kids
522900 these children help out their parents who work as labourers which sometimes leads to them missing classes but most of them have the desire to study further
522901 main aage paroonga chahe kuchh ho jaaye whatever happens i am determined to continue studying
522902 i am enjoying every bit of it since it is a great experience interacting with these children
522903 most of these kids are intelligent and can remember a lesson by heart but they do not understand its meaning my effort is to make them understand
522904 by slowly introducing english words in conversations with them i intend to give them that exposure
522905 indians make up 32 of nasa and 35 of microsoft
522906 my wife faith and i didnt want them to go to an elite public school like i did because children in such schools dont get to know the real world
522907 we started in 1978 and eventually had 25 children of various ages the two of us taught all subjects from class i to x
522908 it turned out to be a crucible where our teaching techniques were tested and refined
522909 the standard reply we got was we dont send girls to school in our community schools dont teach anything anyway
522910 when we started in 1988 female literacy here was 2 in 1992 we conducted a survey that found 91 of girls in the age group 5 14 didnt go to school in 2008 this figure is down to 12
522911 hardly anyone ever fails most of our students get above average marks in these tests though theres hardly anyone who has an exceptional score
522912 we constantly interact with the community in order to build trust
522913 a intensifica o do trabalho das autoridades de tr nsito muito bem vinda a percep o de que a fiscaliza o sozinha foi capaz de reduzir o n mero de mortes confirma o que a abrasel tem defendido nos ltimos meses pois a prf ainda n o comprou nenhum baf metro
522914 though judges always get suggestions from the channel they cant be forced to do something
522915 in trying to get their idea of music across the rifts are created theres no difference between these so called reality shows and ekta kapoors soaps
522916 some contestants try all the tricks of the trade they try to get sympathy votes from the audience and come up with sob stories all the time
522917 people are willing to do anything to be in the frame you dont need to tell rakhi sawant to spice up things in a reality show
522918 nobody values the truth in this industry will i get my trophy back if i tell you the truth kyun mera mooh kharaab karwana chahte ho
522919 bigg boss is the baap of all reality shows i lost but i am still saying this so because it is the truth those who say the show was scripted are maligning it because their own image went bad
522920 we need to give people something new we do highlight participants characters but what a viewer sees on screen is actually how the participant really is we also cant ask judges to act in our shows last season salman khan stripped a contestant of his shirt because he was singing salmans o o jaane jaana a shirtless track we cant force judges to do things like this
522921 it is a science and it has rules and parameters the day a producer worth his salt does not depend on judges to fight each other to create interest i will congratulate him
522922 this guys beats are terrible and his lyrics are stupid degrading and barely literate at best
522923 wal mart stores inc is mobilizing its store managers and department supervisors around the country to warn that if democrats win power in november theyll likely change federal law to make it easier for workers to unionize companies including wal mart

522929 certainly we are in a danger zone as far as the toxicity and danger of fertilizers are concerned

522936 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products
522937 as a result our downstream operations incurred a loss in the second quarter with most of the loss taking place in the united states
522938 the history of the social security debate has taught that too many specifics especially during a presidential campaign has polarized the debate
522939 sen mccain believes this is so important that we do not politicize this debate during an election season
522940 john mccain will fight to save the future of social security and he believes that we may meet our obligations to the retirees of today and the future without raising taxes john mccain supports supplementing the current social security system with personal accounts but not as a substitute for addressing benefit promises that cannot be kept
522941 workers ought to have the latitude to take a small amount of their own taxes of their own money its not somebody elses money and put it into an account with their name on it a very small amount
522942 he has not offered very much in specifics that i have seen
522943 obamas website has page after page after page of very specific entitlement increases specifically within medicare it doesnt take political courage to specify the goodies youre going to offer voters
522944 you cant judge campaign numbers the same way youd judge a presidents budget
522945 but i cant see any way he could get there under the policies theyve been proposing theres a disconnect there
522946 sen mccains proposals on the stump are often far more sweeping than the more measured options outlined by his campaign
522947 he has been very clear that hed like to develop an alternative simplified tax
522948 maybe thats because they are on both sides of every policy
522949 the difference in enthusiasm among voters is also a difference in enthusiasm among policy wonks
522950 we were in a contentious primary that lasted a very very long time and was hard fought and very substantive
522951 theres a lot more happening in the obama budget theres a lot more moving parts and i think that probably calls for more specificity
522952 theres a lot more happening in the obama budget theres a lot more moving parts and i think that probably calls for more specificity
522953 im proud that ive won on every tour basically i havent won a world golf championship so it would mean a lot and obviously give me a massive amount of confidence going into the next week
522954 if apple exercised that clause at amp t would have lost one of its biggest points of leverage with customers exclusive access to the iphone nailing the extension is a very big deal
522955 by entering into an intimate relationship with a lawyer who practiced before her and then presiding however briefly over matters in which the lawyer appeared as counsel hartl failed to act in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary
522956 in addition hartls behavior becoming highly intoxicated in front of her court staff and revealing to them details of her sexual encounter with the public defender was undignified
522957 her subsequent conversations with the commission staff and her voice message to the court administrator reasonably appeared to be an effort to conceal her misconduct by misleading the commission and by suggesting other potential witnesses withhold relevant information
522958 when i was a kid there were advertisements in boys life and other magazines for red tails that you could send away for
522959 the ad i responded to wasnt real specific it said my bird would be selected from a falconry grab bag
522960 i wanted a red tail but they sent me an audubons cara cara which resembles a vulture i later traded it to the como zoo for a red tail
522961 it was the only way that meat protein could be acquired for the soldiers
522962 to be given a joint state federal permit requires about a years worth of study before a proficiency test is taken
522963 a score of at least 80 percent is required for passage
522964 during the apprenticeship only a red tail or kestrel can be kept and the apprentice must trap them himself
522965 the bird cant be a mature adult which are breeding birds nor can it be an eyas or baby in the nest
522966 actually i do want to experience some of the finer things in life
522967 what we are going out to do is to learn
522968 this is our last opportunity to visit a summer games before london 2012 itself
522969 we are going to learn about the issues around providing healthcare for athletes and spectators in a live summer games
522970 i am just going to see the medical side of it
522971 it is a case of fly in work round seeing how the hospitals are set up how the care for the athletes in the villages is set up and how the care for the spectators is set up
522972 then we can bring all of our experiences together and collate them and make sure that the things we identify we can solve before london 2012 happens
522973 i think we see people playing tennis every time wimbledon is on but what we fail to do is sustain that enthusiasm
522974 people get interested for a while what we need to do after the olympics is to ensure that interest is sustained
522975 everyone will be getting into the swimming pool or cycling or jogging round the track during the olympics or a short time afterwards but we need to ensure that is sustained
522976 it is about setting real achievable goals for people and accepting the idea that most people who compete are not going to win the 100m
522977 if you can get the schools local community and parents interested you will crack a lot of the obesity problems
522978 there are so many sports that people will look at and think i want to do that and maybe they will join a local club
522979 old photostat copies from the 20s and 30s are shiny like that so this is why youd think this is not a real document
522980 you can see where theyre dipping the pen in to get more ink
522981 since the constitution was passed efforts have been made to uphold the spirit of the constitution this is evident in the attempts to form multi party governments and by a greater awareness of the need to be fair to all races in fiji he said
522982 the constitution is not impervious to change and within the 1997 constitution itself there are provisions to form the basis for negotiations the compact the constitution also has provisions for making changes to it in a legal way
522983 two of these are the requirements to enact are freedom of information legislation and a code of conduct the ccf however believes that these legislations should not be promulgated by the current interim government
522984 in spite of a progressive constitution fiji had two coups this is because the spirit of the 1997 constitution was not upheld currency conversion rates
522985 as a professional golfer thats where you want to be in the final group in the biggest tournaments
522986 i was surprised how good the scoring was because standing on the range you felt the course was going to play pretty tough because we didnt get the rain overnight as expected
522987 it felt like it was going to dry out as the day went on i knew theyd tuck the flags like they normally do on the weekend here so i wanted to come out quick and birdie birdie birdie was obviously great
522988 i played pretty solid all day apart from a couple poor iron shots i pulled and one i hit fat on seven
522989 we have one wish it is to make the beijing olympic games a global sports gathering a success
522990 the beijing olympic games belongs to the chinese people and more importantly to people across the world
522991 i dont think that politicizing the games will do anything to advance the issues it goes against the shared aspirations of people from around the world
522992 focus more on the environment and controlling pollution we want to pay more attention to improving peoples lives
522993 i always like to guess younger makes the person feel better
522994 once you turn 21 age doesnt really matter until you are 65
522995 this form most often occurs in young overweight females in their reproductive years ages 20 45

522999 shayne bannan called me with the news and i was on the table getting treatment with my knee all bandaged up in ice and an electro stimulator attached and he said weve got that second place
523000 i looked at my swollen knee and thought oh good for you
523001 then beyond that for me to go and start the time trial id have to have a pretty stellar ride in the road race
523002 every day im doing the physio and treatment on my knee and every day getting better but well decide on monday morning whether i go or adam hansen goes in my place
523003 i dont want to go unless i can do a good result for myself and the team or contribute to a good result for the team so if i dont recover from my injury and am not close to my best i dont mind staying at home
523004 treatment on cadels knee has been going well and were hopeful that on monday hell get the all clear to fly to beijing
523005 after winning here im far more optimistic now about my chances in the olympics
523006 beijing will be much more of a lottery and ill be much more of a marked man after winning here
523007 but apart from german stefan schumacher all my rivals for a medal in beijing were here today and none of them could beat me thats encouraging
523008 ive had a long season and i wasnt sure of my condition but this result confirms ive come through the tour de france well
523009 we are in a better position at the moment and need to look at one good partnership tomorrow and try to win the test
523010 i think anything above 350 will be a difficult target to chase it is not an easy wicket to bat on and it is deteriorating
523011 harbhajan singh and anil kumble will not be easy to play
523012 since i was a young girl it has been my dream to become number one in the world

523014 detroits one of a kind circus sideshow vaudeville burlesque variety revue
523015 we changed the game plan around and the guys executed that exceptionally well
523016 the next contest is going to be massive because both teams will have an equal amount of edge
523017 the front five especially had a hell of a game they australia never got any front foot ball and some of the tackles that went in forced turnovers
523018 we camped down their end of the field for periods and got the points we were after
523019 the all blacks built pressure and didnt allow us to build any pressure
523020 its the line out performance not one well reflect on with a lot of pride and that reflected the way the game went
523021 the harder we tried the more we seemed to dig ourselves into a hole
523022 well lick our wounds well get a break now for a week and regroup
523023 a lot of false speculation is rumbling around about our company and instead of letting other people define us we wanted to define ourselves
523024 we are re establishing our own culture and identifying our own measures for success based on operating as a single team focused on the common goals of customer first and quality period
523025 our challenge is to return to profitability and profitable growth which begins with a focus on revenue generation and sales
523026 chrysler may be down but were a long way from
523027 we have all worked extremely hard to meet our commitment to commence production of the mg tf in august
523028 we are delighted to have reached this important point and are looking forward to seeing the cars in showrooms shortly
523029 we have taken the very best options from the car that you saw before and put them into one package
523030 if you look at the pre orders that we have had through our dealers about 70 per cent are already sold and that tells its own story
523031 the launch of this car also marks the re introduction of the mg brand to the uk
523032 existing mg owners our huge band of enthusiasts and fans of the authentic sports car driving experience have looked forward to this day for a long time

523044 hey at least it wasnt as bad as yesterdays burroughs film
523045 we saw a energy pulse encompassing you and you were on the deck plating
523046 no its not alive but what i can remember they tried to return home for 300 years but the energy barrier blocked it from happening
523047 i dont know who but i am betting on the people who made the probe
523048 there are dozens of probe general can you be more specific
523049 sorry sir the probe in the milky way galaxy sir
523050 yes sir weve lost contact with the probe about 30 minutes ago
523051 did it get through the energy barrier the scientist kept bugging me about
523052 the technology is primitive beyond our standard and their ftl capability is somewhat slow
523053 we have to retrieve the probe before it falls into the wrong hands
523054 send the henry hayes and john sheppard to retrieve the probe
523055 ive seen lots of families coming together and anytime you see the family coming together you can change lots of things you can change the family dynamics the community and as a result you can change this city
523056 its always good to be able to give back in order to receive you give back its a blessing to be able to give back
523057 this helps me as well as other single parents just lets them know no matter what just cuz you are a single parent you can still make it and move on in a positive direction
523058 the message i would like to give is to find a church it doesnt matter where you are just find one because these days are growing shorter and we all need a home to go to
523059 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
523060 oh really asshole where are you going in such a big effing hurry what the fuck you cant be that important since youre driving such a piece of shit

523068 i dont like it when people easily condemn someone who has an addiction as if he were a criminal as if he were a person who should be persecuted
523069 those who should be persecuted are those who sell the substances those who give it away those who traffic in it
523070 decriminalization of the consumer should include what are called second generation human rights but at the same time there should be a strong policy of prevention so that no one falls in the situation of consuming any substance
523071 the evidence generally shows that the decriminalization of possession is not clearly associated with any increase in illicit drug use
523072 you basically need to get those people out of the underground and into health systems
523073 this would be part of a growing number of countries in latin america where there is either for political or judicial reasons a push toward decriminalization of personal possession sometimes combined with initiatives to crack down harder on bigger drug traffickers
523074 it typically involves both lessening the criminal sanction for possession of cannabis while also providing for alternatives to incarceration for people addicted to drugs who are arrested for drug possession or other minor offenses
523075 the vast amount of human activity ought to be none of the governments business
523076 i dont think it is the governments business to tell you how to spend your leisure time

523235 a skill based game is a web game played in a tournament format with each player paying a cash entry fee to play and with a cash or merchandise prize going to the winner or winners of the tournament skill based games are named accordingly because the outcome of each competition is based on the players ability and performance with any elements of luck either eliminated or greatly reduced this is critical in order to be legal and avoid falling under anti gambling statutes
523236 take the fact that the online games sector is growing at four times the rate of overall lnternet growth together with the increasing numbers online and it is easy to see why companies such as mtv networks are looking to get a piece of the action

523248 the results of our study suggest that treatment to eradicate h pylori reduces the risk of developing new gastric carcinoma in patients who have a history of such disease and are thus at risk for developing further gastric cancers we believe that our data add to those from previous studies showing a causal relationship between h pylori infection and gastric cancer and also support the use of h pylori eradication to prevent the development of gastric cancer
523249 yet worldwide gastric cancer kills more people and there is better evidence that h pylori eradication can prevent mortality than there is for colonoscopy screening preventing gastric cancer by eradicating h pylori in high risk regions should be a priority
523250 this large epidemiological study shows for the first time a consistent and robust association between a high blood level of alkaline phosphatase and cardiovascular death in thousands of dialysis patients across the united states
523251 if the association between alkaline phosphatase and mortality has a causal link treatment strategies that reduce alkaline phosphatase levels may improve survival in patients with ckd chronic kidney disease and probably in many other patients with chronic diseases and active bone disorders
523252 in dialysis patients increased levels of alkaline phosphatase in the blood indicate a so called high turnover bone disease which can happen due to hormonal imbalance in ckd
523253 alkaline phosphatase has recently been shown to be associated with increased vascular calcification in experimental studies our study shows the clinical manifestation of this association in real world patients
523254 perhaps the most alarming issue we are seeing with black henna tattoos is the increase in the number of children even children as young as four who are getting them and experiencing skin reactions
523255 kids make up a significant portion of the population that receives temporary tattoos because parents mistakenly think they are safe since they are not permanent and are available at so many popular venues catering to families in fact nothing could be further from the truth
523256 each exposure to ppd re challenges the immune system so each time you get a black henna tattoo or use a hair dye that contains ppd there is an increased risk of having a reaction
523257 many people are sensitized to ppd but dont have a reaction to it however each time you are exposed to black henna you increase your risk of developing a lifelong allergy to it
523258 unless the artist can tell you exactly whats in the tattoo dont get one
523259 the use of cannabis as a therapeutic agent in multiple sclerosis is controversial
523260 the potential risks of smoked cannabis in this population had not been studied previously
523261 slowness of thought and memory disturbance affect about one half of multiple sclerosis patients as it is
523262 patients also have high rates of psychological difficulties such as major depression which at the extreme end of the spectrum may lead to suicidality
523263 the finding that regular use of street cannabis by multiple sclerosis patients is associated with yet further cognitive and psychiatric problems is therefore of particular concern

523450 its late in the day and again my iphone 3gs battery is running low
523451 that makes this an apt time to take a fresh look at an increasingly important part of our gadget portfolio those portable charging devices that provide a shot of juice in a pinch
523452 the iphone 3g magnifies such issues the wi fi connection the faster network speeds and gps features all strain the battery so for the last week ive been using a few portable chargers to keep the iphone and some other gadgets ready to go
523453 it provides a supplemental charge ken klarfeld ipowerrush president said of his portable charging device one of the first targeting the iphone 3g
523454 the iphone battery was nearly dead when i plugged the ipowerrush into the iphone about 45 minutes later i had enough power to make it home a 30 minute commute playing with the iphone all the way
523455 another approach is a portable charger with multiple connectors or tips these tips are made for ipods various mobile phones digital mobile phones and countless other gadgets
523456 one of my favorites is the powerstick a 70 device powerstick
523457 again the iphone was nearly empty when i connected the powerstick it didnt fully charge the device but it provided a longer charge than the ipowerrush
523458 you recharge the powerstick via usb so when its empty you simply plug it into a computers usb port a recharge takes about 30 minutes

523478 they wanted the old ways but the councils answer was simple
523479 no non and nein my dear little links because the bands real war was waged against whose eyes shone with madness and who will soon stand in true judgement of her deeds the council hoisted the flag for equality and justice and pointed out and i think its rather fashionable now days to do so that europe was ours and little island minds had no place in the vast world that ticks over and still fascinates us so

523520 why not its my money i can spend and not spend my money where i want
523521 who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them
523522 i dont remember hearing about jesus boycotting anyone because they believed differently
523523 sex between consenting adults is completely different than the rape of a child or child exploitation i dont think anyone here would condone any kind of abuse towards a child the issue is religion shouldnt have a place in politics separation of church and state that doesnt mean that you cant uphold what you believe it but rather that you cant force others to believe what you believe what if the majority of americans were mormon and everyone decided that the national religion should mormonism you probably wouldnt be happy right
523524 the issue is religion shouldnt have a place in politics separation of church and state
523525 this decree is indefinite without fixed or specified limit time and it will be enforced in the new season in january 2009
523526 it may be seen as a backtrack measure of going back to basics but we have to bear in mind that this is the only way to raise our football standard
523527 in addition after years of allowing import players to play in our leagues they did not improve our football standard at all furthermore some of them did not have any quality
523528 bats flannels straw hats inkpots paint pots beetles and the skulls of small birds
523529 it might have something to do with my evangelical upbringing a way of putting a spoke into my fathers evangelical wheels
523530 there is a definite element of a polarity between me and my dad in the sense that he preached sermons that wanted to bring people to a certainty and its clear that i write books that want to leave you with a cloud of creative or positive confusion
523531 i have this little bee in my bonnet that to stay alive as a writer its a good idea to set yourself up with challenges and not simply accept the same kind of structure
523532 is seeing everybody rush to do a 9 11 novel or a terrorist novel or so on you feel that really there is a commercial desire rather than a genuine interest frankly its a failure of imagination i shall name no names but we all know that very major british authors have made fools of themselves really with this kind of thing
523533 im constantly reading newspapers and just amazed that people feel so secure that they know what the words mean especially words like good and bad its extraordinary that these people seem to know what a good person is surely philosophers have been through this whole problem people go on blithely imagining that they are communicating i also think marriage is a very strange communication system
523534 i think its terribly interesting what happens when somebody important dies next to you
523535 there have been moments when ive thought hey either ive got it completely wrong or somebody isnt noticing who should be
523536 but the important thing really is to learn to deal with it you live only once ive decided to pay no attention and get on with the business at hand
523537 all my work is about that tension between being part of the collective mind and not being swept away with it
523538 its about getting down the river without just being pushed down the river i want to stop in the eddy behind that rock where nobody goes

523542 no hizo menci n ni a los cambios de funcionarios como guillermo moreno
523543 lamentablemente no se refiri o lo hizo someramente acerca de temas muy importantes como la inflaci n la grave situaci n por la que atraviesa la provincia de c rdoba los discursos del campo en la rural o la realidad de aerol neas argentinas
523544 la nica salida es m s congreso libre y mayor justicia independiente tras cuatro meses de una absurda crisis provocada por la tozudez del gobierno y frente las respuestas negadoras de la presidenta
523545 pens bamos que era n stor kirchner pero no son los dos
523546 la soberbia y las decisiones caprichosas solo nos mantendr n como pa s al margen de las posibilidades que el mundo nos ofrece hoy
523547 le resulta imposible plantear los actos de gobierno hacia el futuro
523548 sobre la soluci n de los verdaderos problemas de la gente como inflaci n inseguridad y la energ a no emite palabra
523549 me llam poderosamente la atenci n que nadie preguntara o que la presidenta omitiera hablar sobre el acto en la rural no se hizo una sola menci n al discurso de luciano miguens que fue contundente y que merec a al menos una menci n o consulta sobre que opinaba la presidenta
523550 creo que la conferencia la arm la presidenta para arrebatarle la tapa de los diarios al campo no fue seria no tuvo definiciones y es grave que haya ratificado que no va a haber cambios en su gabinete y en su pol tica de gobierno
523551 su actitud arrogante no es propia de un cuadro pol tico sino de alguien que no alcanza a percibir las preocupaciones de la gente
523552 est bien que acceda a la conferencia de prensa pero eso no deber a ser una excepci n sino una pr ctica democr tica corriente
523553 la presidenta no dio cuenta de los problemas centrales del pa s no habl de la inflaci n y defini que las acciones de moreno son sus acciones
523554 defendi lo hecho en el indec sin novedades en el gabinete sin novedades respecto a lo sucedido con el conflicto del campo sin novedades en relaci n a moreno y sin novedades respecto a la inflaci n que en realidad estuvo ausente de la conferencia
523555 destine tiempo a agenda abierta para responder a la prensa local e internacional
523556 lo que me llama la atenci n es que siga describiendo la realidad desde la burbuja kirchnerista y la gran soberbia que le impide aceptar las cr ticas
523557 estuve hablando con el presidente pedro pompilio para darle un corte definitivo a la situaci n de moreno y fabianesi el lunes ser a el final por si o por no
523558 creo que es un error el gobierno ha tenido muchas posibilidades de salir de esto pero no lo ha hecho
523559 la serie de trabas y requisitos que tiene el oncaa para exportar
523560 que ignore la necesidad de volver a una mesa de debate aprovechando el cambio de funcionarios
523561 los actos que ha realizado el campo se distinguieron por un reclamo pac fico en b squeda de soluciones

523579 during the recent new york city triathlon thousands of competitors were stung by jellyfish in the hudson river
523580 i think the level of jellyfish that we are seeing and the fact that they outnumber the fish that we want to eat is unprecedented
523581 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
523582 no le estoy pidiendo una recompensa pero si usted me da un peso con su mano ser bien recibido

523601 i talked to her after the olympic trials and told her nobody can ever take this away you are representing the united states at the olympics i dont think it will even hit her until later
523602 it wasnt in the cards for us to take jakes two sisters said deitchlers father jason
523603 the coaches called us up and said well do whatever we can to help the support weve gotten from so many people is really humbling
523604 we couldnt go to the olympic trials so we watched it on the internet said kathy koob one of the founders of the ali cats
523605 pretty soon 20 people showed up at our house and huddled around the computer to watch it with us weve watched ali since she was a little girl and we know how much she loves wrestling and the blood and sweat and tears shes put in were all cheering for her
523606 you know what we never rent our cars to the u s soldiers never
523607 right now in the area there are multiple pieces tied to cars being on the road
523608 it s frustrating to take eight different trains to get somewhere
523609 i think it would be wonderful to drive a rental aafes would probably make big money off of that
523610 what a difference between freedom and oppression in one the light of liberty outshines everything and in the other the darkness of the dictatorship is so obvious even from so many miles in outer space

523617 the kind of experience which alejandro was subject to is common
523618 the intolerance is everywhere and people have very few choices where they can go it is a hidden suffering
523619 it is very difficult in a small place like this
523620 i felt companionship we became a family where we could share and where there was no fear of rejection of isolation
523621 it is a tragic irony that those at highest risk of hiv often receive the least attention
523622 the conference cannot be another talking shop that regurgitates what is needed in order to win the battle against the hiv epidemic
523623 a plan of action and a clear political will to win the war against hiv and aids must come out of it
523624 you dont need to disrespect yourself again dont hide your light behind your fear
523625 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
523626 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
523627 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
523628 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
523629 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
523630 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
523631 when you cash your check before noon it throws my balance off

523644 you getting new opportunities you shall decide which to take and which way to go this decision is very meaningful and it may affect your life so you shall consider it very well
523645 you can play a pivotal role in family dynamics a group of your closest friends or at a gathering of like minded people but before you can have a positive impact on complex group dynamics you must first tame the roaring lion from within once you have stepped out of your own way you will already be on the road to a diplomatic solution
523646 thats usually a sign that they really like you if you keep it up for the rest of the month youre going to have a really good evaluation and a pretty good raise
523647 im on my way to sturgis and im 150 miles past hell and gone so maybe its me but all i get are 404 error messages when i try to open a comment on any of folos posts and its hotter here than catherine deneuve in a gossamer negligee

523652 we have a new bridge now hasnt the old one served out its purpose
523653 reduced traffic counts show we dont need so many bridges now
523654 so as it well appeared that famine must still ensue the next year also if not some way prevented
523655 began to think how they might raise as much corn as they could and obtain a better crop than they had done that they might not still thus languish in misery at length after much debate of things i with the advice of the chiefest among them gave way that they should set corn every man for his own particular and in that regard trust to themselves and so assigned to every family a parcel of land
523656 for it made all hands very industrious so as much more corn was planted than otherwise would have been
523657 however people are too starving to overthrow the dictator it is still a green country with pristine scenery and gentle climate what is the key is we dont have oil
523658 shes predictable not spooky shell go anywhere following a bucket of grain
523659 you left some big shoes to fill but ill do my best
523660 do you want a glass or something to hear better
523661 the idea was they would then be sent off to charities and be turned into blankets and clothes for the needy
523662 then one day a health and safety guy came along and didnt like the look of the box of wool and needles
523663 your cow is on the way home doctor is not going to do the surgery
523664 its certain that all the personnel and all the equipment will be sent away from here
523665 it costs a lot of money to look this cheap
523666 they used to separate out my plate my spoon my cup fearing they would catch aids for me that was the lowest point how is such a thing possible
523667 the kind of experience which alejandro was subject to is common
523668 the intolerance is everywhere and people have very few choices where they can go it is a hidden suffering
523669 it is very difficult in a small place like this

523678 id better not make age an issue in this race
523679 if youre not pissed off with what the republicans are doing to this country you are not paying attention
523680 perforo para ypf para ver si esta contaminado el sue o
523681 tomo algunas muestras y despu s llegamos al agua y ponemos ca eria y luego mando la mestruaxion de agua contaminada con el esperma de algun tiradiccionario rex que quedo encastrado por la ceniza piza de un volcan hace millones de a os cuando los humanos no teniamos penes
523682 nah debe ser manu yendo a perforar para las ypf
523683 to believe that he will preserve us is indeed a means of preservation god will certainly preserve us and make a way of escape for us out of the temptation should we fall we are to pray for what god has already promised our requests are to be regulated by his promises and commands faith embraces the promises and so finds relief
523684 jesus took part in this process of constant change by calling people to rethink faith and the bible and hope and love and everything else and by inviting them into the endless process of working out how to live as god created us to live
523685 god after he spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways in these last days has spoken to us in his son whom he appointed heir of all things through whom also he made the world
523686 what would not be known had god not revealed it to his apostles and prophets
523687 that which cannot be fully known or answered the mysterious
523688 its not so much that the christian faith has a lot of paradoxes its that it is a lot of paradoxes and we cannot resolve a paradox
523689 the reformation and the scriptures say that man cannot do anything to save himself but he can with his reason search the scriptures which touch not only religious truth but also history and the cosmos he not only is able to search the scriptures as the whole man including his reason but he has the responsibility to
523690 when you embrace the text as living and active when you enter its story when you keep turning the gem you never come to the end
523691 the bible has to be interpreted decisions have to be made about what it means now today
523692 the authority is god who is acting in and through those people 1st century christians at that time and now these people at this time
523693 this is why binding and loosing is so exhilarating you can only do it if you believe and see god at work now here in this place
523694 did jesus go to school and learn like the other jewish kids his age
523695 no longer do i call you slaves for the slave does not know what his master is doing but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard from my father i have made known to you
523696 of course you would drop your net the rabbi believes you can do what he does he thinks you can be like him
523697 and jesus says you of little faith why did you doubt who does peter lose faith in not jesus jesus is doing fine peter loses faith in himself
523698 there is none righteous not even one there is none who understands there is none who seeks for god all have turned aside together they have become useless there is none who does good there is not even one
523699 but jesus on his part was not entrusting himself to them for he knew all men and because he did not need anyone to bear witness concerning man for he himself knew what was in man
523700 the fact that we are loved and accepted and forgiven in spite of everything we have done is simply too good to be true our choice becomes this we can trust his retelling of the story or we can trust our telling of our story
523701 when we choose gods vision of who we are we are living as god made us to live
523702 and as we live in this life in harmony with gods intentions for us the life of heaven becomes more and more present in our lives heaven comes to earth
523703 whats disturbing then is when people talk more about hell after this life than they do about hell here and now
523704 as a christian i want to do what i can to resist hell coming to earth poverty injustice suffering they are all hells on earth and as christians we oppose them with all our energies
523705 and if your right hand makes you stumble cut it off and throw it from you for it is better for you that one of the parts of your body perish than for your whole body to go into hell
523706 for jesus this new kind of life in him is not about escaping this world but about making it a better place here and now the goal for jesus isnt to get into heaven the goal is to get heaven here
523707 and do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell
523708 and jesus calls us to return to our true selves the pure whole people god originally intended us to be before we veered off course somewhere in you is the you whom you were made to be
523709 if someone wanted to start a mormon emergent church would that be valid
523710 do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure is there your heart will be also
523711 they the bomb squad are investigating the office where the explosion occurred was not manned and so far there is no indication that anyone was injured
523712 i go into solitude so as not to drink out of everybodys cistern when i am among the many i live as the many do and i do not think i really think after a time it always seems as if they want to banish my self from myself and rob me of my soul
523713 in case you missed it this week there was a tragedy in kansas ten thousand people died an entire town destroyed
523714 over the last 15 months weve traveled to every corner of the united states ive now been in 57 states i think one left to go
523715 he did a really good job early on and lately hasnt done so well
523716 he was intent on vetoing that bill when it started through the process because of certain things that were in it and then he signed it after it passed with those certain things still in it
523717 i think that bill was a disaster to start with and i havent changed my mind just because george bush signed it
523718 no he doesnt bother any of us hes not on the ballot were now focused on john mccain and what he brings to the table
523719 look this is a matter for alaska and that legal process
523720 hes asked for an expedited procedure in the courts if the justice department will cooperate with that i think he will have a good chance of proving himself innocent
523721 hes been about as straight a shooter as anybody ive ever met in congress
523722 i said john mitch and i will take care of kentucky you dont even have to show up i think well do fine but i know hell come
523723 so thats a pretty good base of republicans and democrats to work with
523724 si yo tuviera que tomar hoy una decisi n yo no contin o en la pol tica porque ya he hecho todo creo que es poco lo que ya puedo seguir contribuyendo yo siempre me autoimpuesto como una exigencia el sentir que mi permanencia en la pol tica es un aporte y si tuviera que ir a la reelecci n este a o no lo har a de ninguna manera
523725 toda una vida dedicada al servicio p blico entonces quiero dedicarme a lo m o quiero darme un tiempo a m la pol tica no me genera agrado la verdad es que uno lamentablemente est en una actividad muy desprestigiada que es al mismo tiempo muy sacrificada
523726 yo soy una persona que en general no me gustan las campa as por ejemplo para m este periodo es muy desgastante
523727 tiene cosas desagradables es una actividad muy intensa con jornadas de trabajo muy malas
523728 el sat lite la presidenta lo debiera haber declarado un gasto prescindible por lo menos por este momento adem s distintos t cnicos dicen que es de baja resoluci n lo que es muy importante en el uso de un sat lite porque lo m s importante que nos puede dar un sat lite es la imagen ninguno de los oferentes que quedaron seleccionados usan sat lites con resoluciones menores
523729 nosotros consideramos que de comprarse un sat lite lo obvio es que se hubiera comprado un sat lite de alta resoluci n y de alta utilidad y adem s cuestionamos el uso de la ley reservada del cobre porque es exclusivamente para la compra de material b lico
523730 lo que parece raro y a lo que nosotros nos oponemos es a que se compre un sat lite caro como este antes de que exista una pol tica espacial y una agencia chilena del espacio es como poner la carreta delante de los bueyes lo primero que uno tiene que tener es la pol tica y los expertos y luego tiene que evaluar si conviene comprar un sat lite

523797 we can walk directly from our garden on to the beach and we have this lovely variety of scenery the cliffs sea and the sand as well as the marsh just inland
523798 all along our coastline but particularly along the south coast and the south west homes that border the beach command prices off the scale compared to those further inland
523799 there could be a premium of anything between 50 to 100 per cent for a home virtually on the beach but thereafter you lose money for every metre your house is back from the shore i have a house for sale at restronguet point for 3 4 million if it was a quarter of a mile inland it would be worth 1 7 million if it was half a mile back it would be worth only 1 2 million

523805 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
523806 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
523807 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
523808 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
523809 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
523810 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
523811 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
523812 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
523813 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
523814 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
523815 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
523816 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
523817 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
523818 wanted to know where the good press coverage was coming from
523819 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
523820 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
523821 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
523822 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
523823 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
523824 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
523825 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
523826 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
523827 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
523828 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
523829 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
523830 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
523831 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
523832 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
523833 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
523834 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
523835 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
523836 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
523837 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
523838 wanted to know where the good press coverage was coming from
523839 the people of the united states and iowa are wise they understand whats at stake in this election
523840 voting for obama is the political equivalent of bungee jumping
523841 voting for obama is the political equivalent of bungee jumping with a bad bungee cord
523842 the people of the united states and iowa are wise
523843 im not barack obama but you can be sure he approved this message
523844 if at any time i declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that i will pluck up and break down and destroy it and if that nation concerning which i have spoken turns from its evil i will repent of the evil i intended to do to it
523845 if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land
523846 wanted to know where the good press coverage was coming from
523847 very hot when we asked them for more information bush laughed and said when we share information with your guys the bad guys always run away
523848 there are very few people who have their feet in both camps
523849 the c span cameras were gone and the microphones were off but that didnt stop a small group of republicans from taking over the house floor after the house adjourned for five weeks to attack democrats for leaving town without doing something to lower gas prices
523850 wanted to know where the good press coverage was coming from

523858 well sell wholesale what we can and maybe give some away
523859 unfortunately because were a home rule state sometimes common sense doesnt always come into play
523860 i didnt think it was a big deal to sell corn at the end of your driveway farmers dont have time to screw around with small town stupid politics

523865 the gods that have not made the heavens and the earth even they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens
523866 lo this is our god we have waited for him
523867 this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent
523868 that he who in scripture is called god absolutely and indefinitely is truly the only god and that christ is called god absolutely
523869 therefore christ himself with the father is the god of the living

523874 white house correspondent wendell goler was preparing a package about energy i asked him if he wanted stuff from the house he pointed out that it would be a hard tale to tell without video i then ran into mike majchrowitz hes the capitol hill correspondent for fox news radio mike told me he gave his radio recording gear to an unnamed member and persuaded him to record some audio inside the chamber that was a start then i was on a mission we had to get video from inside the chamber ive always known that the best way to get what you need in journalism is to rely on guerilla tactics and like any reporter worth their salt i dont reveal sources and methods but fox was able to sneak in a comvu phone into the house chamber to broadcast live video from inside the chamber this was historic because live video and rarely private video has never been streamed from the house chamber ever but we did that today on fox
523875 oh wow were so clever and sly we snuck a camera into the house
523876 rep devin nunes r calif just pretended to be a democrat he stood on the other side of the chamber and listed all of the gop bills that the dems killed
523877 i am a democrat and here is my energy plan
523878 but i wasnt prepared for the type of shenanigans the gop had up its sleeve on this august 1st
523879 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
523880 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
523881 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
523882 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
523883 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
523884 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
523885 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
523886 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
523887 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
523888 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
523889 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
523890 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
523891 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
523892 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
523893 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
523894 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
523895 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
523896 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
523897 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
523898 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
523899 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
523900 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
523901 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
523902 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
523903 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
523904 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
523905 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
523906 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
523907 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
523908 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
523909 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
523910 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
523911 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
523912 who are open to doing something on the production side
523913 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
523914 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
523915 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
523916 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
523917 hes someone who understands what a commander in chief will have to deal with
523918 hes a republican who crossed party lines he was an obvious choice
523919 he has gut fighting sidewalk smarts that have allowed him to prevail when people said he couldnt
523920 and he did it in a way that they didnt even know their throats were cut until they tried to smile
523921 usually you were hunting trucks and convoys sometimes youd take ground fire sometimes you get shot down
523922 i spent 37 years either fighting somebody or getting ready to and loved every minute including vietnam
523923 you dont want fighter pilots who spend all their time in introspection
523924 i got to know him in the context of cold pizza and diet cokes
523925 that was a highlight for me because it was so personal were not talking national security were watching ncaa basketball on satellite tv were betting on the games
523926 i was tossed out i was tossed out by foolishness in washington
523927 if i had met him i would have understood immediately the guy was kind of shallow
523928 im a 72 year old guy with scar tissue on top of my other scar tissue im not that easy to impress
523929 this guy has just got 20 000 volts running through him
523930 im blunt and bluntness is not the name of the game in politics
523931 its careful calibration and im not very good at it
523932 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
523933 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
523934 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
523935 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
523936 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
523937 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
523938 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
523939 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
523940 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
523941 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
523942 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
523943 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
523944 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
523945 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
523946 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
523947 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
523948 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
523949 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
523950 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
523951 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
523952 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

524002 there are over 4 000 competitive cyclists in the u s only 11 of them are at this level there is no race at a higher level in the u s usually you would think that a road race weekend like this would be held in los angeles or new york city to have this event in rochester is huge
524003 with the success of last years race a three day race was a natural progression
524004 i like the technically advanced and fast course and of course the amount of the people that come out and support the race

524125 sesuatu yang paling aku khawatirkan menimpa kamu sekalian ialah syirik paling kecil
524126 syirik kecil itu adalah raa a yuraa i yang maknanya adalah melakukan suatu amalan tidak untuk mencari keridhaan allah melainkan mencari popularitas ataupun pujian dari orang lain
524127 dan apabila mereka berdiri untuk shalat mereka berdiri dengan malas mereka bermaksud riya dengan shalat di hadapan manusia dan tidaklah mereka mengingat allah kecuali sedikit sekali
524128 hai orang orang yang beriman janganlah kamu menghilangkan pahala sedekahmu dengan menyebut nyebutnya dan menyakiti perasaan si penerima seperti orang yang menafkahkan hartanya karena riya kepada manusia dan dia tidak beriman kepada allah dan hari kemudian maka perumpamaan orang itu seperti batu licin yang di atasnya ada tanah kemudian batu itu ditimpa hujan lebat lalu menjadilah dia bersih tidak bertanah mereka tidak menguasai sesuatupun dari apa yang mereka usahakan dan allah tidak memberi petunjuk kepada orang orang yang kafir

524208 two and half million people were slaughtered in cambodia and vietnam
524209 the relation between the massive carpet bombing of cambodia by the united states and the growth of the khmer rouge in terms of recruitment and popular support has been a matter of interest to historians
524210 however more recently historians have cited the u s intervention and bombing campaign spanning 1965 1973 as
524211 kiernan and owen argue that civilian casualties in cambodia drove an enraged populace into the arms of an insurgency that had enjoyed relatively little support until the bombing began

524214 new orleans got rid of me in 2006 but the vikings came along because they had defensive coordinator mike tomlin who was familiar with me from tampa mike left and they got rid of me a year later
524215 now im here with lions coach rod marinelli who is familiar with me from tampa and vikings defensive coordinator leslie fraziers got safety madieu williams because he was familiar with him from cincinnati
524216 the vikings said they got guys who were better than me behind me
524217 well i led the team in interceptions two straight years there and darren sharper was there with me
524218 so you tell me if they had better players behind me
524219 it probably always does have to do with off the field stuff
524220 i know dwight smith and what kind of person he is
524221 hes a rock jawed tough guy great ball skills instinctive he knows how i want the game to be played and how i want it practiced hes a great addition to our team
524222 you really dont compare coaches because you know theyre all going to have different styles
524223 rod marinelli and i won a super bowl together so naturally our comfort level is better
524224 but ill say the one difference is were early in camp and we havent tackled to the ground yet in minnesota we would have had five six days of full contact to the ground by now why were professionals you shouldnt beat yourself up in camp like that

524234 it used to be that a trailer was an advert for the film now its an event in itself and as soon as they go online people are clicking on them and discussing them
524235 not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
524236 some companies even demand drivers wear ties i do not think it is a good idea because it is dangerous in late nights or early mornings bad guys will easily use it to tighten around our necks
524237 hopefully we can come back in a month and show that the us is the best swimming team in the world
524238 i think it will give our womens team a rallying cry it is something to think about and work on in the next five weeks
524239 as far as the mark spitz thing goes ive said this before and ill say it again
524240 i want to be the first michael phelps and not the second mark spitz
524241 i dont mean to downplay his accomplishments by any means for what he did it was and still is the greatest olympic performance of all time

524253 a nation can survive its fools and even the ambitious but it cannot survive treason from within an enemy at the gates is less formidable for he is known and carries his banner openly but the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys heard in the very halls of government itself for the traitor appears not a traitor he speaks in accents familiar to his victims and he wears their face and their arguments he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men he rots the soul of a nation he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist a murderer is less to fear

524256 people have started coming forward and identifying themselves as muslims
524257 and employers are realizing that if their employees are happy they work better
524258 today you even have leadership and management training workshops associated with muslims
524259 they are trying to climb the corporation into management whereas in the 1990s they were just happy to have a stable job
524260 as americans started losing confidence they stopped fearing their muslim neighbor
524261 we cant discriminate against religion the other is we cant discriminate in favor of religion
524262 it would essentially violate the rights of male lifeguards if we only hired female lifeguards for certain duty

524268 who gets to choose the ice sculpture who gets to take out the trash who gets to make the homemade pizzas thats the little stuff what are you going to do when the big stuff comes along what are you going to do when a tornado hits your house or you have problems with your kids or one of you has cancer at some point the crap is going to hit the fan that is why now before you make the committment you have to ask yourself is that person in the bed next to you worth all the trouble do you love him or her so much that no disease no disaster could possibly tear you apart
524269 we are talking about levels of bills that will be unaffordable for potentially millions of households it is vital consumers make sure they are on the cheapest tariff suitable for their circumstances
524270 if you want to make sure you can pay your bills over the next few years then it makes sense to opt for certainty
524271 we still hear of cases where consumers have received threatening letters that have upset them given the price rises we would expect to see more of these letters and for disconnections to rise
524272 however a company cannot cut you off without a warrant so it is important to speak to them as there will often be options to help
524273 for example there is a weekly scheme that allows you to pay a little each week
524274 we were with scottish gas for gas and scottishpower for electricity and the bills were around 800 to 900 a year but i started to get concerned at the last wave of price increases so i contacted uswitch to see if i could find a cheaper option they suggested we switch to npower and to move onto direct debit

524277 i have experimented with same sex relationships in my life but it wasnt about enjoyment with sarah jessica
524278 her character was supposed to be reluctant about getting involved so it wasnt a passionate kiss it was a reticent one which is the reason i didnt enjoy it
524279 mark vaile left for a good reason and that is because opposition is a very difficult place to be and i think the community will see that its a bit of a folly to be voting our community back into opposition

524300 i can go back to my exercise and reduce whenever i want
524301 so it should still be worth a decent sum and perhaps its still possible to sell before prices slip further
524302 if i sell i will probably be forced to rent for a bit before buying again
524303 but ive not made a firm decision on this yet
524304 but i want to work on boosting my savings now
524305 im really not sure what to do with them so it would be good to get advice
524306 i have to be there a year first and contributions will be backdated to when i joined
524307 if he does sell and pay off his debts hes likely to be left with less than 10 000 after costs and will have to rent
524308 this money may be spent quickly leaving him back at square one but without a property
524309 while he has this level of debt his options and ability to build his asset base will be limited
524310 michael may be unable to sell and even if he does the cost of borrowing has risen substantially
524311 period properties in the right place have probably been least hit by the downturn and are also likely to recover fastest
524312 the easiest solution would be to convert it to a repayment loan next year when it comes out of the two year tracker rate
524313 otherwise he is in effect refusing a pay rise as it will make contributions on his behalf
524314 and in a private plan he could pick and choose the funds
524315 if you are elderly disabled a single parent or have a chronic illness this means that you will have a very hard time indeed
524316 once all the big six energy firms have raised their prices we estimate that around six million households will be in fuel poverty thats the sort of level last seen in the early 1990s
524317 if you have never switched supplier then thats the most obvious first step substantial savings are on offer
524318 companies charge a premium for fixed deals which means that at the beginning the customer is paying more than they would have done if they had stayed as normal
524319 essentially its a gamble if prices rise sharply the customer will make a saving on the other hand if prices dont rise sharply or in fact fall then they may pay way over the odds
524320 the main wastage in a british home is through the roof and walls therefore the biggest single step is to insulate these parts
524321 get in touch with your local energy saving trust advice centre 0800 512012 and they will tell you which energy suppliers are offering insulation in your area people in vulnerable groups such as the elderly or those with health problems can claim discounts on the work some will even get it free
524322 we have made it abundantly clear that firms must ensure their ppi sales processes are up to the required standards and must change their behaviour where necessary
524323 peacocks is looking to get more flexibility from the banks in order to increase the pace of its store opening programme
524324 we have been led to believe that the process will restart soon there was a preliminary consultation about six months ago
524325 ldc intends to sell if the price is right and a process will start in september it has already received lots of calls expressing interest
524326 i cannot give you a date but it will be as soon as possible
524327 i would rather receive the new indictment and have sufficient time to study it and then have my initial appearance for that and enter my plea
524328 of course its a waste of time and they should have amended the indictment before
524329 for years i used to tell people not to choose frames with thick arms because if youre reversing your car youll have a blind spot
524330 over the past 15 years ive kept every single frame weve carried its all in boxes and im trying to find the best way to display them
524331 who would have thought harry potter would have brought them back into fashion
524332 what we like is where the optics model is similar to the uks
524333 in italy or france or germany most people would go to an eye doctor to get tested then go around the corner to buy their glasses we prefer to have a fully qualified optometrist on the premises owning that practice and both testing and dispensing
524334 our typical customer has a very similar profile to an asda customer
524335 we managed to hold prices for 10 years but six months ago we could see people starting to think ive only got so much money in my purse
524336 before that you could not advertise not even an announcement in the local paper for a new shop opening you couldnt put frames in the window with prices on them
524337 you wouldnt believe the things people will tell you if youre just sitting next to them
524338 clearly the impact of the credit crunch and the knock on to the capital markets has to be taken into consideration market sentiment would have to improve from current levels to ipo
524339 an advisory mandate and takes calls from potentially interested parties but that is a very different scenario to hawking it around
524340 at the earliest virgin active will ipo next year market conditions are inappropriate
524341 from around may rbi would say that a sales pack would be ready next week then it would be next week and then next week again
524342 the detail of the cash call came out while wimpey was negotiating with investors and that helped scupper it now the company has learned to keep its trap shut so could yet negotiate a fund raising
524343 it was impossible to get a conversation going everybody was talking too much
524344 you better cut the pizza in four pieces because im not hungry enough to eat six
524345 if you dont know where you are going youll wind up somewhere else

524347 you need to be operated on immediately the position of the bone in your back means that you are in serious risk of brain damage and paralysis we need your consent

524351 im happy to be in the midst of so many asian babes
524352 in fact im happy that the podium covers me from the waist down
524353 like a dress on a beautiful woman long enough to cover the important parts and short enough to keep your interest like my colleague jujus
524354 upon reflection it was a tasteless remark that i now bitterly regret
524355 the following article has not undergone any scientific peer review its conclusions are in disagreement with the overwhelming opinion of the world scientific community
524356 its extremely discourteous its also odd as the journals editors both esteemed scientists approved the article so it has undergone a scientific peer review
524357 where people stated they wished material to remain private we respected their wishes
524358 his energy could concentrate to a pitch of white hot steel leaving behind a trail of awesome ideas sometimes malformed conceived with brilliance but finally unsustainable
524359 latest sign of the credit crunch more neighbourhood cannabis farms
524360 many will feel overwhelmed and worried they cant cope the crunch is bound to affect peoples health
524361 the large ones will not eat the smaller ones rather the fast ones will eat the slow ones
524362 he invited me to have a brief conversation on how we can improve the living conditions in hispanic communities
524363 we are evaluating the proposal which is very interesting as far as the entire hispanic community is concerned
524364 there were no lps cut there was no joint performance it was private meeting
524365 john mccain has a long record and a depth of experience on the issues that are important to hispanic voters and we will continue to showcase that as we go forward
524366 that is the most absurd thing i may have ever read
524367 we are the goofiest people about and say it loud
524368 hey guys pick me to go up against one of the most charismatic politicians in the uk
524369 you have really got to show your hand or we will move on
524370 after the eighth time all the time you are feeling scared

524373 i have a paper on a controversial issue where do i start
524374 what this study found was that the ratio of male to female variance in ability was positive and significant in other words we can expect that there will be more math geniuses and more dullards among males than among females
524375 our analyses show greater male variability although the discrepancy in variances is not large

524620 eyang dalam buku ini juga dijelaskan bagaimana pandangan sang profesor tantang hari tua
524621 kata sang profesor aku berusaha akrab dengan proses penuaan semakin tua usia kita semakin banyak yang kita pelajari apabila usia kita tetap 25 tahun kita akan sama bodohnya dengan ketika usia 20 tahun kita tahu bahwa penuaan tidak hanya berarti pelapukan tetapi juga pertumbuhan penuaan tidak hanya bermakna negatif tetapi juga makna positif bahwa kita mengerti kenyataan bahwa kita akan mati dan karena itu kita berusaha untuk hidup dengan cara lebih baik
524622 baik eyang disini juga diceritakan bahwa sang profesor meluangkan sedikit waktunya untuk meneteskan beberapa bulir air matanya untuk menangis sang profesor berkata aku memberikan kepada diriku untuk menangis kalau itu perlu setelah itu aku memusatkan perhatianku kepada segala hal yang masih baik dalam hidupku aku membiarkan diriku hanyut dalam rasa kasihan berlebihan kepada diriku
524623 sang profesor menangis eyang bukan karena menyesali hidupnya dia menangis karena dia merasa bahwa setiap orang memang perlu menangis dalam keadaan tertentu karena menangis dapat memberbaiki suasana hati sedang yang gundah menangis efektif menghilangkan stressor menangis adalah mekanisme katarsis alamiah jadi menangis itu sehat eyang
524624 banyak orang yang takut menghadapi masa tua karena asumsinya jika sudah tua maka fisik akan makin lemah makin banyak penyakit cepat lupa penampilan makin tidak menarik dan makin banyak hambatan lain yang membuat hidup makin terbatas pensiun sering diidentikkan dengan tanda seseorang memasuki masa tua banyak orang mempersepsi secara negatif dengan menganggap bahwa pensiun itu merupakan pertanda dirinya sudah tidak berguna dan dibutuhkan lagi karena usia tua dan produktivitas makin menurun sehingga tidak menguntungkan lagi bagi perusahaan organisasi tempat mereka bekerja seringkali pemahaman itu tanpa sadar mempengaruhi persepsi seseorang sehingga ia menjadi over sensitif dan subyektif terhadap stimulus yang ditangkap kondisi ini lah yang membuat orang jadi sakit sakitan saat pensiun tiba memang masa tua harus dihadapi secara realistis karena tidak mau menghadapi kenyataan bahwa dirinya getting older dan harus pensiun juga membawa masalah serius seperti halnya post power syndrome dan depresi
524625 act your age but i dont want to act old umur boleh tua tapi semangat harus tetap muda itulah kira kira makna dari ungkapan tersebut usia tua atau masa pensiun bukan menjadi penghalang untuk tetap menjadi berharga baik pada diri sendiri maupun orang lain banyak aktivitas yang bisa dilakukan mengisi masa masa pensiun seperti terjun dalam aktivitas sosial berwiraswasta mengajar dan atau bekerja pada bidang bidang lain atau menyalurkan hobi untuk mengisi hari harinya citra diri juga terkait dengan bagaimana seseorang berpikir orang lain memandang atau menilai dirinya sendiri penerimaan diri seseorang sangat dipengaruhi oleh penilaian orang lain apalagi seseorang yang bertipe kepribadian lokus fokus eksternal artinya seseorang yang sangat sensitif terhadap nilai nilai di lingkungan sekitarnya oleh karenanya valentina hadiwibowo menyarankan agar terima keberadaan diri kita jangan terpaku pada pendapat orang lain untuk membentuk gambar diri kita jadilah diri sendiri dan percaya bahwa kita adalah manusia unik ciptaan tuhan yang diberi kemampuan dan kelebihan untuk dapat menjalani hidup ini dengan sukses dengan mempunyai gambar diri yang baik kita memberi nilai yang tinggi kepada diri sendiri saat kita sudah melakukan hal ini lihatlah bagaimana orang lain juga kita sendiri melihat diri secara lebih baik

524646 with oil now hovering around 125 per barrel and iraqs oil production at record levels sigir estimates that oil revenues for 2008 could exceed 70 billion
524647 nello spirito del principio di leale cooperazione istituzionale sancito dallart 22 della legge 241 90 se tra il 1999 e il 2008 il prof brunetta professore ordinario di economia del lavoro presso luniversit romana abbia preso aspettativa o in caso contrario come abbia conciliato tutti i propri incarichi
524648 e qualora abbia mantenuto attivo il proprio incarico di professore ordinario quante ore di presenza abbia garantito e mantenuto a
524649 e basti pensare ai professori universitari anche brunetta lo che infatti non si contentano del doppio lavoro ma arrivano al triplo e al quadruplo con le consulenze gli articoli la politica
524650 insomma non si capisce perch il doppio lavoro porti lustro e credito sociale al professore universitario e al barone accademico che tanto pi stimato quanto meno si fa vedere alluniversit e porti invece decurtamenti dello stipendio licenziamento disprezzo ammiccamenti e smorfie moralistiche allimpiegato di concetto che di sera si trasforma in piccolo muratore
524651 eppure brunetta crede di essere il nuovo falcone italiano perch nel paese degli abusivi e degli evasori dei conflitti di interesse e delle mafie dichiara guerra al bidello che smonta alle due del pomeriggio e poi a partire dalle quattro va a fare le pulizie in un condominio
524652 e vuole licenziare non il barone universitario che porta in cattedra moglie figli e parenti vari ma loperaio comunale che terminato il normale turno sale sulla sua ape carica di attrezzi e gira per le case di campagna e ora aggiusta un rubinetto ora monta un lampadario ora sostituisce un interruttore

524656 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
524657 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
524658 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
524659 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
524660 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
524661 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obama s magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider

524797 i think we were very satisfied with the presentation of the facts and the resolution of the case
524798 i believe mr foley should be compensated for what he went through it pretty much ended his career and hes a great football player

524860 when clark left the apartment he was immediately placed under arrest by fbi agents simultaneously agents made their way to the apartment to find reigh at approximately 3 29 p m reigh was located alone in the apartment where she was reportedly excited to see the law enforcement officials her appearance has not been altered and reigh appears to be unharmed
524861 reighs mother sandra boss was overjoyed by this news she is being reunited with her daughter and she wishes to express her deepest gratitude to all those involved in bringing reigh home
524862 investigators continue their efforts to try to determine clark rockefellers true identity
524863 understand classical patristic trinitarian theology and its formulations before we wander to new and equally exciting theological grounds
524864 this book is about historical theology rather than about the social history of the first four centuries
524865 offered panoramic snapshots rather than exhaustive theological biographies of the thirty of so theologians
524866 several first rate studies which consider classical trinitarian theology as a significant part of the overall theology of the patristic church
524867 textbooks on the doctrine of the trinity which include ancient medieval and modern authors that are written for undergraduate college students and or general readers
524868 seems to be missing however is a textbook exclusively on classical patristic trinitarian theology a textbook that can be assigned for masters students within the more general courses
524869 we are always ready to help but you must also do your homework and start now
524870 i have always affirmed that football is a game that should be played by everyone with equal opportunity
524871 promoting cultural understanding among the children because football can develop discipline and character
524872 i like my chances against ginebra i am positive that we have a good match up man for man
524873 this is one series id like to have behind closed doors
524874 i am not discounting the possibility of it jaworski showing up to support air21 happening
524875 i will bet on my team if the series is played behind closed doors
524876 but regardless im sure that we will come out with the same intensity
524877 it means a lot to me because i was also one of those when he was named coach who really thought that i couldnt do it
524878 management gave me the trust the last few years and i also grew as a coach
524879 du bist nicht schuld dass die welt ist wie sie ist du bist nur schuld wenn sie so bleibt f r mehr engagement in greiz und anderswo
524880 another example of the bungling thats occurred in the department under labour
524881 im so proud of you we wouldnt have missed this for anything
524882 ive got six more kilometres to get to the zoo hackney bridge and back yet
524883 excuse me young men theres going to be a question and answer session so you can ask a question later let me make my statement why dont yall sit down then you can ask a question thats why were having a town hall meeting sit down
524884 would have a chance to ask your question but you dont want to disrupt the whole meeting just be courteous thats all all you have to do is be courteous
524885 just be courteous and youll have a change to make your statement just relax thats all
524886 that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community or black community of this country
524887 everybody i want everybody to be respectful thats why were having a town hall meeting this is democracy at work
524888 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us can come together black white hispanic asian native american young old disable gay straight that i think should be our agenda all right
524889 of ignoring the plight of poor blacks targeted by predatory lenders police brutality and racist attacks
524890 all these attacks are clearly being made on the african community
524891 i was in the part of the building which didnt collapse with five of my friends immediately after the explosion and we felt flames rising from the downstairs to upper floors
524892 we think the collapse was caused by a gas canister explosion in the building given the burns on the injured
524893 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
524894 the man required round the clock assistance a condition he wanted to change as quickly as possible
524895 the biggest thing is you cant look at the numbers thing
524896 i believe with this organization if youre a good player and you can help the team theyre going to keep you no matter what the numbers are
524897 hes a great little guy a tough guy im pulling for him the deck is stacked against him just a little bit but hes a good football player
524898 charlie did a really good job of putting the ball out there for me so all i had to do was just run underneath it
524899 when charlie went down there thats when they gave it to me
524900 im still not where i want to be but i have a better feel
524901 the key is to look at the mistakes and learn from them and continue to get better
524902 like coach said i had a lot of opportunities because we were out there a lot
524903 but the good thing is they did a good job of conditioning during the offseason so i was able to catch my second wind and make a couple more plays
524904 this thing was like half full and when coach holmgren said let me see you do what you did in the playoffs they went crazy
524905 they were louder than 110 000 in the big house
524906 michael made a great play i mean power to him
524907 pound for pound hes one of the toughest players on this team
524908 weve got to find a way to keep no 43
524909 today justin showed and exemplified exactly what hes all about
524910 it just goes to show size doesnt matter david beat goliath so there you go
524911 the defense closed it up a little bit but the secondary was backed out so i just tried to make some room
524912 anyone with multiple debts and a poor credit history could be vulnerable to the impact of the credit crunch and should seriously consider consolidation while the option is still available the base rate reduction is a step in the right direction but it could be too little too late for people in real financial difficulties
524913 with banks tightening their lending belts more every day people need to keep a close eye on borrowing costs and monthly interest payments because every penny counts an unsecured loan with a fixed monthly payment and a fixed interest rate may be a safer bet in this climate but consolidation must be done properly
524914 people refer to energy efficiency as a no brainier but it seems quite bizarre that some very simple steps are not being taken by companies
524915 i believe that significant savings can be made but it seems that many companies just dont know want they should be doing to save energy
524916 for many businesses there is no need to have lights burning all night and to have air conditioning on 24 hours a day
524917 companies are reluctant to spend money if they are not going to get a direct benefit particularly when times are lean
524918 the message that does not seem to be getting through is that within nine months the cost of fitting energy saving measures pays for itself
524919 some companies are doing a lot but in almost every case there are more benefits to be had that are not being done
524920 it has been rather moist with not too much heat but not too much cold rain
524921 this year has been pretty similar to 2005 in terms of weather so there is a lot of anticipation that we could be in for a bumper year
524922 you see more younger couples getting involved in these competitions which is nice to see
524923 normally young people just want to replace their garden with a patio
524924 when it is all over i give most of the entries to my wife who cooks them or turns them into coleslaw and so on the rest get given to neighbours
524925 there has been more interest in vegetable growing partly because food from supermarkets is getting more expensive and people want to grow their own there has been huge demand for allotments recently
524926 more people are coming along because it is a good british day out
524927 they like the humidity so we could well see some very big ones
524928 it is hard to beat the world record because they grow such enormous ones in the united states but we could certainly set a new uk record
524929 the only problem is the sheer size of these things we often see a forklift truck being used to move them about at the show although sometimes it is possible to get a tarpaulin underneath them and shuffle them along the ground
524930 no one is revealing too much about their vegetables yet because everyone is very competitive and you dont want to give anything away
524931 there has been just enough sunshine and things are looking good
524932 there are still four weeks to go so anything could happen between now and then
524933 a lot of these speakers are sort of here to empower others to show them that we can stop projects that are very unpopular
524934 this is a completely new type of dinosaur that was so far unknown
524935 nobody even expected that members of this group lived in that time so this gives us new knowledge about the whole evolution of the t rex group
524936 the one certainty is that confusion reigns at the heart of labours controversial eco town project
524937 local residents have been left in limbo as caroline flint performs u turn after u turn she must set out a clear timetable for the eco town project and end the uncertainty hanging over local communities
524938 we want to build more green homes and create the sustainable communities of tomorrow but with the support of local people labour has arrogantly ploughed ahead riding roughshod over the voice of local communities
524939 my information is that caroline flint is still wholly committed to the project
524940 we are incredibly disappointed about this these days if a case comes up within the bedfordshire forces area we know its going to be extremely difficult to get a conviction
524941 this case was significant and was taken seriously by police rspb and prosecutors
524942 however the loss of the ammunition from greyfriars police station means it is believed that there is no longer a realistic prospect of conviction
524943 all 29 had been shot with a bullet going in through the chest and out of the back i believe it was an organised attempt by adults not youths to eradicate these birds from the lake
524944 buying presents to impress women has been a key part of mating rituals in humans for some time but it appears that it is the act of generosity rather than the gift itself which is being used as a mating signal
524945 we have found in previous studies that women are attracted to generous men they seem to like heroic types for short term relationships but altruists for long term relationships
524946 generosity could be a way for men to show their suitability to invest in a relationship and help in rearing offspring
524947 across human societies very public acts of generosity such as philanthropy bystander intervention and heroism at war are primarily male activities
524948 choosing alternative species helps to ease the pressure on stocks of more traditional fish basa has had a meteoric rise our palate tends to appreciate fish that are not strong flavoured and basa is one those it has a texture and taste that is quite similar to a white sea fish
524949 people are becoming more adventurous partly in response to tv chefs happy to cook different types of fish and partly because retailers and processors are much more focused on sourcing fish responsibly
524950 cap may now have become a hazard to public health through out the eu and may be promoting inequalities in health through the types of food consumed
524951 this might controversially be described as a system designed to kill europeans through coronary heart disease our results suggest that changes in cap subsides would particularly benefit france italy spain and the uk
524952 perhaps the first study to quantify the impact of the cap subsidies for dairy and meat commodities on cardiovascular mortality
524953 it seems very probable that something that globally affects the type of food we eat could have very big repercussions on disease
524954 the price of venison now is good it is a popular meat because it is nutritious and free range and pretty fashionable promoted by celebrity chefs it has become very worthwhile for people to start poaching
524955 there is a definite correlation between the people doing the poaching and those committing other rural crimes like theft and fly tipping the romantic notion of the poacher has long gone there are nasty violent gangs
524956 the old days of one for the pot have long gone now we have organised violent gangs taking diesel livestock tiles and trailers theyre threatening farmers theyre the scum of the earth
524957 several of our major breeders and suppliers in the county were hit hard last season having a detrimental effect on the sport in our area
524958 numerous small breeders have lost birds in varying quantities from a few tens to several hundreds at a time
524959 combining the loss of the birds themselves with the feeders fencing sheds and even power tools that have been taken it is easy to see how the costs mount and whole businesses can be plunged into turmoil by this type of crime
524960 were dealing with the hardcore and no matter how many vehicles we seize or get people locked up they still keep at it the trend is definitely up
524961 you talk about dirty tricks brass knuckles steel knuckles cheap shots tripping people up i ve never seen anybody in the wrestling business that has more dirty tricks than she does
524962 its not necessarily james bond like spying where you have some super spy penetrating the deepest u s secrets
524963 its trying relentlessly to get defense related technology from u s companies u s engineers and the u s military
524964 theyre claiming that we built this house with money he earned illegally
524965 theres isnt a shred of truth in it not one dime
524966 he is totally unable to lie it is not his nature hes as honest and truthful and trusting as they come
524967 if i really wanted to i could retire but i enjoy what i do
524968 i feel very productive and believe i can be an asset to a community
524969 i have been a city manager for 30 years and im healthy and active and still have a lot to offer
524970 i have very much dedicated myself to keeping up with the trends and philosophies in city administration
524971 i think mr payne has strong attributes that will help out a lot of communities
524972 his willingness to be a team player is important and that will help out other communities
524973 i take continuous education seriously and maintain a high level of knowledge as a professional
524974 its a sellers market so anything of interest i will take
524975 i had a good job in waukesha i had been there for nine years and i was very happy but things were routine and just going along
524976 i wanted to go somewhere exciting and challenging and with rio rancho that was available
524977 the mayor leaving under a cloud and mike williams was interim mayor for six months so you couldnt plan on anything everything was unsettable
524978 everyone was upset and they didnt know what was going to happen next
524979 it was a pretty unsettling time for everybody my primary challenge was to settle things down i dont think people really understood how much it affected peoples jobs and lives
524980 you get a new boss and you just dont know what to do so you do your job the best you can and not take as many risks
524981 people draw back on themselves and they arent as innovative as they otherwise would be
524982 i look to other people i dont look at myself
524983 my job is facilitating others i put in the proceedings and the culture
524984 he helped keep us focused on projects such as hp hewlett packard cnm and unm he also began to help paint a vision on where and how government should operate in response to its citizens
524985 eighty percent of my job is dealing with everyday things
524986 how to pay for this how to do that and that is still going on we still have to finalize the contract with hp and in mid august the staff will have its first strategic planning session
524987 but we do not think the level will get much above 41 per cent
524988 you know hes new hes doesnt look like the other presidents on the currency you know hes got a hes got a funny name
524989 i dont think its accurate to say that my comments have nothing to do with race
524990 heres what i was saying and i think this should be undisputed that i dont come out of central casting when it comes to presidential races for a whole range of reasons im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama i am african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate what that means is that im sort of unfamiliar and people are still trying to get a fix on who i am where i come from what my values are and so forth in a way that might not be true if i seemed more familiar
524991 i was so happy to receive this product at my baby shower my best friend knew i was looking for something to help my problem i am doing much better now thank you for a product that is safe for pregnancy
524992 i have had a bad burning feeling when i use the bathroom it was very unpleasant and my doctor said i had to take antibiotics but i am not keen on them i tried this product and it has helped so much no more pain thank you very much for natural medicine
524993 rumore della glottide araba mentre ingoia la modernit non mentre la rigetta
524994 tu non avvicinerai tu non toccherai tu non proverai il piacere tu non parlerai tu non apparterrai al limite tu non esisterai se non nellombra e nel segreto rinuncia a te stesso sotto pena di essere soppresso non comparirai se non vuoi scomparire la tua esistenza sar mantenuta soltanto al prezzo del tuo annullamento
524995 le donne di questa citt seguono la moda delle musulmane parlano speditamente si avvolgono in mantelli e sono velate
524996 dont measure yourself by what you have accomplished but by what you should have accomplished with your ability
524997 i dont need any extra motivation my motivation is to win
524998 im very proud of my area around the plate i dont want anyone messing with my dirt
524999 its a yankee world were just falling apart in it
525000 i think it is too little too late for the yankees to make the playoffs
525001 its the sort of thing that usually happens to someone else
525002 i guess this is my first experience with a major home disaster like this
525003 i was wondering what the heck is that truck doing here then i walked around and saw the damage
525004 i kind of liked the last one to be honest with you
525005 we put all the pressure on him the game winning field goal and he made the kick
525006 matt has been doing that pretty consistently since hes been here
525007 so it didnt really surprise anybody but its nice to see him do that in his first live two minute drill
525008 it felt good to just show the team that i can do it and give them some confidence in me so in the game when i do have a chance to have a game winner
525009 i still have to do it in the game there will still be some questions but hopefully ill get the opportunity and do well in the game
525010 it isnt really my place to say this but i am technically mayor right now
525011 so i figure just have a good time dont break anything and just have fun dont cause trouble and just have a good day
525012 they were the strength during their last season of football and just great leaders
525013 these are a few screenshots for the upcoming rp server the lands of kaelthia
525014 you find a tax and he wants to raise it
525015 gayle phillips stopped in and picked up copies of the 3 water right files for the city of great falls around march 23 2006
525016 gayle called 5 31 2006 and asked about amending the flow rate of 1971 claim to the capacity of the diverision structure which would increase flow rate to 155 cfs
525017 gayle stopped by 6 27 2006 picked up copies of the reveiw abstracts discussed the claims and wondered about amending
525018 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
525019 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
525020 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
525021 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
525022 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
525023 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
525024 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
525025 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
525026 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
525027 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
525028 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
525029 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
525030 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
525031 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
525032 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
525033 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
525034 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
525035 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
525036 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
525037 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
525038 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
525039 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
525040 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
525041 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
525042 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
525043 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
525044 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
525045 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
525046 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
525047 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
525048 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
525049 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
525050 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
525051 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
525052 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
525053 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
525054 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
525055 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
525056 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
525057 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
525058 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
525059 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
525060 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
525061 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
525062 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
525063 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
525064 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
525065 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
525066 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
525067 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
525068 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
525069 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
525070 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
525071 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
525072 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
525073 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
525074 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
525075 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
525076 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
525077 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
525078 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
525079 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
525080 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
525081 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
525082 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

525086 theres nothing you can say except for there goes my barn all my hay everything
525087 were struggling right now to find hay its been so dry this summer that its hard to find for our animals
525088 while nothing can replace a personal experience in a national park we think our
525089 weve been in this business 10 years and weve only now turned a profit
525090 the last thing we want to do is have a very large business thats not profitable and drags our margins down
525091 sap thought customers would go to a web site configure it themselves and found the first hundred or so implementations required a lot of time and a lot of tremendous costs
525092 small businesses are calling for support calling sap because they dont have it departments sap is spending a lot of resources to configure and troubleshoot the problem

525094 sends a horrible message that verizon seeks to partner with racists
525095 dont plan on working back in iraq there wont be a position here and there wont be a position in houston
525096 i was upset i was curled up in a ball on the bed i just could not believe what had happened
525097 and told them of the urgency of rescuing an american citizen
525098 several attackers who first drugged her then repeatedly raped and injured her both physically and emotionally
525099 the way the law presently stands i would say that they dont have at least in the criminal system the opportunity for justice
525100 there are several i think their excuses why the perpetrators havent been prosecuted
525101 but i think it is the responsibility of our government the justice department and the state department when crimes occur against american citizens overseas in iraq contractors that are paid by the american public that we pursue the criminal cases as best as we possibly can and that people are prosecuted
525102 air things out in a public forum of a courtroom
525103 i think that men who are there believe that they live without laws
525104 the last thing she should have expected was for her own people to turn on her
525105 because they were assuming sole responsibility for the criminal investigations
525106 the safety and security of all employees remains kbrs top priority
525107 i want other women to know that its not their fault
525108 they can go against corporations that have treated them this way
525109 there needs to be a voice out there that really pushed for change
525110 because then all of a sudden if youve done exactly what youve been instructed not to do tell somebody then youre in danger
525111 its very easy for bad things to happen down there and not have it be even slightly suspicious
525112 the company takes ms leamons allegations very seriously and has and will continue to cooperate with the proper law enforcement authorities in the investigation of her allegations to the extent possible
525113 afforded with counseling and referral services through the companys employee assistance program
525114 therefore the company requests that you fully investigate all the facts alleged by ms leamon as the company intends to pursue all available remedies should false statements be publicized
525115 not in a position to release any personnel or investigative records regarding ms leamons allegations at this time
525116 allegations are currently under investigation by the appropriate law enforcement authorities therefore kbr cannot comment on the specifics of the allegations or investigation
525117 any allegation of sexual harassment or assault is taken seriously and investigated thoroughly
525118 he was one of the people involved in saying dont say anything
525119 he told me not to speak of this to anyone and that he would take care of it
525120 one is in the camp managers office one is in the operations office and one is in a hallway
525121 we had worked other situations together in the past and i talked to her and she was like i dont know if id report that you know what happens when you report things and i did id seen it
525122 the doctor took me into her office and we talked a long time before she did an exam
525123 we talked about the assault and the details and she was actually very very kind and encouraged me to report it to the military she tried convincing me that it wasnt my fault for having a drink she was just a really kind lady and that was the first time i had given any of the whole details of all that had happened
525124 its one big battle over where to fight the battle
525125 we have a complete process in place for solving military criminal violations when soldiers commit crimes but for the 180 000 employees of private contractors over there there is nothing
525126 its like texas west of the pecos in 1890 over there
525127 think about it you have 180 000 people over there youre going to have a few crimes i dont know how anybody could fairly view this as a partisan issue crimes happen when you bring people together anywhere and in a war setting without adult supervision crimes are going to increase that is just a fact and if you eliminate law enforcement the crimes are going to get worse because people will quickly learn they can get away with it
525128 where every day in the houston chronicle there was a story exposing what egregious things go unchecked in the corporate culture the united states got to peek into the corporate underwear drawer and saw it was not as pretty as it looked from the outside
525129 part of the reason im going forward with this case is to change the system
525130 who knows how many of us rape victims are out there
525131 i dont think ive been able to make any decisions or plans or goals yet
525132 human resources made me sign statements saying that im supposed to be back in dubai on april 7 at 10 p m and if im not there i will not be reimbursed my 1 600 airfare or for my two weeks vacation
525133 yes my license is in good standing and ive never had a problem
525134 but it means a difference of about 6 000 a month in salary and no health insurance my biggest reason for working for kbr in the first place was so i could get insurance for my husband and girls
525135 ive been trying to figure out how im going to go back to work how am i going to make myself do this
525136 someone from kbr employee assistance gave me a flier to call someone in houston
525137 im 9 000 miles away in iraq and the website says please put in your zip code and well refer you to a rape crisis counselor in your zip code area
525138 i was assaulted by somebody who was wearing the same uniform as him and i just didnt want him to think bad of me my children are pretty much my world
525139 i didnt want him to be upset because i was calling out somebody who was wearing his same uniform theyre supposed to be proud of what they do and im proud of my sons and in my mind i live that war every day i can make all sorts of excuses under the sun for bad behavior
525140 american women working in iraq and afghanistan continue to be sexually assaulted while their assailants go free
525141 they would tell me to stay quiet about it or try to make it seem as if i brought it on myself or lied about it
525142 we do have active investigations somewhere about somewhere upwards of somewhere between four and six i believe is the number
525143 this might be something you want to require and include in your contracts before you award them
525144 at this time the house armed services committee is looking into private johnsons case but no decisions have been made for a formal investigation
525145 lavenas father john johnson has discovered far more stories that have matched his daughters than he ever wanted to know ten other families of suicide female soldiers have contacted him the common thread among them rape

525147 moving on from this weeks flap with the obama campaign over
525148 a celebrity with a tv ad a week capped with a campaign
525149 the hardest thing to do in politics is campaign as someone you arent todd writes
525150 and yet many a candidate tries to run as something they arent simply because the strategy dictates it
525151 are we seeing this happen right now to john mccain
525152 if you were to diagnose the best way to go at obama in the midst of this disastrous republican environment you might come up with the tactics the mccain brain trust unveiled this week paint obama as a bit full of himself over confident elitest and out of touch todd writes
525153 there are a number of ways to paint that picture including attacking obama for his celebrity america has a love hate relationship with celebrity

525170 love is patient love is kind it does not envy it does not boast it is not proud it is not rude it is not self seeking it is not easily angered it keeps no record of wrongs love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth it always protects always trust always hopes always perseveres
525171 you dont understand i am totally different from this person im in love with
525172 its better to spend a hour with my parents then an hour cleaning something that will be dirty in 5 hours
525173 im proud that ive won on every tour basically i havent won a world golf championship so it would mean a lot and obviously give me a massive amount of confidence going into the next week
525174 a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference
525175 i didnt really address it until i missed it big on 11 and 13 because i had been playing so well and i felt like it was only a couple of yards off the fairway most of the time
525176 sometimes it doesnt go your way sometimes somebody else plays a little bit better
525177 i expect at least one and probably two or three us to have good rounds in the 60s tomorrow and force the guys behind us to catch up with birdies
525178 if it wasnt for the locals in new orleans not the government i dont know what we would have done
525179 its definitely going to help us out a little bit extending our wallet
525180 we are more careful about the things we buy now we price things and i look at bargains and sale papers and then we come out and shop
525181 i cant see hurrying through something that still needs tweaking and then we have to come back in a couple of months and do addendums or amendments or repeal the ordinance because it was not serving the purpose and the need it was intended to
525182 whos going to say what is an offensive odor it wont be very long and well have federal air quality guidelines coming
525183 thats just not a job that the county level needs to get into
525184 the dairies have very strong environmental laws they have to follow so in my opinion why does the county need to set something
525185 i think we as the county we have a responsibility to serve the tax payers and there has to be some happy medium that everybody can live with and we can also improve the community and keep it healthy and safe for the residents
525186 its not that were trying to dodge it but there was no way that for me i was going to be in favor of it the way its written now
525187 i think that as you read the ordinance youll find a pile of manure could be a violation it could be a problem if you had a neighbor that got mad at you and wanted to take the thing to its fullest
525188 i think the things just too loosely written its just way too broad there are large agricultural establishments out there that would be prime targets

525191 the festival in charleston encompasses theater dance and music as well as visual arts
525192 therefore we have included a jewelry maker a writer a steel drummer and a singer in our reception and weekend showing we had no idea what we would find
525193 when we began our search for artists for the first moja exhibit we had no idea what we would find
525194 we found artists with wide ranging styles and subject matter from the more traditional to some more primitive and some very edgy since the theme of the festival is community we wanted to choose a show that encompasses as much of the work as possible and present a cohesive show
525195 i feel theres never been this venue for us to get together and show our works
525196 african american artists have always been here but unfortunately many people have been unaware of our presence
525197 i do see this universal sense or presence in all our work
525198 the hiv travel and immigration ban performs no public service really is unnecessary and ineffective
525199 we thank our allies on the hill who fought to end this injustice and now call on secretary of health and human services leavitt to remove the remaining regulatory barriers to hiv positive visitors and immigrants
525200 i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
525201 the proposed rules would curtail abusive credit card practices the same practices that along with predatory lending in the housing market have contributed to so many folks being in financial hell right now
525202 being poor means that you dont have the resources available to you to improve your financial situation
525203 being broke means that you do have resources available to you to help improve your financial situation

525215 the players get a huge lift when there is a capacity crowd for our home games

525223 i came to vote because i wanted to see some changes in latvia
525224 i doubt the referendum will bring enough votes because it requires too many but we have hope
525225 peoples huge activity in the summers hottest day showed their unequivocal attitude the politics of the ruling parties is bankrupt and the president has an opportunity to fulfill his promise and become the peoples president
525226 create a deep crisis in latvia and therefore i shall not participate in the referendum and so shall ask also other people these amendments are judicially questionable and are undemocratic
525227 these constitutional amendments could create a huge crisis and the situation might be created when there is neither elected parliament nor president in latvia

525299 when it comes to angels you do not want to attract their attention
525300 when all is said and done angels are in all actuality spiritual parasites these things feed on mental emotional and spiritual energy and as they feed on their chosen host the host slowly becomes weaker in all areas the hosts will heart and soul deteriorate to the point that the physical body begins to show the signs of that deterioration
525301 the name seraphim clearly indicates their ceaseless and eternal revolution about divine principles their heat and keenness the exuberance of their intense perpetual tireless activity and their elevative and energetic assimilation of those below kindling them and firing them to their own heat and wholly purifying them by a burning and all consuming flame and by the unhidden unquenchable changeless radiant and enlightening power dispelling and destroying the shadows of darkness
525302 the name seraphim does not come from charity only but from the excess of charity expressed by the word ardor or fire hence dionysius expounds the name seraphim according to the properties of fire containing an excess of heat now in fire we may consider three things
525303 first the movement which is upwards and continuous this signifies that they are borne inflexibly towards god
525304 secondly the active force which is heat which is not found in fire simply but exists with a certain sharpness as being of most penetrating action and reaching even to the smallest things and as it were with superabundant fervor whereby is signified the action of these angels exercised powerfully upon those who are subject to them rousing them to a like fervor and cleansing them wholly by their heat
525305 thirdly we consider in fire the quality of clarity or brightness which signifies that these angels have in themselves an inextinguishable light and that they also perfectly enlighten others
525306 impatient of any second place let us emulate dignity and glory and if we will it we shall be inferior to them in nothing
525307 in the light of intelligence meditating upon the creator in his work and the work in its creator we shall be resplendent with the light of the cherubim if we burn with love for the creator only his consuming fire will quickly transform us into the flaming likeness of the seraphim
525308 the name of the holy virtues signifies a certain powerful and unshakable virility welling forth into all their godlike energies not being weak and feeble for any reception of the divine illuminations granted to it mounting upwards in fullness of power to an assimilation with god never falling away from the divine life through its own weakness but ascending unwaveringly to the superessential virtue which is the source of virtue fashioning itself as far as it may in virtue perfectly turned towards the source of virtue and flowing forth providentially to those below it abundantly filling them with virtue

525310 we have one wish it is to make the beijing olympic games a global sports gathering a success
525311 the beijing olympic games belongs to the chinese people and more importantly to people across the world
525312 i dont think that politicizing the games will do anything to advance the issues it goes against the shared aspirations of people from around the world
525313 focus more on the environment and controlling pollution we want to pay more attention to improving peoples lives
525314 how could i have children so vastly different from the same set of parents

525324 as urbahns skull showed no sign of a fracture its unlikely he was knocked out before he was stabbed and the sprawled position in which his skeleton was found suggests his hands were not tied behind his back
525325 its the killer in front who gets covered with urbahns blood a killer who does not leave blood in the subaru because he leaves the scene in another car
525326 this left an unbloodied tamihere to drive heidi to tararu creek rd where he subsequently raped and killed her
525327 things went well until murray briefly left the room and i unexpectedly found myself alone with tamihere suddenly the warm smile wilted on his lips his eyes narrowed and he stared coldly at me it was as if a switch had tripped inside his head turning off the nice david and flicking on the nasty one he sat in silence staring at me until murray came back then the switch flicked back again and the good david was suddenly back i have often wondered if in those few moments tamihere dropped his guard and showed me the man who might have murdered the swedes
525328 he was a total loner it was his nature and his preference

525332 prudent debt financing is one tool we can use to get on with the job now to build infrastructure that will endure for decades
525333 national has confirmed they would borrow to cover the massive hole they will create in the public accounts if elected unless they are prepared to slash public services once again
525334 the national partys proposed economic programme for new zealand can be summed up in four words more borrowing from foreigners
525335 bill englishs attempt to justify his borrow and hope fiscal management by promising to borrow only for infrastructure is an insult to the intelligence of new zealanders

525350 chinas recent behaviour is a humiliation for the international olympic committee
525351 given their utter failure to deliver on their human rights promises it is simply untenable for any representative of the united kingdom to give political endorsement to these games
525352 i therefore urge you not to attend the closing ceremony of the beijing games or indeed any other ceremonies associated with them
525353 i dont think the police will find her killer now its too late for that theres no new evidence no new witnesses after eight years
525354 we are considering the ramifications of the jurys verdict before we do anything else
525355 it can be difficult with cold case reviews because the whos wheres and whens in the witness statements arent going to change
525356 if you havent got any new forensics it can be tricky to find new leads
525357 i dont want to spend any more time in any of her majestys holiday camps

525362 we have been fighting for many years and now we need to get back together as a family we hope that the police will look again into the murder of jill dando
525363 i am overwhelmed i want to thank my family my legal team my medical team and all the people who have supported me at belmarsh whitemoor and manchester prisons and all my supporters across the uk
525364 throughout the trial he did not dare to get his hopes up and continually said to me in the dock he believed he would be convicted
525365 his eyes filled with tears and he took a very deep breath
525366 i would be surprised if there was not a claim for compensation for the eight years of suffering plans are already afoot
525367 we are disappointed by todays verdict but especially disappointed for jills family and friends however we respect the decision of the court the investigation into her murder was complex thorough and professional with more than 2 500 statements taken and 3 700 exhibits recovered we would like to thank the members of public who came forward following the murder to give us information in particular those that gave evidence in court
525368 will be reflecting on todays verdict and considering how best to proceed
525369 we can confirm that nia witts has been found safe and well in belgium
525370 arrangements have been made to repatriate and reunite her with her family
525371 i am pleased i have been concerned for the family so this is excellent news
525372 it must have been such a worry for the family especially as she is only 15
525373 she is a keen sportsgirl its such a pity this has happened but great news shes been found
525374 its the worst thing that can happen to a parent to have a child go missing
525375 we are so very concerned for nias welfare we and her brothers love nia very much
525376 we want nia to know that she is not in any trouble we are just desperate for news about her
525377 i have known nia since she was in primary school she is a great girl really lovely

525415 this is from the vendors its a love offering for you guys we know youve had a tough time lately
525416 sir weve received a report that you are selling books on the street
525417 i know they shouldnt be here im waiting to load them in my trailer
525418 im waiting for my van so i can get it out
525419 its inside too the mechanic says it is almost done
525420 i dont want to have the books here im waiting for my van to be finished so i can get the trailer and get these books out of here
525421 ill go see when the van will be fixed but i cant leave this stuff here alone can you watch it while i go in to the dealership to get my wife i was trying to get on the computer and talk to the mechanic
525422 i cant watch your stuff it shouldnt even be here
525423 well if youre going to write me a ticket that means youll have to be here to get the information right
525424 its not them its not us it is god who is good
525425 i failed to ask her if anyone else has ever paid a 3000 repair bill with hundreds fifties and twenties i wish i would have
525426 in deciding what i believe on these matters i have weighed up the balance between the right to life the most important civil liberty the fact that there is no such thing as complete security and the importance of our hard won civil liberties
525427 therefore on a matter of principle i cannot support the proposal in the bill for pre charge detention of 42 days
525428 our legislation covering the security service refers to the protection of parliamentary democracy i have a plea handling national security should as far as possible be above party politics as it has been for most of my career
525429 the lack of adequate hostel provision and the shocking increase in waiting lists for social housing reflect the failure of the state to understand this complex problem it is alarming that the most vulnerable women are faced with the unenviable choice of squatting sleeping rough or relying on family or friends for accommodation a big part of this problem stems from labours failure to build enough housing in every category over the last decade
525430 this report underestimates the true numbers because it only includes those accepted by councils as a priority many vulnerable women escaping domestic violence lie low and stay away from councils altogether so are not counted those who ask for help are not always accepted as a priority and dont make any lists this is a largely hidden problem which these numbers only touch upon
525431 councils have to take more responsibility for these vulnerable people yes we need more houses but the government has to be more creative with the private sector if we are ever going to meet housing needs
525432 it has been virtually impossible for councils to build new homes because they cant borrow money on the open market
525433 last year was the first time since 1983 that we built more social houses than were lost through right to buy our recent housing bill and the creation of the homes and communities agency will help to deliver council homes more quickly and will make it easier for councils to build their own social housing to meet the needs
525434 t hese approaches have yet to completely account for the idiosyncracies of qh
525435 every scroll does not necessarily reflect the communitys particular use of language
525436 i t must be assumed that the language of the community evolved over that period
525437 i t is clear that the qumran community had a highly loaded ideology of language which inevitably shaped their linguistic choices
525438 betray a strong sectarian impulse as well as a perceived conflict with the establishment
525439 none of the aramaic scrolls appears to have been composed by the qumran sectarians
525440 w e find both similarity and distinction between qumran and mishnaic hebrew the similarity is most profound in the area of syntax while the distinction is most significant in lexicon
525441 envisioned themselves as the true heirs of the biblical tradition
525442 t heir use of such linguistic anomalies seems like an attempt to reconstruct preclassical forms
525443 t he community believed that it alone knew the truth this symbolic terminology ultimately becomes a language for the community alone which in itself highlights the communitys isolation
525444 t he attempt at rapprochement in mmt would not have been conducive to the use of an antilanguage
525445 we have not exactly covered ourselves in glory with some pretty unedifying behaviour by senior members of the party
525446 breath of fresh air after the stale self indulgent solipsism from warwick
525447 he probably felt he needed to set himself up as the heir apparent
525448 and whatever has happened this week it has worked now everyone is talking about david miliband as the heir apparent
525449 he would mark a return to the old blair policies that is not going to be helpful in a general election campaign we need to find a unity candidate
525450 hes a brilliant guy but he is not achieving everything he should have done
525451 are they serious about carrying all of this stuff on or is there a bottom line we are in a game of brinkmanship they cannot get rid of him brown so the worst case scenario is they plunge us even deeper into civil war
525452 theres this wonderful actor called leonard rossiter but i dont think hell ever become a star hes too real

525454 do you have a late slot after the duchess of malfi

525458 jessica did not knowingly or intentionally take any banned substances
525459 jessica is heartbroken at this turn of events as making the u s olympic team was her cherished dream and proudest moment
525460 she intends to resume her swimming career as soon as possible and to again fulfill her olympic dream in 2012
525461 their faith in her was justified and she will soon give them more reason to be proud of her and her accomplishments
525462 im proud that ive won on every tour basically i havent won a world golf championship so it would mean a lot and obviously give me a massive amount of confidence going into the next week
525463 a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference
525464 i didnt really address it until i missed it big on 11 and 13 because i had been playing so well and i felt like it was only a couple of yards off the fairway most of the time
525465 sometimes it doesnt go your way sometimes somebody else plays a little bit better
525466 i expect at least one and probably two or three us to have good rounds in the 60s tomorrow and force the guys behind us to catch up with birdies
525467 they started midway through my career so i havent given them the priority like i do a major or care about like a major
525468 but they are always the best fields in the game theyre always on great golf courses theyre always on tough tests so i think theres a lot of merit to whoever wins those
525469 im proud that ive won on every tour basically i havent won a world golf championship so it would mean a lot and obviously give me a massive amount of confidence going into the next week
525470 a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference
525471 thick the rest was up to me the tail is wide and the rails hard it makes caching waves ultra easy and the board loose the rest of the rails are 25 on the bottom with 75 on the top near the nose is 50 50 i ran around 4
525472 i cannot give you a date but it will be as soon as possible
525473 i would rather receive the new indictment and have sufficient time to study it and then have my initial appearance for that and enter my plea
525474 of course its a waste of time and they should have amended the indictment before
525475 we have been struggling with cut price competition from abroad for years
525476 we dont belong to any consortium and our prices are the same as they have been since 2003 21 a day which is good value for beautiful sand and clean water
525477 after the games if they have done well and they get back together as a couple they can add another half a million dollars a piece to their value over the next 12 months
525478 that would be the kind of story which would generate a lot of magazine deals and television coverage they could also exploit their advertising potential as a couple as well as doing separate deals as individuals
525479 if i were managing either of them id be hiring a matchmaker pretty quickly
525480 should they do well in the pool individually they would be worth 200 000 250 000 a year over the next four years
525481 i definitely understand who i am the last six or seven years and all the hardships ive had to get past have cemented me
525482 i wont take the attention too far and get cocky about myself i still think im an underdog
525483 he could get about a year if you take the consuming and possessing charges and run them concurrently
525484 i know from my experience with many past cases that trafficking charges can get reduced to possessing it happens all the time
525485 if they go on with all the charges then in singapore law at least two sentences must run consecutively
525486 depression and the type of work you do can drive you to take drugs he can say he is not the normal type of person who just goes on for the fun of it but he got addicted because of all the emotional trauma that he was going through
525487 but whatever you say you are faced with the minimum sentence and that you cannot escape
525488 he will get the same sentence any singaporean would have got
525489 i dont think theres a policy that if you are a foreigner you get a harsh sentence
525490 as it is the drug laws the mandatory sentencing is really harsh and then to treat someone from outside singapore with a harsher sentence i think it will be very very unfair
525491 musimy broni naszych narodowych interes w tak e w dziedzinie bezpiecze stwa
525492 no comment on anything related to the vice presidential issue
525493 you have to decide either be trampled under hamas shoes or stand in dignity
525494 we have to stop rallies and marches or anything that leads to mass gatherings
525495 what they say hamas is doing in gaza they are doing here
525496 untuk pertama ini yang ikut para guru namun bila ada siswa atau remaja yang ingin bergabung dipersilakan
525497 acara yang dipusatkan di depan ruko star mart dan kawasan hom pimpa ini dijamin akan mebyemarakkan hari minggu penghuni lippo cikarang
525498 kami tidak bisa menerima kejadian seperti ini masak seorang ibu tega teganya mencabuli anak sendiri semestinya dia memberi bimbingan yang positif atau mencegah agar perbuatan terkutuk yang mengotori desa ini dicegah bukannya dia menikmatinya
525499 it was really a heartbreaking decision on the part of the executive board
525500 they did everything they could to hold the tournament despite all the damage but we just couldnt pull it off
525501 there were so many factors and the board looked at every option because we wanted the economic stimulus the tournament brings to help the area recover a little after the storm but it just wasnt ultimately possible
525502 this year was supposed to be the 70th annual event
525503 but next year it will in fact be 70 years since the inception of the tournament
525504 yeah were hanging out its so much fun like omg hhaahha
525505 we had an awesome dodge charger back in june here at pocono
525506 i hope that we can run well again this weekend its going to be a real battle to make it in the chase these next six races so its real important to run consistent and stay up front
525507 thats the main goal thats what all the teams want to do for their sponsors and owners and the employees that work on these cars
525508 out of the 14 drivers going for the chase i think that we have as good a shot as anyone from sixth on back
525509 we have some different people in place at gillett evernham motorsports and we have a better starting point this year
525510 i think we have a great test team that does a lot for our team now i feel that everything that they work on is much better than last year
525511 the patch in turn three doesnt have as much grip as it did when we were here before
525512 its easy to slip off the top of it and get too high now which it looks like a lot of people figured out because there are a lot of marks above the patch
525513 its the same racetrack just a little bit slower and a little bit later in the year those are the things that you have to get right again on sunday to win the race
525514 last week was unfortunate but thats what it was and im sure that it wont happen again
525515 i think that we had a really good tire that goodyear brought here for the first race its the same one that we have again this weekend
525516 i look forward to being able to have some green flag stops its a good strong durable racy tire and im looking forward to that
525517 0 the current amount of gold you have earned on the quest
525518 except this time i want them to show people what i hacked is all about
525519 it would be better if they if they were never born or that a mill stone were tied about their necks and cast into the sea
525520 although ive had a relatively glitch free experience lots of other users around the country have complained of frequent at amp t network outages dropped calls and sometimes slower than molasses connectivity
525521 german tech mag area dvd have published a test of the iphone 3g they said their device serial production not part of a seeding had serious trouble maintaining a stable signal even 300 meters unobstructed view from the celltowers 500 meters from the celltower within a building they could hardly get any 3g signal at the same time their nokia e61i worked fine with full bars reception
525522 apple iphone 3g when you are outside and next to a cell tower but even then dont expect full 3g
525523 we understand that some users are reporting 3g reception issues and we are looking into this
525524 why isnt this working for me yet when will it happen how can i make it happen faster when will i see results
525525 you cant hurry love no you just have to wait you got to trust give it time no matter how long it takes
525526 i dealt with other peoples problems with every step and foreclosure indiana i had to remember that they werent there because they
525527 indeed he is he keeps staring at the underage girls on the bus
525528 hmm maybe we should just do the world a favor and kill him now before he has the chance to actually molest strangle molest and strangle somebody
525529 thats not a bad idea preventative murdering i like it itd be just like minority report except instead of being psychic and sitting in tubs in white goo were just judgemental and prejudice
525530 the base headline for me is that this will be the first 100 high definition tv big event of any kind after seeing the beijing olympics it will be hard to look at many things but particularly sporting events in anything other than hd
525531 we have to respond in covering the olympics to what consumers are demanding in general
525532 we are trying to provide expanding and wonderful coverage but it is also about allowing the user to control the schedule
525533 nbc has been successful in broadening the distribution using all its cable channels but now you will be able to watch olympics highlights in your office in your bathroom on the corner of broadway and 42nd street in new york it has created more places too for sponsors to let you see their products which is how you get the olympics for free
525534 before 1968 no one remembers much about the olympics on tv
525535 but in 1968 both in grenoble and mexico city abc decided to make it a show
525536 there was not a lot of technological wizardry but with all the cameras and all the data abc made the olympics a tv event a vision that continues to today
525537 it is really a case of the chinese government wanting everything to be first class and state of the art and i think that is wise
525538 in the marathon and so far behind we werent covering them it may not be there
525539 but if they were in a badminton match or a race around the track or anything we would have covered like that you can see the kid from your hometown any time you want
525540 in the 1980s the olympics coverage started using chyrons the superimposed title graphics and you might have said so what at the time but now it is what is expected in all sports financial and news coverage
525541 i can see how this time all the hd and the video on the internet might force everyone from now on to do that on all programming
525542 the lambeth conference is required to do something rather than live down to the worst expectations of the bishops who stayed away we need to negotiate a separation in the communion sooner rather than later to leave the strongest possibility of remaining in some kind of fellowship the most unhealthy thing would be to allow the debate to continue for a long time we would have only ourselves to blame if more of the provinces go their own way
525543 the vast majority want to take steps towards restoring communion but a smaller group base the language of communion on feelings what it means to me what can i get from it
525544 a major question is how we move towards that point the highest degree of fellowship whilst allowing for an orderly separation
525545 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
525546 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
525547 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and off shore drilling
525548 we hope barack obama will realize that his ongoing opposition to john mccains realistic energy solutions and additional off shore drilling is wrong
525549 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
525550 i am the original hilton heiress im older wiser smarter and im damn wider
525551 my mom is zsa zsa gabor couple of you are going to know who that is my father was conrad hilton some of you have our towels keep em keep anything you steal keep em
525552 my mother and i were the best of friends now that were the same age
525553 she is in her own way a fighter to have survived with her own identity she tried to have her own normal life and become her own normal person to me thats a bit of an accomplishment when you come from that background
525554 the big key here is a lack of love on both parents part
525555 that is the key to everything in my view its a dark comedy and francesca is the first one to recognize this i cant begin to chart the calamities but i have to say even though francesca has experienced the depths of despair like many people do she has an amazing capacity to see the absurdity of it all and see the humor in that absurdity and that is why she is still around to tell the story
525556 theyd always ask your name so they could scream at you if it didnt work out
525557 he was wonderful but he was married to his business wed spend christmas together wed occasionally have lunches at lescoffier the ritzy restaurant that for years graced the penthouse level of the beverly hilton with my mom he loved my mom he couldnt pronounce zsa zsa so he called her georgia from time to time thats the truth
525558 if you sue and you lose you lose one hundred thousand dollars out of 200 million thats why i sued
525559 you cant live in the past that was his decision

525563 we believe in god and his word as spoken through the scriptures we believe that jesus christ is the way the truth and the life
525564 we believe in god and his word as spoken through the scriptures we believe that jesus christ is the way the truth and the life
525565 hey i am going to take a cruise on the titanic at least it is a ship
525566 let me be clear no way do i think john mccains campaign was being racist i think they are cynical
525567 i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
525568 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
525569 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing
525570 what that means is were going to have to try to get things done
525571 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama for his continued opposition to john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling gas tax relief and affordable nuclear energy
525572 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
525573 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
525574 i dont come out of central casting when it comes to presidential races for a whole range of reasons
525575 im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama im african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia i dont have the typical biography of a presidential candidate
525576 youve got statistics that say weve lost another 50 000 jobs that florida is in a recession for the first time in a decade and a half and what was being talked about was paris and britney
525577 theyre clever on creating distractions from the issues that really matter in peoples lives
525578 weve got to make sure we keep focused on peoples day to day concerns we dont take the skill of the republicans in engaging in negative campaigning lightly
525579 at some point people are going to have to make decisions are we going to keep arguing or are we going to get things done
525580 what i dont want to do is for the best to be the enemy of the good
525581 and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things that i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of actual energy independence then thats something im open to
525582 if he rode past on his bike if he saw me working in the garden he would stop and say hi
525583 scott told me that a lot of teenagers go down there but i didnt know anything about that
525584 i was trying to act as calm as i could
525585 i didnt want to try to run away who knows what he would have done if i did
525586 they wanted me to describe what this guy looked like
525587 up until wednesday night he seemed like a normal nice guy
525588 my friend had to work otherwise we would have still been there
525589 la crisi del terzo anno del terzo mese del terzo giorno
525590 il sentimento passa la passione si estingue rimane il reciproco rispetto
525591 sometimes you feel like its going to become a situation where they stop and take a picture look at that endangered species a native new yorker with a briefcase going to work
525592 i have dealt my whole life with fires but i have never seen a sight like this
525593 under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again and is going to help grow the economy right here in brevard county
525594 if we come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise where i have to accept some things that i dont like in order to get energy independence
525595 seria uma surpresa positiva n o ver ningu m armado na mar

525598 hai langit aku lebih baik dari kamu karena allah s w t telah menghiaskan aku dengan berbagai bagai negara dan bangsa beberapa laut sungai sungai tanam tanaman beberapa gunung dan lain lain
525599 hai bumi aku juga lebih elok dari kamu karena matahari bulan bintang bintang beberapa falah buruj arasy kursi dan syurga ada padaku
525600 hai langit ditempatku ada rumah yang dikunjungi dan untuk bertawaf para nabi para utusan dan arwah para wali dan solihin orang orang yang baik
525601 hai langit sesungguhnya pemimpin para nabi dan utusan bahkan sebagai penutup para nabi dan kekasih allah seru sekalian alam seutama utamanya segala yang wujud serta kepadanya penghormatan yang paling sempurna itu tinggal di tempatku dan dia menjalankan syariatnya juga di tempatku
525602 ya allah engkau telah mengabulkan permintaan orang yang tertimpa bahaya apabila mereka berdoa kepada engkau aku tidak dapat menjawab soalan bumi oleh itu aku minta kepada mu ya allah supaya muhammad engkau dinaikkan kepadaku langit sehingga aku menjadi mulia dengan kebagusannya dan berbangga
525603 janganlah engkau jibrail bertasbih pada malam ini dan engkau izrail jangan engkau mencabut nyawa pada malam ini
525604 tidak wahai jibrail tetapi pergilah engkau ke syurga dan ambillah buraq dan terus pergi kepada muhammad dengan buraq itu
525605 ya jibrail sesungguhnya aku telah mendengar nama muhammad sejak 40 tahun maka pemilik nama itu telah tertanam dalam hatiku dan aku sesudah itu menjadi rindu kepadanya sehingga aku tidak mau makan dan minum lagi aku laksana dibakar oleh api kerinduan
525606 aku akan mempertemukan engkau kepada orang yang engkau rindukan itu
525607 by making the time now for some financial planning and careful budgeting cash strapped students should be able to enjoy further education without worrying unduly about making ends meet
525608 not a week in we can do a lot better getting the ball down field
525609 he doesnt say a whole lot that way but i like his presence in the huddle
525610 he seems kind of relaxed out there itll be interesting to see him when the game is on i know this guy has played in bigger crowds than well play in front of
525611 when i came in i wanted things to be perfect i wanted to throw all touchdowns and no interceptions but it doesnt always work that way
525612 born in ukraine or some other eastern european country raised in england
525613 i cant believe i just missed my train because i was too busy thinking about movies and childrens cartoon shows i need to start writing this shit down
525614 way basically this is designed to hopefully keep my head clear enough so i dont accidentally walk into oncoming traffic because i was too busy thinking about how so much of
525615 to abandon withdraw from or cause to be abandoned or destroyed
525616 oh shit my insert name of light object floated away again last night i really need to start tying that thing down
525617 whether theyre a christian band or a satanic band we want to play with those bands
525618 duh brett i could have told you that without all this correlation between real world events and literature crap
525619 you dont love someone for their looks or their clothes or for their fancy car but because they sing a song only you can hear
525620 you blame your parents for the way you feel you may not believe me but i do here that quite
525621 i blame them for having sex i wouldnt be here if he could of kept it in his trousers
525622 oh really so what do you think im thinking greg saying as you know me so well
525623 im not saying i know what you think what i meant by it is well in my profession
525624 i hear it a lot and most of the time its just words they could be angry at other people yes but that doesnt mean they hate them so much that they want them to die
525625 and i think thats about it for today see you next wednesday greg
525626 weve still got 8 minutes i want to talk about what you just said
525627 are you ok we heard you scream in your sleep
525628 a better understanding of the protective components in breast milk is important for strategically improving maternal nutrition
525629 the protective role of breastfeeding against severe respiratory infections in healthy term infants is well established
525630 you have to decide either be trampled under hamas shoes or stand in dignity
525631 we are sending a message that no one is above the law and that no family is above the law
525632 we have to stop rallies and marches or anything that leads to mass gatherings
525633 we would not house someone who has finished the military commissions process back with the general detainee population they would be held separate from the other detainees
525634 whats the purpose here mr hamdan is going to be held until the government wants to release him
525635 women want to learn a little bit about football so when their husband is talking about what a linebacker is or a screen pass and the shotgun all of those funky words shell know what were talking about
525636 were going to talk about terminology and positions so they know where the quarterback is and what a wide receiver is and a tight end and things of that nature so that they dont think a tight end is just somebodys back side
525637 i think its a great idea because its going to help me understand more about what im looking at
525638 its going to be nice to know in detail what ive been looking at all these years
525639 were going to have some of our players do some drills with the ladies
525640 a lot of ladies get knowledge of football from their husbands and sometimes their husbands dont know as much as they think they do
525641 at first i thought it was going in there and teaching them everything and i thought gosh were going to be in there forever
525642 and then i said well lets do something for the ladies
525643 it says it wants to stop it but it earns lots of money from all the taxes farmers pay
525644 when people are chewing qat they dont ask awkward questions about where yemens oil revenues are going
525645 qat is the key to peace in yemen nobody would be stupid enough to meddle with that
525646 it says it wants to stop it but it earns lots of money from all the taxes farmers pay
525647 when people are chewing qat they dont ask awkward questions about where yemens oil revenues are going
525648 qat is the key to peace in yemen nobody would be stupid enough to meddle with that
525649 information of course is preliminary but it does appear he did not comply with the request the electronic control device was deployed that didnt work and they had to escalate to a higher level of force
525650 while there may be a small adoption fee most cats at shelters are already vaccinated and spayed or neutered
525651 additionally the cost of litter nutritious food and an occasional toy is relatively low and cats are comparatively inexpensive
525652 we are committed to saving lives and educating the public on responsible cat care
525653 our main goal is to find loving homes for animals that need one
525654 we need to stick with the mission but rethink some of the ways we implement it
525655 nasa has already completed a comprehensive look at possible systems
525656 nasa thinks it would be counterproductive to do that all over again as we are already under way developing a good system for the nation
525657 it was not wisely planned it was underfunded and we rushed into another decision that left us with a gap
525658 and the shuttle as marvelous as it is has not lived up to its expectations
525659 with the lower reimbursement from insurance companys its very difficult for independent pharmacys to sustain and be sustainable so what we have had to do is differentiate our services
525660 i dont want people to die this death when we can make a difference
525661 for some families its painful to leave out pictures but we keep his pictures around to see because we are all connected in our memories
525662 a loss of interest in the things they enjoy withdrawal from family and friends isolation
525663 please ask for help suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem but there is help
525664 they will tell you yes and sometimes they wont but they will be relieved you asked
525665 you dont know whats on the other side of your suffering because things can change they can get better
525666 greg your holy mole cookies were a big hit with my class it was all i could do to hold on to three of them for myself my husband and kate evelyns coauthor oh and we took a vote on whether they were not hot enough just right or too hot no one thought that they were too hot of 18 students exactly half 9 said that they were just right and half 9 said that they were not hot enough they insisted that i break the tie i thought that they werent hot enough
525667 the chocolate chipotle cookies taste great we suggest more chipotle and less cinnamon before tasting the cookies we were skeptical but now we are believers in the power of the chocolate chipotle cookies the aroma is sweet and enticing while the taste reveals a chipotle cinnamony flavor and we ate every bit mmm mmm good these cookies will convert skeptics who believe chipotle and cookies dont complement one another
525668 first of all thank you for the cookies we were having a hard time typing this as we couldnt seem to put this cookie down it was very good and tasted quite different from what weve tasted before we would suggest a little less cinnamon and maybe add some nuts the chili doesnt seem to have enough kick down here we all have had a jalapeno since we could eat solid foods we suggest a mild medium and hot recipe we think this is the mild version overall the cookie tastes quite good we appreciate what you do and thank you very much for including us
525669 those are fanny packs and i m having nothing to do with them
525670 not one person in my neighbourhood has a building permit
525671 illegal building is simply a pretext for destroying palestinian families homes and lives
525672 the demolitions are part of a policy to stop the natural expansion of palestinian communities in and around jerusalem freeing up the maximum amount of land for use by israeli settlers
525673 the demolitions increase the pressure on palestinians to move into the west bank so that they will lose their residency rights in the city
525674 this is the first time a government has supported the rebuilding of an illegal palestinian home demolished by the israeli authorities
525675 we estimate that there have been at least 18 000 homes destroyed during the four decades of occupation
525676 most demolitions are of multi storey buildings that are home to several families meaning that well in excess of 100 000 palestinians may have been made homeless by israeli administrative policies
525677 its one thing to destroy a home supposedly built illegally by a palestinian but another to destroy one built with money provided by the spanish government
525678 it was an eye opener to realise that the principles of urban planning we are taught at the university are being used by the israelis but for exactly the opposite purpose from the one usually intended the planning rules here are designed not to improve the palestinians lives but to make them more miserable
525679 imagine your children leaving in the morning for school and returning later in the day to find their home their whole world has disappeared while they were gone
525680 its happened to my children four times its cruelty beyond words
525681 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
525682 a durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the wright brothers
525683 indeed if a farsighted capitalist had been present at kitty hawk he would have done his successors a huge favour by shooting orville down
525684 iberia is very interesting to us but the deal is not transformational
525685 even if they achieve only half that its double the 100m profits we reckon the combined airline will make in 2009
525686 i think ba could survive as an independent carrier but we are starting to look small compared to other carriers that are consolidating
525687 the deteriorating log will be replaced with one that is cut from a downed tree at first they wanted to make an artificial one however the birders insisted they use a natural one
525688 virginias greatest natural energy endowment is not the coal seams of southwest virginia but the windy expanse of the continental shelf the potential for generating electricity through windpower is orders of magnitude greater off the coast than it is inland and unlike virginias coal reserves which are rapidly depleting wind is renewable
525689 the energy needs of most of the east coast could be met or even surpassed with the installation of over 160 000 turbines
525690 the low frequency of calms the high frequency of wind class 3 and above the low impact of hurricanes and the shallow of the coastal ocean make the virginia coastal ocean a unique place for offshore wind energy development
525691 wind power could represent a two fer for virginia not only is wind a non polluting source of energy it could form the basis of a major new industry who would be better equipped to fabricate the massive wind turbines which are the size of boeing 747s and then install them in 50 feet of water than the steel benders in the norfolk newport news ship building repair sector if virginia gets the jump on neighboring states hampton roads could become the center of a vibrant new industry
525692 a s the former chairman of a small manufacturing company i can say that industry in this country must retool and find new solutions to rising energy costs before the year 2020 when new energy might just might come on line from this proposal
525693 this is the only reality there is if you can get it down on paper in words notes or color so much the better
525694 navteq is excited to be a part of the 2008 esri international user conference along with some of our most innovative customers and end users
525695 through this years activities we will also illustrate how our map data is collected in a live environment and applied in real life solutions to create the most comprehensive database available
525696 this saturday morning i was watching cnn and even if i dont understand english that well i saw that something strange was going on
525697 it is sincerely bad that some media reports preceded the governments announcement
525698 if the foreign ministry received communication from the us government then it should either report to the prime ministers office or make a public announcement
525699 i think it is extremely regrettable that the information was delayed
525700 even if it was a very minor leak we would like to have a firm grasp of the information we want to explain to local citizens consistently
525701 even if the leak this time is not dangerous i want that kind of accident to never happen
525702 residents want to know that kind of information immediately so i really dont understand why authorities need to hide it

525705 when you only have three balls hit to you you dont have to do too much moving
525706 like i explained to him he only has to go out there when he feels good and good enough to where he feels like he can give us a chance to win with him being out there
525707 but if he doesnt feel like his body is going to allow that on a particular day all hes got to do is go to ozzie guillen
525708 i think he wanted me to know in case i didnt know not to expect what we were used to seeing out there
525709 thats the reason i said you only play when you feel great when you dont feel great or dont feel healthy thats ok we have plenty of options
525710 i told him that its not as if hes replacing the prototypical guy that was already out there
525711 listen im not trying to kid anybody about having all the answers
525712 if this works great home run if it doesnt its still a double well find a way to make it work and still have what he can give us offensively
525713 the bloggers will wind down and cool off by summer
525714 for the time trial theres no hiding and every day that i miss training is seconds and therefore places in the result
525715 i wouldnt want to deprive mick rogers of an opportunity to do what is our our best chance to get a result for the team
525716 shayne bannan called me with the news and i was on the table getting treatment with my knee all bandaged up in ice and an electro stimulator attached and he said weve got that second place
525717 i looked at my swollen knee and thought oh good for you
525718 but lets see how it goes and first concentrate on getting my knee better and see if im worthy of going for the road race and seeing if i can be good enough for the road race
525719 then beyond that for me to go and start the time trial id have to have a pretty stellar ride in the road race
525720 every day im doing the physio and treatment on my knee and every day getting better but well decide on monday morning whether i go or adam hansen goes in my place
525721 i dont want to go unless i can do a good result for myself and the team or contribute to a good result for the team so if i dont recover from my injury and am not close to my best i dont mind staying at home

525724 spurs supporters will be disappointed because robbie was such a fine servant and talent he rarely missed games he was rarely injured
525725 and he was a regular goal scorer someone the supporters could always hang their hat on
525726 hed done brilliantly for spurs and now theyve done brilliantly by him they bought him for 6m i was prominent in the deal and theyve sold him for a good profit after hes played consistently over a number of seasons thats good business tottenham have done okay
525727 it was the sensible thing to do the boys 28 wanted to go and theyve got a good price
525728 he could have played there for another three years but maybe it was right for him to move its good for him and for both clubs
525729 robbie is completely unflappable nerveless apart from wonderful skill drifting behind
525730 hows his wife what are the children up to how is his brother who is dying from some flesh eating disease
525731 its amazing how long a love can last and how quickly it can end
525732 you dont die over a broken heart you only wish you did
525733 you never know what you have lost till you are standing in a room with that person not being able to call them yours
525734 there are few things sadder in life then watching someone walk away after they left you watching the distance between your bodies expand until there is nothing left but empty space and silence
525735 sometimes when you hold out for everything you walk away with nothing
525736 instead of thinking about what youre missing try thinking about what you have that everyone else is missing
525737 even if a child was born the woman still had the right to kill the child in an abortion
525738 a fter a childs born obama in the illinois state senate wanted the child killed if the mother desired an abortion
525739 obamas on record as lets kill the baby if thats what the mother wants
525740 they want to know where their food comes from they want to know who their growers are and how that food is being grown
525741 youre representing everybody who played before you and kind of paved the way to be here its an honor for me and all the other guys to play in it
525742 were students of the game we like the history as well as the present were going to go enjoy it then when the whistle blows and the ball is kicked were going to go play football
525743 to pay homage to all the football players from the past
525744 there are amazing stories and to go and see that it will be real humbling
525745 its an honor to even be able to go check it out were going on a very important weekend ive never really had the opportunity i dont get to canton much but this is a great opportunity for everyone on the team to go check it out and see what youre shooting for
525746 as far as personal goals thats the pinnacle of everyones goal i would imagine
525747 especially our young guys when they see some of the exhibits and see some of the guys who are in there it will be a little bit special
525748 hopefully our guys will have a feel of what theyll be a part of
525749 i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
525750 what smith did was wrong and we take very serious and he is being punished severely for it
525751 he knows what those are and we will move forward
525752 ken got overwhelmed with every single player coming up to him and telling him hello
525753 i think it was great that he came out today a lesser person would not have come out but he did and we cant wait to get him back
525754 i know hes extremely remorseful and he understands but if we want to be a good football team we have to win without him
525755 theres progress being made i wouldnt say as much as id like at this point so were going to continue to push him
525756 i think pushing him back into two a days will help him as well
525757 id love to manage again see if i could get back on the wheel again
525758 i grew up here this is where i learned how to be a winner here be a champion here
525759 its a little different a little bit of a transition
525760 im a lifer im a grinder i didnt get fired at the end of the season
525761 you go back and look at the replay of the play that he argued i think he had a right to argue
525762 i think if the umpire watched that replay youd get him to admit that he missed that call for him to get a suspension for that i dont think its right
525763 you kick your hat and then all the havoc that went on afterwards i figured id get a little bit of a fine i didnt know about the suspension
525764 the trip was getting to him and i got into him pretty good
525765 a big supporter of mine at united artists music he said there are these two guys called albert broccoli and they own the rights to the james bond stories i said i only know bond from the daily mail comic strip he said thats all you need to know they wanted a theme two minutes long
525766 you need to have the largesse of john barry and be true to ian fleming the suggestiveness of don blacks lyrics still make me smile but it cant be plagiarism paul mccartney did it taking it out of john barrys hands he worked it beautifully its a big big track big bangs work well because you want to have a little snigger you want to go oooh
525767 the most successful songs and those that are now deemed bond classics are invariably the ones with a narrative within the lyrics
525768 because nobody did no it is a terrific song as it embodies everything about bonds character and why he is better and more popular than other movie spies

525771 there have already been two deaths of two new york city pedestrians who were said to have been walking and texting
525772 the brains ability to take on several activities at once makes text walking possible researchers say but its a delicate balancing act all it takes is one unexpected disruption to turn a text walk into a garble stumble
525773 the fact that 56 000 americans each year are contracting hiv for the first time is a wake up call for all of us in the u s
525774 every year more than 15 000 people are dying from this disease and aids is a major killer for some of our minority communities
525775 the key thing we have to focus on now is what how and when do we begin to enhance the prevention responses to end this epidemic
525776 aku yang paling cepat berlari aku tidak bisa dikalahkan dalam pertandingan
525777 siapa yang mau menantangku dalam bertanding lari aku yakin aku akan menang
525778 wah lelucon yang sangat lucu aku bisa menari nari disekitarmu sepanjang pertandingan
525779 i cant feel sorry for this pair if they were having problems paying their mortgage last year why on earth is she four months pregnant
525780 theyve had severe financial problems for several months so its obviously the perfect time to bring another tiny person to care for into the mess people stun me
525781 when i was a kid there were advertisements in boys life and other magazines for red tails that you could send away for
525782 the ad i responded to wasnt real specific it said my bird would be selected from a falconry grab bag
525783 i wanted a red tail but they sent me an audubons cara cara which resembles a vulture i later traded it to the como zoo for a red tail
525784 it was the only way that meat protein could be acquired for the soldiers
525785 to be given a joint state federal permit requires about a years worth of study before a proficiency test is taken
525786 a score of at least 80 percent is required for passage
525787 during the apprenticeship only a red tail or kestrel can be kept and the apprentice must trap them himself
525788 the bird cant be a mature adult which are breeding birds nor can it be an eyas or baby in the nest
525789 it makes you want to behave badly which i do
525790 but i wonder if its just me being another angry old fart
525791 in my late teens and twenties i was in love all the time
525792 now girls are expected to have sex before theyre 12 which is terrible it really upsets me when silly girls get as drunk and aggressive as boys my skin crawls when i see laddish women presenting television shows who almost slap their thighs as if theyre in panto i think stop this isnt what we meant by feminism its gone completely wrong women think they can have a fantastic career and four children and knock themselves out trying to do it all
525793 i dont like to advocate binge drinking but it happens
525794 girls in cardiff can drink me mainly a night out should consist of a lot of alcohol an outfit which looks good at the start of the night and is in tatters at the end lots of dancing so you get so sweaty your hair looks like youve been in the rain followed by a big ass meal like a doner kebab
525795 young women who behave in a boisterously assertive or crude manner and engage in heavy drinking sessions
525796 in spite of these exceptional levels the sound was virtually free of any distortion
525797 after the systems arrived back at westfalen sound we checked them and found that none suffered even the slightest damage i think that speaks for itself
525798 he stated when talking to investigators that his rent was due and he did not want to ask his parents for money so he felt that he had no options
525799 a grand salon a throwback to new york of old
525800 ask the average guy if he knows or has heard of rubin chances are he has but not rattner
525801 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
525802 ride the wave for as long as you can and just enjoy it lifes not that serious so make good friendships along the way enjoy yourself and have fun
525803 if thats the one thing i can tell the contestants then thats fine other than that ill just have fun with them
525804 its going to be tough for sure so i wish them all the luck in the world
525805 but theres been some amazing talent come through the doors and i really think they have a chance to go all the way here
525806 youve just got that huge mix of personalities and when you mix that together plus there could be relationships evolving with guys and girls well it could be quite interesting
525807 its a competition so while they might make friendships while theyre here i dont think it will be their highest priority
525808 it was made into a bad movie in the 1970s starring the admirable george c scott
525809 but i have always been convinced that theres a great movie in this book and this is the one we are going to make
525810 i said from the start if we got the boat right then the rest would fit into place it has to go from being a fishing boat in the first half of the film to a war vessel in the second half it was vital to me that it was genuinely built before the second world war so the hunt was on from the moment we got the go ahead for the movie
525811 its a 38ft american motor cabin cruiser a wooden hull 11 ft beam 3 ft draught a perfect match to the boat hemingway described
525812 it used to have a four cylinder flathead chrysler diesel engine but someone replaced it with a v8 general motors gasoline car engine it turned the boat into a virtual bomb it looked like a bucket of rusty bolts so i sent some guys to move it to a good boatyard
525813 it was 12 knots on a boat which was not seaworthy after a nine hour journey we navigated in by torchlight to the new yard
525814 we will then take her to an undisclosed location and protect her like an unborn child
525815 but it means that you will see 27m of the 32m on the screen there are certain things that are meant to be and if youre lucky enough in life to eventually get there then that is a great achievement this is the project that is meant to be for me
525816 i put a lot of myself in to those roles
525817 in the valley of elah was an important film because we were looking at how the iraq war impacts on local communities across america with the loss of family members its a tragedy that carries on
525818 he is so focused tommy never wants to waste time and sometimes we were having a bit too much fun for him
525819 my belief is that we should never waste a day
525820 and when you are working and acting is our work there should be total concentration on what you are trying to achieve anything less than that then you are cheating yourself and short changing others
525821 in the end i didnt think i could make it as a professional sportsman so i thought that acting could make a great alternative life
525822 its still sport of a kind with winners and losers you also have to be fit to survive its not that first or second part or even big role which is so difficult its maintaining it over years
525823 no im a private person i hate everything about this business that intrudes on my life including these interviews but i do them to promote the movies because it helps people im fond of
525824 there is a terrific battle between an 11 year old boy and a 1 000lb blue marlin which i am looking forward to filming that is when the boat comes into its own
525825 this movie might be set in the past but it is about you and me now
525826 it is not a chick flick not a thriller killer not a quirky romance
525827 i want it to be a really good movie exciting from minute to minute frame to frame this is for people who want to see something different
525828 be what you would seem to be or if youd like it put more simply never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise i think i should understand that better alice said very politely if i had it written down but i cant quite follow it as you say it thats nothing to what i could say if i chose the duchess replied in a pleased tone
525829 would you tell me please which way i ought to walk from here that depends a good deal on where you want to get to said the cat i dont much care where said alice then it doesnt matter which way you walk said the cat so long as i get somewhere alice added as an explanation oh youre sure to do that said the cat if you only walk long enough
525830 getting rid of all the stuff i have been storing in various places since july of 2006 by the time i settled in for a couple of hours in davids garage just going through stuff and filling up garbage bags and wondering why i still had certain things that id actually shipped to california from miami in 1993 when i went away to college
525831 though realizing that many other factors were involved i reasoned that if we could get a freer flow of trade freer in the sense of fewer discriminations and obstructions so that one country would not be deadly jealous of another and the living standards of all countries might rise thereby eliminating the economic dissatisfaction that breeds war we might have a reasonable chance for lasting peace
525832 the greatest act of political courage that i have ever witnessed
525833 it would of course be impractical to suggest living in a less hygienic environment or changing living conditions in order to afford possible protection from future development of ibd
525834 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
525835 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
525836 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
525837 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
525838 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
525839 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
525840 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
525841 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
525842 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
525843 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
525844 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
525845 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
525846 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
525847 for three decades ive heard speakers say things similar to what ive heard today thirty years ago they were called doomsdayers today we know enough to respect their opinions but we still havent changed our lifestyles i take good care of my clothes and they last a long time i have short cold showers and i dont own a car these solutions arent complex theyre right before every one of us
525848 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
525849 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
525850 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees

525852 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
525853 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
525854 but i resent when you throw out stupid allegations that have no merit and really no purpose other than to inflame
525855 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father rom 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body rom 9 4 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises gal 4 5 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons eph 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will
525856 i object to the gentleman from california vote being counted he came down and voted late he said he was not in the chamber when his name was called and therefore hes not entitled to vote
525857 cleve youre wrong chet was back there behind the rail and i was standing by him when he answered his answer just wasnt heard
525858 green homes are shining through as the bright spot in an otherwise gloomy housing market
525859 this twin crisis of peak oil and climate change is spurring innovation experimentation and excitement
525860 these big challenges are what the u s is best at frankly
525861 by providing guidelines and strategies in essence our job is to keep saying yes its possible heres how
525862 there are a zillion different codes and standards out there
525863 we want to make it much easier for people to adopt our goals
525864 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
525865 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
525866 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
525867 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
525868 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
525869 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
525870 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
525871 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
525872 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
525873 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
525874 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
525875 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
525876 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
525877 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
525878 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded

525881 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
525882 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
525883 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
525884 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
525885 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
525886 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
525887 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
525888 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
525889 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
525890 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
525891 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
525892 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
525893 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
525894 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
525895 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
525896 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
525897 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
525898 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
525899 beware of those powers which come from god but which can so easily be purloined by the devil
525900 a certain quality of an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural or exceptional powers or qualities
525901 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
525902 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
525903 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
525904 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
525905 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
525906 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
525907 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
525908 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
525909 lets put a man on the moon in 10 years
525910 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
525911 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
525912 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
525913 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
525914 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
525915 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
525916 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
525917 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
525918 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
525919 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
525920 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
525921 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
525922 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
525923 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
525924 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
525925 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
525926 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
525927 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm

525929 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
525930 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
525931 will his policies keep my family safer healthier and more prosperous
525932 liberals mock americans who love their country calling them cowboys warmongers religious zealots and jingoists liberals relentlessly oppose the military the pledge of allegiance the flag and national defense liberals malign the flag ban the pledge and hold cocktail parties for americas enemies
525933 anti flag anti family criminal rights welfare traitors endanger bizarre radical sick corrupt
525934 were doing all these message events why dont we try a messenger event why dont we find the kind of venue topic setting format atmosphere that highlights gore at his best and most likable people dont vote for issues they vote for a candidate lets show them the candidate
525935 did you see gore hes totally different he should run for president
525936 gore is not different gore is immutable that was a messenger event
525937 gloried in cultural warfare dividing the nation geographically generationally racially religiously he believed that was what all politicians did
525938 i apologize for it i did not know about these remarks but i take responsibility for them i repudiate them i will certainly make sure that nothing like that happens again
525939 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
525940 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
525941 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
525942 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
525943 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
525944 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
525945 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
525946 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
525947 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
525948 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
525949 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
525950 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
525951 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
525952 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
525953 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
525954 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
525955 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
525956 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
525957 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
525958 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
525959 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
525960 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
525961 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
525962 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
525963 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
525964 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
525965 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
525966 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
525967 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
525968 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
525969 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
525970 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
525971 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
525972 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
525973 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
525974 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
525975 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
525976 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
525977 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
525978 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
525979 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
525980 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
525981 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
525982 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
525983 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
525984 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
525985 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
525986 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
525987 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
525988 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
525989 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
525990 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
525991 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
525992 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
525993 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
525994 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
525995 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
525996 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
525997 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
525998 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
525999 its not a distraction to rice but its a distraction to the other competitors because it puts a giant cross on your shoulders and they will do everything they can to bring you down
526000 of course shes taken a risk but no pain no gain in the commercial world
526001 life was like a box of chocolates you never know what youre gonna get
526002 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
526003 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
526004 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
526005 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
526006 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
526007 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
526008 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
526009 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
526010 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
526011 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
526012 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
526013 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
526014 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
526015 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
526016 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
526017 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
526018 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
526019 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
526020 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
526021 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
526022 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
526023 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
526024 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
526025 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
526026 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
526027 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
526028 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
526029 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
526030 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
526031 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
526032 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
526033 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
526034 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
526035 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
526036 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
526037 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
526038 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
526039 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
526040 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
526041 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
526042 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
526043 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
526044 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
526045 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
526046 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
526047 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
526048 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
526049 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
526050 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
526051 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
526052 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
526053 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
526054 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
526055 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
526056 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
526057 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
526058 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
526059 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
526060 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
526061 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
526062 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
526063 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
526064 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
526065 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
526066 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
526067 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
526068 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
526069 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
526070 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
526071 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
526072 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
526073 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
526074 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
526075 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
526076 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
526077 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
526078 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
526079 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
526080 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
526081 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
526082 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
526083 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
526084 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
526085 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
526086 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
526087 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
526088 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
526089 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
526090 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
526091 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
526092 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
526093 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
526094 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
526095 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
526096 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
526097 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
526098 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
526099 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
526100 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
526101 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
526102 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
526103 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
526104 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
526105 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
526106 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
526107 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
526108 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
526109 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
526110 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
526111 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
526112 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
526113 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
526114 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
526115 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
526116 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
526117 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
526118 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
526119 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
526120 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
526121 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
526122 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
526123 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
526124 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
526125 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
526126 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
526127 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
526128 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
526129 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
526130 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
526131 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
526132 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
526133 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
526134 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
526135 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
526136 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
526137 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
526138 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
526139 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
526140 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
526141 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
526142 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
526143 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
526144 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq

526149 i think we should be in a post racial environment
526150 i think sen barack obama has done an admirable job of that i dont think he has race baited i think he has been very good about that
526151 the presumptive republican nominee has embarked on a bare knuckled barrage of negative advertising aimed at belittling mr obama
526152 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate

526154 sen john mccain of arizona is the only republican who promises to end the george bush style of governing from and on behalf of a small angry fringe
526155 mccain is still i think upset about the op ed not being printed
526156 a lot of the maverick positioning is now turning into more conservative positioning and some of that includes not being afraid to go negative not being afraid to call a liberal a liberal and not being afraid to go after a newspaper
526157 latte drinking sushi eating volvo driving new york times reading
526158 has really become a symbol for a lot of conservative grievances
526159 for starters their editorials are decidedly liberal thats a no brainer and there are often complaints that even their general reporting is biased in subtle and not so subtle ways the new york times has come to be associated with the northeast liberal establishment
526160 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products
526161 as a result our downstream operations incurred a loss in the second quarter with most of the loss taking place in the united states

526164 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
526165 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
526166 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
526167 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
526168 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
526169 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
526170 everybodys trying to figure out how to lower levels of acrylamide without significantly adversely affecting taste
526171 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
526172 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
526173 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
526174 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
526175 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
526176 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
526177 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
526178 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
526179 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
526180 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

526182 russell mesler is a lawrence resident and an emeritus professor in kansas universitys department of chemical and petroleum engineering

526185 where does uranium fuel come from canada australia the former soviet union and africa the last time i checked how does this make us less reliant on foreign sources how long is the uranium supply supposed to last at current consumption 50 years
526186 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
526187 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
526188 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
526189 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
526190 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
526191 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
526192 asbestos and the columnist talked about the subsidies that wind gets
526193 they just got 10 billion taxpayer dollars in the energy policy act of 2005 to jumpstart the moribund industry and utilities were given until the end of 2008 to sign up for a new nuke and qualify for the huge taxbreaks cost sharing and risk insurance protection in the package
526194 sorry dude but that was the point of the article there is only 386
526195 1 3 wind turbines will not produce power efficiently below a wind speed of 15mph they must be disengaged at wind speeds over 50mph to prevent damage to the turbine they also require a fairly demanding amount of maintenance
526196 wind and pv systems should be installed in every house in the united states for those people that want to participate to offset their energy bill
526197 short term threat to the growth of wind energy is the looming expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this year but the wind industry should not ask for more government support it should be made to stand on its own
526198 have you conducted an energy audit on your system capital operational maintenance revenue all in joules if your system doesnt produce more energy than it took to make maintain operate and dispose then dont bother
526199 asbestos i stand by my talking about per capita energy consumption and california per capita consumption has stayed flat for the past 30 years look it up
526200 as a taxpayer this is a poor use of my monies and i might add it a poor use of my monies collected by utilities as a ratepayer
526201 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
526202 wind energy away pretty clear that the author was correct and he was stating in the 300
526203 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
526204 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
526205 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
526206 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green

526217 there are british passport holders who live in the u k who are being found in places like kandahar
526218 while my troops have not actually found british passports on enemy dead there has been a suspicion that with the high number of taliban casualties they have needed to recruit a lot of foreign fighters and some of these are likely to be of british muslim descent
526219 its definitely clear that the rs is not part of such a scenario because she has her legitimacy
526220 the problem is that some people in sarajevo should wake up look left and right and realise that the rs is there it will remain there permanently
526221 he wanted to leave chelsea i am certain of that although it created a lot of anxiety for him he stayed for his dad

526225 the offer of an online market will improve the income and livelihood of people with shgs in rural areas
526226 the anxiety to create more shgs to comply with policy decisions of the government has led to the splitting of existing groups it disturbs the functioning of the existing groups this affects the recovery rates
526227 i know i couldnt be on my legs for four to eight hours
526228 there is not a human being who would look at this person and say that she is not disabled
526229 we bought a mobile home and we thought we would be able to live in it comfortably for the rest of our lives
526230 to me its encouraging that women are aware of and understand their risks and they are concerned about the right things
526231 the reality is that because women live longer they have to have a larger nest egg to fund that longer retirement period
526232 another five years can add up to a goodly sum of money

526241 they handle the pitching staff well and they follow the game plan
526242 i cant believe how good i threw i told the training staff before i threw today i said the last two days ive felt a 200 percent difference in my hand just holding stuff grabbing things even grabbing a remote or something it just felt good all of a sudden
526243 hes making the kind of progress that were looking for
526244 todays throw was by far the best that hes had i think hes ready to take the next step
526245 today i went at it 100 percent and tested it completely
526246 were going to start off with the thought that were going to condition him for the starting rotation and thats probably what were going to do
526247 but you dont know what situation the club is going to be two weeks from now
526248 seems like he gets to a certain point where he doesnt finish pitches
526249 when you have to fight through the pitching problems you normally have problems that usually mean you are struggling you are fighting your butt off to survive and i think were doing it but were working pretty hard
526250 i think if you could pitch them and everything is right then i think by september you might have them normal
526251 but so far you havent been able to do that
526252 i would like to thank the cincinnati reds organization for allowing me to fulfill a lifelong dream of playing for my hometown team
526253 i will always value the lasting friendships i have with the lindner castellini and williams families while my nine seasons there were filled with personal highlights like hitting my 400th 500th and 600th home runs in a reds uniform and the negatives of having to fight through too many injuries my biggest regret is that we were not able to win a world series championship while i was there
526254 last but certainly not least i would like to thank reds fans for their support
526255 i really do understand that the overwhelming majority of fans wanted so badly for me to succeed
526256 additionally i would like to sincerely apologize to those fans offended by my wrongful actions last saturday night
526257 it was an overreaction on my part to what i felt was a series of public inaccurate and unfair remarks about me
526258 i wish nothing but success for the reds both on and off the field
526259 theyre going to let me know tonight what they want to do
526260 i dont think its any worse than its been for the last five weeks i told them i want to play so i think i might get some type of injection in the next couple of days or something i dont know i actually just asked the trainers and they told me theyd let me know tonight were going to talk to team medical director dr thomas gill
526261 i was sore one day and it really hasnt gone away weve tried heat stretch stim ultrasound massage i got a cortisone shot before the all star break
526262 i dont know weve kind of exhausted everything its just been a nagging thing that hasnt gone away but it only bothers me to run so i really cant say its affected me swinging or affected me throwing im just kind of hoping it goes away but it really hasnt
526263 hes been fighting this for a long time hes a tough kid speed has never been a big part of what hes doing hell acknowledge that but i dont want to not acknowledge that he is toughing this one out
526264 thats why i think were going to talk to doc gill and see what he wants to do maybe with a supersonic anti inflammatory to see if it can calm down its something that hinders me in one aspect of the game but fortunately its not a major aspect of the game for me i think we can live
526265 con ben nos preguntamos c mo ser a tener otro hijo quiz s pronto lo sepamos

526268 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
526269 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
526270 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
526271 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
526272 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
526273 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
526274 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
526275 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
526276 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
526277 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
526278 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
526279 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
526280 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
526281 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
526282 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
526283 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people
526284 be the change that you want to see in the world
526285 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
526286 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day
526287 people have the idea that i fall for every teen pop sensation that comes out that is not true maybe ive become so desperate that ive gotten to the point of defending her for no reason so i can feel as if im a part of something who knows all i know is that people have no right to talk trash about her as if they have met her in person and im beginning to think a large number of them are jealous as for her being immature i see nothing wrong with it at her age
526288 why i need to dump another 1 300 into my car
526289 my hometown is the best place in the state to live
526290 old joe smith would never make a good president because an old dog cant learn new tricks

526309 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honour the commitments made to the international community
526310 chinese human rights activists are being detained harassed or forced to leave beijing while their supporters abroad are being prevented from going to china it is against this backdrop that the chinese government and the international olympic committee ioc plan to launch the 2008 summer olympics
526311 must have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games
526312 im not going to make an apology for something the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
526313 you see weve done it you can even see the mountains
526314 i dont think that politicising the olympic games will do anything good to addressing any of the issues
526315 did you know china raised petrol prices for the first time in 18 months recently analysts say it is because of the rising cost of oil around the world
526316 i cannot give you a date but it will be as soon as possible
526317 i would rather receive the new indictment and have sufficient time to study it and then have my initial appearance for that and enter my plea
526318 of course its a waste of time and they should have amended the indictment before
526319 we have made some terrible mistakes in iraq and it is only by talking about them that we will learn from them
526320 last autumn we made a mistake which was understandable but not excusable a shia prisoner ahmed al fartusi said he could put a stop to the killings we released 120 of their prisoners and withdrew out of town but when we moved out lawlessness took over as 90 per cent of the attacks were against us we thought if we moved out we would remove the source of the problem but actually the jaish al mahdi the mahdi army known to british troops as the jam had been fighting us because we were the only obstacle to their total control
526321 as if the problems were more about a few criminal tribes and families than religious groups baghdad thought basra was easy to solve and didnt fully understand the extent of the problem plus the americans with their obligations in mosul and elsewhere believed basra could look after itself it was compounded by having little guidance from above as to whether we were right to accept the deal
526322 there was a sense that no one was making policy in london
526323 if that was my child i would be doing exactly the same thing
526324 we have been struggling with cut price competition from abroad for years
526325 we dont belong to any consortium and our prices are the same as they have been since 2003 21 a day which is good value for beautiful sand and clean water
526326 whenever the enemies have failed against this nation they have tried to make excuses but the iranian nation will stand against them with its power
526327 the iranians have had more than enough time to respond
526328 if iran doesnt choose to engage there is no option but further sanctions
526329 as soon as 2010 iran will have the option to reach uranium production at military levels
526330 we will start the campaign in beijing next week and we will use the games as a catalyst to get chinese companies over
526331 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
526332 these are crucial aspects of our historical and cultural heritage and every effort must be made to bring them back
526333 but the field museum say they bought them legally we are following a diplomatic route which we hope will be successful
526334 the blanket return of objects to their home countries would discourage cultural tourism
526335 we want people in britain to see kenyan artefacts at their own museums but the most important ones must come home
526336 smart outgoing confident and affectionate she will converse with anyone has a large vocabulary uses big words and speaks with a british accent
526337 her favorite colour is pink and she loves the book and the movie the little princess
526338 it turns out that it was in fact a father and a little boy
526339 i would like to thank the cincinnati reds organization for allowing me to fulfill a lifelong dream of playing for my hometown team i will always value the lasting friendships i have with the lindner castellini and williams families while my nine seasons there were filled with personal highlights like hitting my 400th 500th and 600th home runs in a reds uniform and the negatives of having to fight through too many injuries my biggest regret is that we were not able to win a world championship while i was there i also would like to thank my many teammates managers coaches and reds employees for their help and support and to acknowledge the many friendly relationships i had with most of the members of the local media i will miss the banter last but certainly not least i would like to thank reds fans for their support i really do understand that the overwhelming majority of fans wanted so badly for me to succeed additionally i would like to sincerely apologize to those fans offended by my wrongful actions last saturday night it was an overreaction on my part to what i felt was a series of public inaccurate and unfair remarks about me
526340 this is a group where someone will have to emerge especially inside
526341 covington and navarre could be a force in the pass rush
526342 trey is playing his best football he had a very good spring
526343 dominique is a little undersized but were trying to get some more speed on the field
526344 alex is a guy who can affect tempo and effort
526345 i was surprised how good the scoring was because standing on the range you felt like the golf course was going to play pretty tough since we didnt get the rain overnight as expected and it felt like it was going to dry out as the day went on
526346 i wanted to come out quick and birdie birdie birdie was obviously great but i played pretty solid all day
526347 it could have been a better round than that but youve got to take what it gives you a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference
526348 im excited that im tied for the lead going into the final round
526349 i think itll be a fun shootout theres four guys right there and then theres a big grouping four shots back
526350 so i think that were all in good position i feel like ive played well the first three rounds and im looking forward to a nice shootout tomorrow
526351 i played a nice nine holes and got myself back in the championship
526352 monday was a tough day but i got out here tuesday and said theres another championship to be had this week
526353 maybe i can do it i will play my best tomorrow
526354 the big miss was the birdie putt on 15 i couldnt have had an easier putt
526355 if youre a little off it gets exaggerated a little bit
526356 i am passing this message on to gb not in these terms and will try to help but at present there is every indication that the lessons will not be learnt
526357 there has been a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy we joined in the attack on our own ten years a fatal mistake we junked the tb policy agenda but had nothing to put in its place
526358 the real problem was not the brilliance of the tory conference but the hubris and vacuity of our own this meant the tories by having something to say on policy appeared substantial and to represent the future
526359 and yet we have a multitude of small policies and worthy initiatives that are more suited to a sunday afternoon stroll
526360 we desperately need policies that will change the political weather things are really tough for labour at the moment
526361 i believe we can still win the next election but labour has to show we are in touch with the needs of people
526362 as david miliband said earlier this week labour has to refresh itself that is not just a question about gordon browns leadership but must also include the policies we put forward
526363 at a time when the whole of the labour party is trying to come together to deal with the economic crisis and defeat the tories its disappointing that tony blairs friends are trying to cause internal rows with these leaked memos and their personal attacks on gordon
526364 tony should tell his friends to stop causing trouble and let gordon get on with the job
526365 these cases might have just been isolated incidents that were not preventable or not foreseen
526366 i can tell you anecdotally our concern is looking at systemic issues surrounding those kids in care weve done some preliminary analysis of these cases and have not found any systemic issues
526367 there really isnt as much distance between sir freds valuation and the price coming from the bidder
526368 after their knight vinkes showing at the recent agm i doubt theyd have the gall to pop up again
526369 smart outgoing confident and affectionate she will converse with anyone has a large vocabulary uses big words and speaks with a british accent
526370 her favorite colour is pink and she loves the book and the movie the little princess
526371 it turns out that it was in fact a father and a little boy
526372 i dont think the police will find her killer now its too late for that theres no new evidence no new witnesses after eight years
526373 we are considering the ramifications of the jurys verdict before we do anything else
526374 it can be difficult with cold case reviews because the whos wheres and whens in the witness statements arent going to change
526375 if you havent got any new forensics it can be tricky to find new leads
526376 i dont want to spend any more time in any of her majestys holiday camps
526377 its not a celebration barry was locked away for eight years for something he didnt do
526378 i was struck by the fact there was a huge demand in the uk for somebodys head the pressure on the police must have been enormous
526379 i think the pressure is mounting to the point that there is a greater degree of support in the legislature
526380 a lot of the pieces of legislation that were talked about last time are fairly close to i think what we can pass and certainly i think a tough realistic animal cruelty law a felony on animal cruelty will be forthcoming and i support that

526387 his will be done on earth as it is in heaven
526388 therefore strengthen the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet so that what is lame may not be dislocated but rather be healed
526389 you ask and do not receive because you ask amiss that you may spend it on your pleasures

526450 this might be the best thing youve ever come up with
526451 quando o leonardo come ou a sair era eu quem levava ele para todo lugar at em boate j fui mas n o ficava com a turma
526452 eu esperava ele chegar mas se ele demorava muito eu ia busc lo na festa e ele ficava constrangido
526453 em boate eu n o deixava ele ir porque n o podia entrar
526454 sempre ligo para saber onde ele est e quando ele chega eu levanto para ver em que estado ficou depois da festa
526455 temos um bom relacionamento conversamos muito e ainda consigo convenc lo a n o ir a determinada balada se acho perigoso
526456 ele j sabe que se a m e de fulano n o deixar ele n o tamb m n o sai
526457 acabo adormecendo mas durmo preocupado minha esposa que sempre liga pedindo para ele voltar cedo ele diz que est chegando mas nunca chega estou sempre dando bronca
526458 j falei para o guilherme que se ele for pego por causa de bebida ou se bater o carro na balada n o para me ligar que eu n o vou busc lo mas se o problema acontecer a caminho da escola ou do trabalho ele pode contar comigo

526461 meus dois filhos j tiveram o primeiro porre hist rico muita ressaca no dia seguinte mas nada fora do aceit vel bebidas e drogas s o relevantes pela forma incisiva como chegam aos jovens pela facilidade na aquisi o e pela liberdade de consumo nos bares e boates sei que alguns amigos dos meus filhos s o usu rios por exemplo mas a viol ncia preocupa mais porque n o depende s deles
526462 s vezes o pai permite tudo para n o se aborrecer ou porque n o tem tempo para monitorar o filho outros pro bem tudo o que tamb m n o saud vel assim como n o bacana frequentar a balada do filho fazendo isso n o se d a ele a chance de se tornar independente o pai que confia no filho e autoriza a sa da tamb m n o deve ficar na sala com a luz acesa esperando ele voltar e nem mandar abrir a boca para tentar rastrear se o jovem bebeu vistorie sim mas discretamente desconfian a infundada magoa
526463 se aos quatro anos o filho escolhe o canal de tv aos 18 ele pegar o carro sem autoriza o para sair noite os pais devem ter uma meta educacional uma coer ncia de atitudes n o resolve o pai deixar e a m e proibir se n o h padr o o jovem ser mais teimoso uma boa dica para argumentar apoiar se na lei por exemplo menores de 18 n o v o a baladas porque ilegal funciona mais do que dizer eu n o ia na minha poca voc n o vai fica parecendo vingan a mesmo assim vai ter choro cara feia e porta batida resistir a um n o normal mas os pais devem manter as regras que acharem razo veis para a maturidade do filho
526464 a crian a responde pelo prazer voc n o a convencer de que a vacina que d i boa na adolesc ncia o filho percebe que nem tudo que agrad vel pode ser feito que n o livre para fazer tudo mas o que permitido uma fase de bombardeio hormonal e contesta o para alguns a vontade de extravasar na balada a forma de auto afirma o de buscar a independ ncia ainda que seja uma busca de modo errado

526509 all in all there were some good points the touchdown to keller was nice it showcased his abilities a little bit
526510 as im watching this game part of it is watching those guys but part of it is watching all the other new guys part of it is trying to look at the scheme and how those guys are executing the scheme theres a lot of new faces to look at thats really going to come more from the tape than this first look
526511 i just thought the group as a whole did what i was looking for them to do in terms of tempo and effort
526512 kellen put the ball right where it needed to be so there was no thinking or looking back after that
526513 im fine but im not at liberty to discuss injuries

526543 la reestructuraci n de pdvsa busca adecuarla a los acuerdos con las transnacionales en el marco de las empresas mixtas
526544 la reestructuraci n de nuestra principal industria anunciada por el gobierno por boca del ministro presidente de pdvsa apunta a colocar a la empresa a tono con las pol ticas de acuerdos con transnacionales mediante la f rmula de empresas mixtas que lesionan gravemente la soberan a del pa s
526545 sin duda que pdvsa necesita una reestructuraci n profunda para ponerla realmente a tono con el proceso revolucionario y con los intereses de sus trabajadores y el pueblo venezolano es falso que pdvsa sea del pueblo como dice el slogan gubernamental por el contrario hoy la principal fuente de recursos con que cuenta el pa s se encuentra dirigida por una tecnoburocracia que se viste de rojo rojito pero que todos los d as humilla a los trabajadores abusa del poder y desoye los reclamos laborales una burocracia que repite los viejos m todos del pasado puntofijista que utiliza para su provecho los bienes de la empresa que ha convertido el ingreso a pdvsa en un privilegio de familia tal como hac an los gerentes y merit cratas de la iv rep blica hoy nuestra principal industria es dirigida por una caterva de sinverg enzas e incapaces que est n haciendo ca da y mesa limpia con los recursos de todo el pueblo creando una situaci n de alto riesgo debido al deterioro de las condiciones de higiene y seguridad industrial
526546 la propuesta de reestructuraci n de pdvsa que el gobierno est planteando es un tema de much sima importancia que debe ser conocido y abordado en profundidad por los trabajadores petroleros y por todos los venezolanos por la gran importancia que tiene el tema petrolero para la econom a del pa s una reestructuraci n del modelo de gesti n de pdvsa es un asunto estrat gico que no puede quedar en manos exclusivamente de un peque o sanedr n de 7 supercomisionados mucho menos si esta comisi n es nombrada por la misma tecnoburocracia roja rojita que desatiende los reclamos de los trabajadores y lleva al descalabro a nuestra m s importante empresa eso ser a como poner a un zamuro a cuidar carne por otra parte desde mi punto de vista queda claro que no se trata de modificar la gesti n interna de la empresa a favor de los trabajadores por el contrario lo que se busca es adecuar pdvsa a los acuerdos con el empresariado y con las transnacionales que hoy se benefician de las llamadas empresas mixtas esta reestructuraci n debe ser vista en el marco del acto del pasado 11 de junio con la alta burgues a nacional tambi n debe ser considerada en el contexto de las afirmaciones recientemente formuladas por el ministro ram rez a una revista chilena en las que tild a los trabajadores venezolanos de conservadores y privilegiados o por el cuestionamiento que en d as pasados hizo el presidente ch vez al contrato de los trabajadores de vtv declaraciones en las que ofendi la dignidad de un humilde camar grafo de esa empresa
526547 la reestructuraci n que se est proponiendo persigue colocar de forma m s clara el conjunto de la gesti n y la organizaci n interna de pdvsa al servicio de los acuerdos de empresas mixtas con las transnacionales entre otras cosas busca disminuir el papel de los sindicatos y limitar el derecho a la contrataci n colectiva en aras de la paz social entre trabajadores y patronos por ello las mesas de di logo que fueron una conquista arrancada a la gerencia con la lucha y la movilizaci n de los trabajadores para tratar de resolver sus principales problemas ahora el gobierno las reivindica como suyas y trata de utilizarlas para sustituir a las organizaciones sindicales incluso poniendo en riesgo el derecho a la contrataci n colectiva ya que se pretender a eliminarlo progresivamente y que sea en las mesas de di logo o por normativa interna donde se establecer an las reivindicaciones de los trabajadores y esto no lo decimos en abstracto ya el presidente ch vez cuestion el contrato colectivo de una empresa estatal como vtv lo que significa una violaci n a la autonom a de los sindicatos y un cuestionamiento directo al derecho de los trabajadores a negociar de forma independiente del patrono en este caso el gobierno sus condiciones de trabajo
526548 esto que decimos se puede apreciar con toda nitidez actualmente en el proceso para elegir a la directiva de la futpv en el que el gobierno y la gerencia de pdvsa intervienen de forma grosera pasando por encima de los trabajadores y de la autonom a sindical tratando desesperadamente de unir a por lo menos cuatro sectores de la burocracia roja rojita que hoy se encuentran divididos en torno a prebendas y privilegios que nada tienen que ver con las necesidades de los trabajadores el gobierno trata de unificar a sus cachorros con la esperanza de poner la futpv al servicio de sus planes de reestructuraci n que s lo favorecen a las trasnacionales socias del estado en el negocio petrolero en esto que ch vez llama socialismo del siglo xxi es lo mismo que hacen a nivel nacional creando una central burocr tica construida gracias al manejo discrecional del aparato del estado y encabezada por unos personajes grises completamente an nimos para los trabajadores ya que nunca van a un port n ni se les ve en ninguna lucha bur cratas redomados que pretenden dividir al movimiento sindical y que quieren ser dirigentes sindicales y funcionarios gubernamentales al mismo tiempo es decir se pagan y se dan los vueltos por ello desde nuestra corriente seguimos luchando porque las elecciones en el sector petrolero sean transparentes y democr ticas legitimadas con la participaci n por la base de todos los trabajadores y en ese terreno estamos seguros que derrotaremos a los bur cratas de la iv y de la v
526549 y por otra parte cuando o mos al ministro ram rez hablar de reestructuraci n de pdvsa no podemos dejar de pensar que muy probablemente ese nuevo modelo de gesti n en pdvsa tendr a como objetivo terminar con los supuestos y fantasiosos privilegios que tienen los trabajadores conservadores y acr ticos venezolanos entre ellos el derecho a contratar libremente y a organizarse sindicalmente de forma independiente y aut noma
526550 nosotros s consideramos que debe acometerse un profundo proceso de reestructuraci n de pdvsa pero no creemos que sea el que plantea el gobierno y la gerencia de la empresa y tampoco creemos que esto deba hacerse a trav s de una supercomisi n puedelotodo al margen de los trabajadores e inform ndoles por medio de ocasionales video conferencias en tal sentido hemos venido planteando desde hace varios a os la necesidad de impulsar en el seno de nuestra principal industria una constituyente petrolera democr tica soberana y proporcional en la que participen democr ticamente todos los trabajadores petroleros y en la que se discuta el manejo estrat gico de la renta petrolera su distribuci n y uso el portafolio de negocios el nivel de exportaciones en el marco de los acuerdos internacionales la pol tica de inversiones la utilizaci n de la renta extra por subida s bita de precios as como la gesti n del recurso humano que desde nuestra perspectiva debe ser en el marco del control y gesti n directa de la empresa por parte de los obreros empleados y t cnicos de pdvsa que esta sea 100 estatal y sin empresas mixtas
526551 although we have a present ban this does not prevent ofws from going to iraq
526552 most filipinos are recruited elsewhere and not in the philippines then brought to iraq many transactions are done on the internet and this is very difficult to monitor
526553 definitely we are open we are open and have huge market due to friendly relations with the philippines we welcome filipino professionals to work in iraq
526554 this is reversing the process instead of the people in boracay waiting for the 30 years in order to have titles to their land they can already have titles through free patent under this measure
526555 this measure is to put some order in boracay because right now the reality on this island is that there is no order here everyone can just build everywhere this bill should serve as a road map for the island
526556 this house bill 1109 would only cause conflict in the island and possibly spell death for the tourism industry not only in boracay but also in the whole country because it would send a bad signal to the whole world
526557 imagine after investing so much even millions to improve the island and make it become a premier tourist destination the government would come in and just confiscate it
526558 in this case we have to really fight we really have to safeguard our backyard from the government
526559 we have a pending nullification case before the supreme court against presidential decree 1064 and in case the sc rules in favor of the government we still have the option to push for a bill for the titling of our property there is that option
526560 but house bill 1109 stops all the options available to us the congressman could have waited first before making such move
526561 the court ruled that our vested rights cannot be prejudiced by declaring boracay as forest as the government claims
526562 we firmly believe that what is needed is for the court to confirm our ownership and issue us the title and not the government

526656 the five year contract creates an additional paid holiday iidal fitil a muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of ramadan
526657 the new contract includes eight paid holidays which is the same number provided in the old contract
526658 however the union leadership did request and receive eid al fitr which is apparently spelled various ways including id al fitr and eid ul fitr as a paid holiday in place of labor day
526659 since all team members will still have eight paid holidays the change will not affect production

526670 the overall objective of guaranteeing judicial independence is to ensure a reasonable perception of impartiality judicial independence is but a
526671 to keep the stream of justice clean and pure the judge must be endowed with sterling character impeccable integrity and upright behaviour erosion thereof would undermine the efficacy of the rule of law and the working of the constitution itself the judges of higher echelons therefore should not be mere men of clay with all the frailties and foibles human failings and weak character which may be found in those in other walks of life they should be men of fighting faith with tough fibre not susceptible to any pressure economic political or of any sort the actual as well as the apparent independence of judiciary would be transparent only when the office holders endow those qualities which would operate as impregnable fortress against surreptitious attempts to undermine the independence of the judiciary in short the behaviour of the judge is the bastion for the people to reap the fruits of the democracy liberty and justice and the antithesis rocks the bottom of the rule of law
526672 the societys demand for honesty in a judge is exacting and absolute
526673 judges ordinarily must observe certain rules of decorum in their social behaviour a little isolation and aloofness are the price which one has to pay for being a judge because a judge can never know which case will come before him and who may be concerned in it no hard and fast rule can be laid down in this matter but some discretion must be exercised

526687 my expectations at that time were enormous i knew i had played well enough to win at oakland hills i didnt feel like i had done anything to lose there were a couple of bounces that didnt go my way
526688 i was excited to play in the british open my confidence was as high as at any time in my career nineteen ninety six that was a good year
526689 and i feel it extended beyond that through 1998 maybe 1999 there werent many better
526690 i always admired the way nick faldo hit his irons how precise he was with his game but definitely there were a half dozen years there when i hit it close a lot
526691 i was trying to win the u s open i was going to rip a drive down there hit an 8 iron close make a birdie and be the u s open champion
526692 i couldnt have hit it better the drive was well in the fairway but it kicked into the bunker bad bounce
526693 more wind than ive ever played in for a full four days
526694 overall i was happy with the way i played short game needs work but im hitting it pretty well im looking forward to oakland hills great course great greens
526695 ive played some excellent rounds and a 65 on the course ben hogan called the monster certainly ranks up there
526696 my plan for next year is to play 15 or 16 of the regular events that i enjoy the most and add five or six champions tour events
526697 and then in 2010 my plan is to move full time to the champions tour
526698 no soy yo quien tiene que valorar c mo est n las negociaciones lo nico que puedo decir es que como futbolista no tenemos ninguna duda el resto son detalles del club que est trabajando y hay que ver c mo termina esto y hasta d nde llega
526699 sab amos desde el principio que iba a ser un tema complicado que no iba a ser f cil que un jugador como cristiano llegase al real madrid
526700 si le preguntas a todos los entrenadores todos te dir n que lo quieren es un jugador que todo t cnico quiere tener en su equipo un gran jugador con la exigencia del real madrid de ganar todo cada a o necesita a los mejores
526701 hay un inter s por este jugador pero no s si est firmado no tengo esa informaci n todav a
526702 he hablado con l y sabe perfectamente que es una parte importante de nuestro proyecto es un jugador fundamental no estamos pensando en ning n momento que se puede ir est trabajando hoy ha jugado sus primeros minutos en los que se ha visto lo que es robinho me parece perfecto que muchos est n interesados
526703 personalmente me habr a gustado que jugase en un primera en espa a hab a posibilidades pero hay que aceptar la decisi n del jugador sin duda el futbol ingl s es tambi n una escuela importante para los j venes espero que avance y mejore en muchas cosas
526704 todav a nos cuesta coger un ritmo bueno durante muchos minutos del partido pero tenemos calidad para decidir hay que sufrir ante equipos m s rodados como el hamburgo que en dos semanas empieza su liga y se nota
526705 se le practic un estudio de ultrasonido en lo que son los abductores femorales del lado izquierdo en donde se encontr que el abductor medio nos muestra un sangrado esto nos est mostrando que hay un desgarro y que no es tan s lo una sobredistensi n muscular
526706 estamos hablando de que cuando se presenta una lesi n de esta magnitud y en el sentido como se produce ser al rededor de tres semanas el tiempo en que se pueda recuperar nosotros pronosticamos ese tiempo pero todo va a depender de la evoluci n que vaya presentando el jugador adem s de que conforme vaya pasando el tiempo vamos a continuar con los ex menes y los estudios y tambi n con esto nosotros nos reforzamos para poder dar un alta al jugador
526707 estoy un poco triste por lo que arroj el estudio pero hay que verle el lado positivo a las cosas hay que estar bien lo m s pronto posible y seguir trabajando las cosas se ven an dando bastante bien pero por algo pasan las cosas y ni hablar esto es futbol hay lesiones en todos lados y ahora tengo que verle el lado positivo a las cosas
526708 lo tomamos con tranquilidad porque sab amos que no era algo que lo ten amos que resolver nosotros aunque s quer amos que se tomara una decisi n para la tranquilidad de leo y de todo el equipo ten amos que tener todos una soluci n
526709 sab a bien lo que quer a y si no se vio llegar antes fue porque mi club y la afa me dijeron que me mantuviera al margen creo que hice lo que ten a que hacer
526710 las cosas que hab an salido en la prensa argentina no eran ciertas que yo quer a estar ac con ellos que no pude hacer nada para estar antes y nada m s
526711 hubo mucha repercusi n en este tema especialmente en argentina
526712 es entendible la situaci n de leo que debe de haber sido un poco dif cil
526713 el bar a tiene jugadores y calidad como para sacar cualquier partido adelante sin leo pero bueno tom esa postura de querer retenerlo y despu s ya hubo que recurrir a la fifa y tuvieron que tomar una decisi n

526718 so we squeaked up there really though it was a challenge getting the story together and getting everybody to agree on it indiana jones only becomes complicated when you have another two people saying i want it this way and i want it that way whereas when i first did jones i just said well do it this way and that was much easier but now i have to accommodate everybody because they are all big successful guys too so its a little hard on a practical level if i can come up with another idea that they like well do another really with the last one steven wasnt that enthusiastic i was trying to persuade him but now steve is more amenable to doing another one yet we still have the issues about the direction wed like to take im in the future stevens in the past hes trying to drag it back to the way they were im trying to push it to a whole different place so still we have a sort of tension this recent one came out of that its kind of a hybrid of our own two ideas so well see where we are able to take the next one
526719 in her return we find red sonja a young girl risen from the ashes of tragedy to become the most feared woman warrior of all time the mythical red head blindly seeks vengeance on those who destroyed her family in her path of destruction she discovers a larger purpose for her unearthly powers to save all hyrkania from the villainous kulan gath

526723 wipe that grin off your face with a baseball bat
526724 there was no significant loss of life in those towers not a one
526725 this attack happened in my hometown a hometown i do not live in or work in because of illegal behavior i hope those who swiped my ability to live there enjoy the message they got from god today
526726 in that building existed little more than a bunch of companies which hire
526727 now you know what its like to see your horrors mocked the way mine have been thats not mental illness thats a political message apparently delivered quite brilliantly
526728 there was no significant loss of life in those towers their own evil is
526729 but keep in mind that anyone can block e mail and instant messages and
526730 weare nh audience man to mccain i heard that hershey is moving plants to mexico and ill be damned if im going to eat mexican chocolate
526731 non ho la badante e non sapevo dove lasciare mia madre per cui lho portata con me
526732 desde el arribo del gobierno de evo morales hay un sector de la oposici n que nunca quiso asumir los cambios y que se jug a bloquear el proceso
526733 el gobierno se consolidar y una ca da de un par de prefectos nacionales cambiar a el mapa pol tico
526734 gostei tanto da arbitragem que gostaria de ter sempre um rbitro assim quando jogasse fora de casa a atua o dele foi muito boa
526735 uma coisa a campanha do time outra o empate normal existir uma decep o dos torcedores ap s o jogo esse o momento mais adequado para extern la durante a partida eles foram compreensivos e apoiaram o tempo todo mesmo com os nossos erros em campo
526736 mas acho que ainda muito cedo para pressionar no momento atual a equipe continua bem na tabela da s rie b
526737 foi o jogo em que tivemos mais dificuldades para criar jogadas de gol precisamos trabalhar para voltar normalidade
526738 children have lost touch with the natural world and are unable to identify common animals and plants
526739 the study also found that playing in the countryside was childrens least popular way of spending their spare time and that they would rather see friends or play on their computer than go for a walk or play outdoors
526740 weve probably had 100 people come in asking for the drug in the last couple years
526741 its for animals everything here is for animals we thought they were giving it to their animals
526742 to witness it it looks as peaceful as can be
526743 i usually recommend that they take it with their favourite drink since it has a bitter taste ive never seen anyone finish their whisky or champagne there isnt enough time to give a speech you go to sleep and then you die
526744 i went into the first shop that was advertised as being a vet and i showed the photo and they handed it over
526745 im 78 and my wife is 85 ive got this incurable disease and when four very big policemen came marching up the front steps it was very disconcerting
526746 there is going to be a relaxing of the dress protocols advertisement and people are being encouraged to wear lighter clothing
526747 for me its a great success and not a failure
526748 i was in tears when the captain of the boat with me made me come aboard because i still had plenty of energy left even though id spent 14 5 hours in the water
526749 theres no question i stink im not denying it i do have an odour
526750 if i point to the no smoking sign the passenger will just laugh and keep smoking
526751 my customers would rather starve than not smoke and i would go out of business
526752 in china you cannot drink eat and socialise without a cigarette
526753 if you overprotect your children they dont build their immunity
526754 breathing a little smoke when they are small makes them stronger
526755 cigarettes have an extra value in china that helps improve many social interactions
526756 yes im addicted but so is everyone else at the office
526757 if we didnt smoke i dont know how we would get anything done
526758 id like to think some good may come of what i have gone through and that anyone who thinks they can get away with such behaviour might be forced to think again while anyone who thinks they cant do anything about such treatment might see they dont have to put up with it
526759 with a new man at the top of the sfa and tighter procedures it seems there is a greater willingness to tackle racism
526760 this has hung over me for two years and it is a massive relief that the court proved i was telling the truth all along which the sfa ruling left open to doubt
526761 it has been really unpleasant to have to keep reliving this
526762 it was so weird hearing the verdict delivered and knowing that it was finally all over in that instant and that i could get on with my life it hurt that the sfa judgment let the player and team involved present themselves as the injured parties
526763 they made out as if me and my club spartans were stringing this out so we could be publicity seeking crusaders when all we ever wanted was the truth to be acknowledged
526764 i was twice racially abused by wayne mcintosh that has been proved beyond any doubt
526765 it is now a matter of record that what i have been saying for two years has not been my version of events but what actually happened
526766 for so many people especially in the game it seemed that it was the one topic of conversation when they met me
526767 apart from those at whitehill welfare though everyone in the east of scotland league has been supportive because they know my character and the character of the other person
526768 but it weighed so heavily there have been many occasions when i have asked myself if i would go through it all again if i found myself in the same situation
526769 after much soul searching i have been able to answer yes and im relieved the courts took the action that allowed me to come up with that answer
526770 helpless child sitting unattended unkempt and unwashed in a small stroller in her own urine and faeces
526771 this behaviour indicates that andrea kelly did not merely allow danieal to die she may have even wanted her disabled daughter to die
526772 i am not going to apologise for something for which the ioc is not responsible we are not running the internet in china
526773 let me make it clear the ioc is in favour of the broadest amount of internet access for the media that is the bottom line secondly there has been no deal at any time between the ioc leadership and the games organisers to accept any restrictions
526774 when beijing was awarded the olympic games the ioc promised the media the fullest access to the internet and bocog the organising committee has said it will deliver
526775 instead of investing in the stock market or real estate these people are investing in buying the economic rights to football players
526776 weve been investing 10m a year but that is growing quickly because there are big profits to be made
526777 it is clear that they are not supposed to do that and it goes against the regulations
526778 no club shall enter into a contract which enables any other party to that contract or third party to acquire the ability to influence in employment or transfer related matters its independence its policies or the performance of its teams
526779 there are some irresponsible individuals who just want to make a short term profit
526780 but if it is done properly then it will change football investment will come into brazil
526781 in moral terms government cannot stand aside and watch families being driven into fuel poverty
526782 i urge the prime minister to come out of his bunker and tackle the deflationary forces in the economy action must be taken to resurrect consumer confidence
526783 there is room for manoeuvre in fiscal policy and a substantial economic boost is necessary for example the net borrowing forecast for this year was 43bn the equivalent figure in the last downturn in 1992 93 was 68 2bn
526784 the biggest windfall gainer offshore is the chancellor himself whose oil revenues are heading for 15bn in the current financial year
526785 its time that the snp played their part in supporting under pressure scots co operation is the way forward for scotland not conflict for conflicts sake
526786 salmonds megaphone diplomacy will not make any scottish home warmer or greener
526787 scotland has proved more resistant to financial pressures than other parts of the uk however with deflationary forces becoming stronger by the day scotland is not immune to the economic downturn
526788 molemate is a non invasive rapid and painless mole screening device that enables a medical practitioner to quickly scan your moles showing information up to 2mm under the skin this can assist them in making an instant decision on the health of the mole
526789 we scan the mole for a number of features to see whether it is suspicious or not the scanner measures these pretty accurately and helps with diagnosis
526790 if the patient is worried about a number of moles we would scan them all in the main they are benign but there are some we have to refer on to a specialist
526791 this is an added dimension that helps with clinical assessment if we look at the mole and it is completely fine then we can give that reassurance
526792 there is a scale that we work to from 0 12 anything around six is suspicious
526793 i have always been careful to have them checked out and they have been fine and not suspicious
526794 there are a couple on my leg and neck that i like to keep an eye on
526795 the procedure was quick and easy and very reassuring nothing was found and it gave me the peace of mind i am looking for
526796 they are used a lot in australia which has a big problem with skin cancer and i expect screening like this will become much more popular over here
526797 an experienced gp will be able to give a diagnosis straight away and if in any doubt at all will refer on to a dermatologist
526798 it starts with a wee brown mole and ends up in a coffin
526799 young people have to be aware that skin cancer is not a disease of old people
526800 teenagers those in their early twenties if they see anything on their skin that is different or changing must see a doctor seek help there is no time to delay as in the worst case scenario like alan it can be very fast
526801 tragedy can build into something positive the importance for youngsters to be aware of their bodies and if they see anything tell someone and get it checked
526802 i am not interested in telling my story i wanted them to come out and admit that abuse did go on in scotland but they have never done that what happened to me was decades ago and i still get upset every day
526803 when we talk to each other it helps but nobody would go to a third party and speak about it
526804 the scottish government should lift the time bar and let us get justice but they never will because they know if they did they would be liable for millions of pounds for neglecting children in homes
526805 we were put in cold baths for wetting the bed then the bed sheets were wrapped around us and our pants were put on our heads we were fed porridge and if you couldnt eat it one of the carers would spoon feed you
526806 you would start gagging and they would force you to eat it if you were sick you were made to eat your own vomit as well you would end up on the floor in a heap and they would beat you
526807 this is the last thing we want i have deliberately stayed away because the last thing i want or need is to keep being reminded of my abuse my memories are hard enough to live with
526808 we are carefully considering a scottish truth and reconciliation forum which will give survivors the chance to speak about their experiences and to help come to terms with the past
526809 it will provide an opportunity to establish the facts learn from the suffering and use the experience to help us to protect children in the future
526810 we will consult publicly and with survivors of abuse support organisations and other providers of care on our approach in coming months
526811 we were paying or rather the taxpayer was paying rushdie to protect him
526812 mean nasty tight fisted arrogant and extremely unpleasant in my opinion i am none of those things
526813 the simple fact is that nothing of this sort happened my relationship with my protection team was always cordial certainly entirely professional this kind of absurd behaviour never occurred
526814 there are three references to drinking on duty it is absolutely forbidden for police officers particularly in possession of firearms to drink on duty it is absurd the idea that they would lock me in a cupboard and go to the pub
526815 the idea that i was so unpleasant to them that they locked me up is totally made up
526816 police officers thought if i was incurring costs it would be fair to contribute to that
526817 this is not a free speech issue this is libel
526818 i will not have my character destroyed and presented to the world as something that it is not if they publish it as it is there will be a libel action
526819 we regret that he chooses to publish this book there were a number of passages within the draft that caused us concern following legal advice we negotiated with the publishers to make some alterations
526820 sport websites and publications provide excellent opportunities to broadcast achievements of individuals to the world and to provide a showcase for the activities of gymnasts in some cases however displaying certain information or pictures of children could put them at risk we must all take the time to ensure these photographs are actually suitable for publication
526821 the content of photographs or videos must not depict a child or vulnerable adult in a provocative pose or in a state of partial undress other than when depicting a sporting activity
526822 where relevant a tracksuit may be more appropriate attire children must never be portrayed in a demeaning or tasteless manner common sense should be used when deciding which photographs to print do not use images that can appear staged and potentially provocative do not use images that appear to focus on the groin or in movements when the legs are in a split position
526823 we are certainly not stopping people from taking pictures of their children
526824 we are saying yes you can but you have got to beware about the type of photograph you are taking
526825 everybody loves to see an action shot of gymnastics it is not a problem just as long as the action shot is appropriate
526826 its essential that parents are given clear guidance on the making and use of video and photographic material of all children taking part in activities such as gymnastics these commonsense guidelines should help protect children and provide reassurance to all relevant adults
526827 the internet had added another dimension to fears about inappropriate images appearing of children but it is important that common sense prevails and that parents relatives and children are not robbed of the photographic reminders of special moments in their lives
526828 the assumption that pictures represent a significant threat to children has acquired a fantasy like grotesque character
526829 tragically what the dramatisation and criminalisation of the act of photographing children reveals is a culture that regards virtually every childhood experience from the standpoint of a paedophile the default position is to always expect the worst
526830 we dont have the depth of talent that we had when the likes of myself and yvonne murray were running
526831 it is frustrating to watch runners get praised to high heaven for recording times that are five seconds slower then we were doing 20 years ago
526832 we havent got a lot to shout about just now so we grab on to anything thats going
526833 running has become over technical it has gone away from what the sport is all about to me running is all about hard work and training
526834 there is too much time spent going to psychologists and nutritionists now
526835 what made people run faster 20 years ago was that we went out there and trained hard
526836 all the telltale signs were there they wouldnt run well all year and then all of a sudden when the championships came around their performances would be transformed
526837 there seems to have been a general drop in standards steve jones broke the marathon record in 1985 and the current british competitors are a long way off that time
526838 that said there are some people doing well now and i wouldnt say they were not training hard enough
526839 my son lewis recently broke a scottish schools record that had stood for 31 years so i dont think standards have deteriorated our youngsters train really hard and put in 100 effort its not the case that kids arent committed
526840 we used to supply 11 or 12 vans every summer but now there are only four or five regular vans and they are the ones that do it all year round
526841 the good ones are steady enough if they have got a good established run but its the ones who just do it for the summer that are disappearing they think they are going to make a fortune and its just not true any more
526842 skimmed powder was around 1 400 a ton last year and now its 2 200 a ton some of the suppliers were up to 3 000 at one point
526843 its steadied off now but i dont see it coming down again also sugar is fairly dear as well
526844 a long time ago there used to be about 35 vans around east lothian but its probably less than 10 vans now
526845 i have three vans but im lucky i have also got the caf it accounts for 60 of my sales now without it i would struggle to survive on just the ice cream
526846 ice cream vans are the last dinosaurs of the vans that used to go around the houses and they are about to become extinct
526847 its general talk amongst the traders everyones complaining about prices all we can do is try to find cheaper suppliers everyone has got to buckle down and take the hit
526848 we had a terrible start to this month and that hit everyones sales after a difficult summer last year the last two weeks have been great and thats been a big bonus
526849 but we could do with another six weeks of sun and its looking mixed without the weather we will see more people struggling to get by
526850 im carrying on in the business but my son has given up so im getting rid of his van
526851 if i wasnt so passionate about ice cream i would give up too but ive been in it since i was 15 years old and i love the work
526852 i could name so many people that have been and gone with their ice cream vans in my immediate vicinity
526853 there must be hundreds of people across the country that cant keep it going because theyve come so close to the wire
526854 there will come a time we will have to draw the line when the bills dont get paid its very much a matter of not sinking below that line
526855 today we have consumer habits whether its going to ikea or elsewhere which necessitate that once in a while even those who cant afford cars need to use one and in this sense i think this will complement public transportation
526856 we should be open to this type of initiative knowing that there is not one solution to the problems of transportation and climate change
526857 if its easy to park at autolib stations i would use that
526858 and i would definitely prefer to drive a car that doesnt pollute
526859 its true that not everyone can afford to buy their own car so it could be very useful
526860 when you look at why a politician like david does something its all about those who are pushing him
526861 if you do something like that you basically have to regurgitate the old line about gordon being the best man to lead us through tough times blah blah for david not to even mention brown in the piece was extraordinary
526862 the truth is this you dont do what he did unless youre up to something
526863 by doing what he has done now he has established himself as a player rather than the passive figure he was up till now nobody can now say he hasnt got the balls we knew he had the youth and the charisma he is regarded as a player internationally now he has the politics too to go with it
526864 itll all be about who is lunching with the general secretary of unite and who is sitting next to the head of unison
526865 he is so obvious a successor that gordon cant do it
526866 its going to be like the old days when you had browns leadership speech followed by blairs except now its miliband
526867 think of 1 000 wet raincoats and what they would smell like
526868 and in downmarket areas people may have had a bath once a week if that in a tin bath
526869 its an interesting social history of this tremendous entertainment that everyone went to so often before television it has a lot to do with cinema going which other collections like the film institute dont cover i think its more important being together
526870 there were great bundles of stills lobby cards and posters tied up i asked what was happening to them and i was told that they were waiting to go to the corporation dump
526871 so i came round in my vauxhall and filled it up with these photos there were so many that i couldnt see the back window or side window i think i made a couple of trips
526872 i saw my first film there when i was two snow white and the seven dwarfs i dont remember but my mother wrote it in her diary
526873 there will be a lot of people in this community who are prejudiced against voting for a black man
526874 personally i think its time that someone black became president it shows that anyone can be voted president of this country
526875 historically there has been a lot of tension between the hispanic and african american community it is economic
526876 latinos have recently become the largest minority in the us and they have been taking jobs and political positions that used to be controlled by african americans this has inevitably created political social and economic tensions
526877 it matters that obama is black for some latinos there is suspicion about the african american candidate that is something obama has to deal with that mccain doesnt
526878 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
526879 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
526880 nowadays no one can reach the white house without the latino vote
526881 a decade ago it was enough for a candidate to speak a few words of spanish and say viva mexico or viva cuba this time latino voters are forcing the candidates to give them something in return for their vote
526882 they are concerned about the same issues as the rest of the electorate the economy the war in iraq jobs education housing healthcare
526883 the gap between the two parties is larger now than at any time in 10 years
526884 a lot of latino people around here who are republican are saying its time for change the issues that will decide this election are the same whether you are latino or black
526885 i dont want to spend any more time in any of her majestys holiday camps i wont follow women anymore i know its wrong
526886 i will be vigilant from now on i am never going to give anyone the chance to send me away again i have changed
526887 i dont want people to always say theres barry george he killed jill dando
526888 i want them to say theres barry george he didnt kill jill dando
526889 the police made it up theyre responsible for the gunpowder ive got pictures of police going in my flat with guns thats how it got there
526890 i can hardly believe im a free man at last i am well relieved when they said not guilty i was really shocked
526891 i was shocked that there was any verdict at all at my first trial the jury took five days and i thought it would be next week
526892 i was preparing myself for another weekend in my cell even my legal team was about to leave the court for the day and then we got the phone call to say there was a verdict
526893 his role as leader should be reflected in his attire he plays it safe with suits but his appearance is a statement about the state of his nation from a psychological point of view we can say that his attire could be interpreted as a reflection of a tentative approach towards independence a clear bespoke approach would send out the right messages to the political campfires across europe and indeed the world
526894 if alex salmond was styled in the right way in one of the finest cut and tailored suits that scotland could offer he could really show off what we can do
526895 there are some splendid tailors in savile row who are scottish and in scotland we have beautiful yarns and very fine fabrics
526896 i would give her a bit more of a glamorous image there is a new designer range by scottish cashmere producers johnstons that takes the classic things like twin sets made from cashmere and makes them modern and beautiful she could wear it with funky skirts or even an updated version of a kilt
526897 its not about exterior appearance its about interior morals in this case his stark conservative and classic look is modelled on imminent reason in his world go kenny i think hes got it right
526898 im inclined to think that politicians should be their own people with an individual style and personality
526899 more and more politicians get to parliament with all their ideas and drive and passion and very quickly it gets channelled out
526900 you shouldnt have a pr telling you what to say and do these days everything is about public relations
526901 in terms of being supportive to scotland and scottish fashion thats great but if i was a scottish politician i would go out and find a scottish designer or tailor that i really liked and i would wear something that really suited me
526902 i dont think its a bad idea if people wear scottish designers when they go abroad but at home i think they should be able to wear what they want
526903 until now renting has been a dirty word with people seeing it as money down the drain now mortgage rationing will push us into a more continental approach in which the majority rents
526904 for several months demand for stock has been approximately 40 above our normal monthly average had the properties been available our lettings tally during july would have exceeded 200 this is a phenomenon across the country as every letting agency in scotland is incredibly busy
526905 one of the reasons for the upsurge in demand for unfurnished lettings is that increasing numbers of clients have been or still are home owners with belongings of their own
526906 about 50 of new rental demand now relates to unfurnished properties whereas historically 90 of rental requests had been for furnished flats and houses as a result there is now little or no difference between what it costs to rent a furnished and unfurnished property
526907 we even have successful sellers moving to rented accommodation happy to see the proceeds of the sale earning 6 5 interest they are in no rush to move back to being owner occupiers as they seem to think that prices will fall further before they start to rise again
526908 there are a lot of people looking to rent in the short term while they wait for the market and economic climate to improve weve seen a growing demand for rented accommodation from people who have been advised by estate agents and solicitors to sell their property first before purchasing another
526909 the properties they are demanding are usually unfurnished as the families moving into them already have their own furniture and are looking for somewhere they can settle in the short term before buying a new home of their own
526910 they see renting as less hassle than buying a property while others are put off from moving onto the citys property ladder in the current economic climate
526911 you have to decide either be trampled under hamas shoes or stand in dignity
526912 we are determined to continue the raid until we arrest all those involved
526913 for the leader of msps at holyrood not for the leader in scotland
526914 they are able to state their case while the scottish labour leader has to be more guarded people in westminster and local government need to realise the realities of devolution that hasnt happened
526915 what i would say is that as things currently stand they the holyrood leader leave themselves at a severe disadvantage
526916 lets not forget this vote is for the leader of msps at holyrood not for the leader in scotland
526917 everyone talks about labour mps being london centric nobody talks about the msps being edinburgh centric but that is what they are this is basically about creating an snp mark two
526918 it is madness to say that they have to have a dividing line with london labour this kind of thing drove henry mcleish and it drove jack and it has got us precisely nowhere we need someone to change the record
526919 his position is that it doesnt matter about the name of the job the person who wins this contest will have a mandate
526920 that is what you are going to get from going to the entire electoral college the scottish labour leader at holyrood will be a distinctive scottish voice
526921 this is a classic turf war labour politicians in both parliaments are so preoccupied with having power they are rapidly losing it
526922 the determination and strong purpose shown by gordon are why he will lead us into the next election and win the confidence of the country all of us are focused on that
526923 when you face these kinds of global problems you need as prime minister someone who is respected on the international stage and someone whose hard work and ability over the last 11 years has made britain better off
526924 we do not want a summer of leadership speculation we have got a good case to make and we should get out there and make it all of this leadership speculation gets in the way of us putting our message across
526925 we will make a fatal error by not giving gordon a chance to roll out his plans yes he is a serious bloke dare i say he may come over a bit boring hes not a trained actor hes a deep thinker let me tell you this fellow is no mug
526926 in moral terms government cannot stand aside and watch families being driven into fuel poverty
526927 i urge the prime minister to come out of his bunker and tackle the deflationary forces in the economy action must be taken to resurrect consumer confidence
526928 the fringe society were warned well in advance about the computer system it is something that people have been talking about and raising concerns about for many months now
526929 they were most certainly told that bringing in a new computer system so late in the day was a real gamble we were only told in february
526930 we have been kept in the dark about the gravity of the situation and the depth of the problems that existed the fact that this needless situation has been allowed to develop has very badly damaged my faith in the fringe society
526931 we have not had a box office since june and we only managed to process our first ticket a few days ago we are very very out of pocket
526932 we have spent well over 100 000 in getting the venue up and running and there has been no box office revenue coming in we have been literally working through the night to get this mess sorted and our box office manager didnt go to bed for three or four nights
526933 the whole ticket fiasco has been very annoying my understanding is that the venues warned the fringe box office that the software that they were using was not going to be up and running on time
526934 ive been left flabbergasted by the fact that they went ahead anyway and tried to use this system without any practice
526935 i think this will damage the fringe as an organisation i think what may very well happen is that in future big venues like the underbelly pleasance assembly and gilded balloon will just sell all their own tickets and not rely on the fringe any more
526936 people paid 5 to see my preview show but 155 of them will now have to pay extra to see a show where the price is 15
526937 the fringe messed up and they should pay the difference and book people in for another show but they wont do it there needs to be an investigation after the festival to find out exactly what has gone wrong
526938 i would love to be a fly on the wall at the first meeting of the fringe board after the festival there will be fireworks that is for sure it will be interesting to see who if anyone is held to account for this mess
526939 it was blindingly obvious that debuting an untried software system just before the festival was a potential recipe for disaster and we made our feelings known
526940 the fringe set up has been a mess and we should have been ringing alarm bells a month ago
526941 whenever you introduce a new software system there are inevitably problems it is probably the most complex ticketing system in the world im very grateful that we are now up and running but if we had opened any earlier we would have been in big trouble
526942 what we are interested in is the quality of the audience experience we dont comment on individual organisations
526943 given the size of the project it makes no sense whatsoever to still be in an experimental stage just weeks before the tickets went on sale
526944 when you launch a new computer system something inevitably goes wrong and you must be prepared for that
526945 there is an economic downturn affecting the whole of the uk and edinburgh is no exception
526946 encourage the police to arrest more people for drunken anti social behaviour
526947 the snp is punishing all consumers for the problems caused by a minority and voters know it
526948 scottish shoppers resent the prospect of the scottish government pushing up alcohol prices and restricting how and when alcohol can be sold
526949 clearly worded to elicit responses which reflect the interests of the wsta itself
526950 we would welcome any constructive suggestions on how we can tackle alcohol misuse
526951 i think some excellent books are on the longlist but i cannot respect a judging committee that decides to pick a book like tom rob smiths child 44 a fairly well written and well paced thriller that is no more than that over novels as exceptional as helen garners the spare room or ross raisins gods country
526952 i will declare my bias as the publisher at canongate i had a vested interest in seeing the spare room make the shortlist but from an objective point of view this novel has been as well reviewed as any book we have ever published
526953 anyone of whom i would respect as a judge of serious fiction more than all five of these judges put together
526954 one has to be philosophical about these things and as a publisher you come to realise what a lottery these prizes are i am certain that the spare room is a modern classic that will continue to be read and enjoyed and appreciated long after all of us are dead
526955 i cant possibly comment on a competition that it still alive other than to say that i wish that we were celebrating the 13 authors that were longlisted for their achievements
526956 there have been e mail exchanges where he byng claimed that we had not even read the books
526957 i put myself under considerable pressure making sure i got every single book read and making a decision that felt impossible
526958 i really do not appreciate being undermined in this way
526959 it validates what most of us who read contemporary crime fiction already know which is that the genre has transformed itself to a point where the best of its output can stand shoulder to shoulder with any other novels
526960 we have been waiting for years for a thriller to appear on the list it is totally deserved though i am surprised because while it is an excellent thriller it is not a particularly literary book
526961 ben remains critically ill he has not required sedative drugs at any time over the last 24 hours yet remains in a coma
526962 if ben remains in a coma once the stabilising measures that are dealing with blood chemistry and temperature are completed it is likely we will proceed to brain stem testing
526963 the team which will include one officer from south wales police will support the local senior investigating officers and have been sent following a request from the antiguan authorities received through the foreign and commonwealth office
526964 he put his life on the line for other people all through his career i want his family to know that i will be teaching my son about modern day heroes like him
526965 the iraqi government broke their branches and took down their tree
526966 they used to come and order us to give them 100 gas canisters
526967 they used to brag that they were in the mahdi army now they are afraid to say it out loud
526968 the sadr office used to be the soul of the militia
526969 you still get punished if you talk bad about them
526970 the main motive is to exclude the sadr movement from politics
526971 not since bobby charlton fought arthur scargill over a comb has there been advertisement a more futile contest
526972 the person who would close an eye to centuries of labour struggle to improve the quality of life for all
526973 i have to say i think the leader in scotland needs to have a much wider voice a much more influential voice and a much stronger voice thats what i intend to say during the campaign
526974 there was a cabinet meeting when jack had to make a phone call to brown to check that everything was ok you cant carry on having that kind of thing happening
526975 you always get the impression from mps that in terms of policy they are the top dogs so if gordon brown appoints des browne then he is the top dog in scotland the job cannot be seen as secondary in importance the leader in the scottish parliament has to be primary
526976 it is madness for andy to have to have a dividing line with london labour this kind of thing drove henry mcleish and it drove jack and it has got us precisely nowhere we need someone to change the record
526977 we would just be moving towards an snp mark 2 if that is andys position then a lot of people will be thinking twice about giving him their support
526978 its an odd strategy to say that i will take on salmond by launching an attack on my own party
526979 i dont think its for me or other mps to offer backing
526980 lets not forget this vote is for the leader of msps at holyrood not for the leader in scotland
526981 the thing about cathy is that she knows how to tickle the partys erogenous zone
526982 this is the minister who backed privatisation at every step now she is left wing after all
526983 if any of these three went into their local tesco youd have to wonder whether anyone would know who they were
526984 there have been reports of adverse reactions in those who have ingested food containing large quantities of msg
526985 most individuals are unaffected by ingesting msg but for those affected the reaction can be extremely distressing
526986 despite previous work aimed at reducing levels of msg in prepared meals from chinese takeaways there still appeared to be use of the additive at levels above the limit prescribed in law
526987 the continued failure of a significant number of samples of chinese style meals to comply with the msg limit is disappointing
526988 the sample results suggest that many types of food can fail the standard and that the problem may be particular outlets rather than food types
526989 if you use fresh vegetables and lean meat then the flavour does not need enhancing so you do not need to use msg
526990 said i handled his biz and im one of his favorite rappers well give luda a special pardon if im ever in the slammer better yet put him in office make me your vice president hillary hated on you so that b amp is irrelevant

526995 iit gandhinagar has been chosen by many students the merit list in mumbais chemical engineering branch closed at 4 300 rank while gandhinagar has gone beyond this number
526996 we get very few sc st students and rarely do these seats fill up but all students who get admissions in these categories will be put in preparation courses to cope with the rest next year onwards
526997 girls here dont like to marry men from india as they find them too traditional and girls in india dont wish to move to the us as they are well qualified and have good careers generally people find someone when still in college but if they dont it is hard to find someone or meet the right people when you are working hard at your job here they get to meet around 150 girls over two days
526998 for those who havent found someone we are telling them this is also a way and we are making it easier by bringing similar people together
526999 all this means that the marriage life will be longer
527000 it appears that the earlier view by this court had not been brought to the notice of the court when the subsequent decision was rendered this resulted into two conflicting views on the same issue
527001 i thought the house was fine i liked the house my wife was the one who didnt really like it
527002 she spends more time in the house so one she likes is important to her i dont really care
527003 man if i had that place no one could make me leave
527004 bouna looked even better than usual too he had a few stops that single handedly saved the tie
527005 you have to give a coach at least four years and most likely five so he can prove what he can do with his players and firing a coach after three years is crazy
527006 were k state dammit we should be winning 10 games and challenging for the big 12 north every year and if prince cant do that now then get someone in here preferably jim leavitt

527014 for years i used to tell people not to choose frames with thick arms because if youre reversing your car youll have a blind spot
527015 over the past 15 years ive kept every single frame weve carried its all in boxes and im trying to find the best way to display them
527016 who would have thought harry potter would have brought them back into fashion
527017 what we like is where the optics model is similar to the uks
527018 in italy or france or germany most people would go to an eye doctor to get tested then go around the corner to buy their glasses we prefer to have a fully qualified optometrist on the premises owning that practice and both testing and dispensing
527019 our typical customer has a very similar profile to an asda customer
527020 we managed to hold prices for 10 years but six months ago we could see people starting to think ive only got so much money in my purse
527021 before that you could not advertise not even an announcement in the local paper for a new shop opening you couldnt put frames in the window with prices on them
527022 you wouldnt believe the things people will tell you if youre just sitting next to them

527027 if commodity prices fall people will be unwilling to bear higher tax rates from cities to maintain unprofitable recycling programmes
527028 clearly the impact of the credit crunch and the knock on to the capital markets has to be taken into consideration market sentiment would have to improve from current levels to ipo

527040 there will now be pressure from central banks to take the big red pencil to dividends
527041 i think were on the way into recession and well see mortgage losses greater than in the early 1990s
527042 its more likely than not consumers are going to get hit hard by a combination of the housing market downturn and inflation
527043 we see growth falling from 2 per cent this year to flat next year and companies will see their profits fall sharply and wont be able to borrow
527044 unemployment is a lagging indicator and will take some time
527045 we need to see asset prices stabilise and the reopening of the securitisation markets for banks but even then its going to take time to feed through to the consumer
527046 how quickly we get out depends on whether the government puts in place a package to stimulate the economy and cut interest rates
527047 we will start the campaign in beijing next week and we will use the games as a catalyst to get chinese companies over

527054 after 9 11 itself the anthrax attacks were probably the most consequential event of the bush presidency one could make a persuasive case that they were actually more consequential
527055 there cant be any question that this extremely flamboyant though totally false linkage between iraq and the anthrax attacks played a very significant role in how americans perceived of the islamic threat generally and iraq specifically

527149 nooit was er dus een tijd waarop gij i e god niets gemaakt hadt omdat gij de tijd zelf gemaakt hadt en geen tijden zijn met u in eeuwigheid want gij blijft maar indien zij bleven zouden het geen tijden zijn want wat is tijd wie zou dat gemakkelijk en in het kort kunnen uitleggen wie zo dit zelfs door nadenken voldoende begrijpen om er zich in woorden over te kunnen uitlaten en toch waarvan maken wij in spreken melding dat ons meer vertrouwd en bekend is dan de tijd en zonder twijfel begrijpen wij het wanneer wij daarover spreken en ook begrijpen wij het wanneer wij een ander erover horen spreken wat is dan de tijd wanneer niemand mij het vraagt weet ik het wanneer ik het iemand op zich vraag zou willen uitleggen weet ik het niet toch zeg ik vol vertrouwen dat ik weet dat indien niets voorbijging er geen verleden tijd zou zijn en indien niets op komst was er geen toekomstige tijd zou zijn en indien niets was er geen tegenwoordige tijd zou zijn hoe kunnen er dan die twee tijden zijn de verledene en de toekomstige daar aan de ene kant het verleden er niet meer is en aan de andere kant het toekomstige er nog niet is maar indien het tegenwooridge altijd tegenwoordig zou zijn en niet in het verleden overging zou er geen tijd meer zijn maar eeuwigheid indien het tegenwoordige daardoor tot tijd wordt dat het in het verledene overgaat hoe kunnen wij dan zeggen dat ook dit er is welks bestaan zijn oorzaak alleen daarin vindt dat het niet meer zal zijn zodat we in waarheid zeggen dat het tegenwoordige tijd is alleen omdat het ernaar streeft niet te zijn
527150 dit boek vindt zijn geboorteplaats in een tekst van borges in de lach die bij het lezen van die tekst alles waar het denken namelijk ns denken zoals dat bij onze tijd en bij ons aardrijkskundig besef behoort mee vertrouwd is dooreenschudt want die lach ondermijnt alle geordende oppervlakken en alle schemas die voor ons het gewemel der levende wezenstot rust brengen en ons duizend jaar oude omgaan met de begrippen het zelfde en het andere wordt er voor lange tijd door aan het wankelen gebracht en verontrust de bedoelde tekst citeert een zekere chinese encyclopedie waarin geschreven staat dat de dieren kunnen worden verdeeld in a die de keizer toebehoren b gebalsemde c tamme d speenvarkens e sirenen f fabeldieren g loslopende honden h die in deze indeling voorkomen i die in het rond slaan als gekken j ontelbare k die met een fijn kameelharen penseeltje getekend zijn l et caetera m die juist een kruik gebroken hebben n die uit de verte op vliegen lijken bij de verbazing over deze taxonomie bereiken we in n sprong wat ons dank zij deze fabuleuze opsomming als exotische betovering van een ander soort denken wordt opgedist namelijk de grens van ons eigen denken
527151 het is weliswaar zeer prijzenswaardig naar de populaire begrippen af te dalen wanneer de verheffing tot de principes van de zuivere rede revoren heeft plaatsgevonden en tot volle bevrediging is geslaagd en dat zou betekenen de leer van de zeden tevoren op een metafysica te funderen maar haar dan waneer zij vaststaat daarna door de populariteit ingang te doen vinden maar het is uiterst ongerijmd daaraan reeds tegemoet te willen komen in het eerste onderzoek waarvan heel de juistheid van de beginselen afhangt niet alleen dat deze werkwijze nooit aanspraak kan maken op de hoogst zeldzame verdienste van een ware filosofische populariteit want het is immers helemaal geen kunst algemeen begrijpelijk te zijn wanneer men daarbij van elk grondig inzicht afstand doet maar het brengt een stuitende mengeling van opgelapte waarnemingen en quasi spitsvondige principes te voorschijn waaraan onnozele halzen zich laven omdat het toch zeer bruikbaar is voor het alledaagse geklets terwijl verstandige mensen verwarring voelen en omdat zij zichzelf toch niet kunnen helpen ontevreden hun ogen afwenden hoewel filosofen die deze begoocheling zeer goed doorzien weinig gehoor vinden wanneer zij vragen voor enige tijd de geveinsde populariteit te verlaten om pas met recht populair te mogen zijn na het verwerven van bepaald inzicht
527152 boven de atlantische oceaan bevond zich een barometrisch minimum het trok oostwaarts in de richting van een boven rusland gelegen maximum en vertoonde nog niet de neiging hiervoor naar het noorden uit te wijken de isothermen en isotheren vervulden hun plicht de luchttemperatuur stond in de voorgeschreven verhouding tot de gemiddelde jaartemperatuur tot de temperatuur van zowel de koudste als de warmste maand en tot de aperiodische maandelijkse temperatuurschommeling de opkomst en ondergang van de zon van de maan de lichtvariaties van de maan van venus van de ring van saturnus en vele andere gewichtige verschijnselen stemden overeen met de voorspellingen daaromtrent in de astronomische jaarboeken de waterdamp in de lucht had zijn hoogste spankracht en de luchtvochtigheid was gering in n woord dat de feitelijk situatie heel aardig weergeeft ook al is het wat ouderwets het was een mooie augustusdag in het jaar 1913
527153 in de griekse mythologie was er een figuur genaamd sisyphus
527154 je vraagt n zoon la us dien zul je krijgen maar weet dat je door de hand van je eigen kind zult omkomen want zeus verhoorde de vervloeking van pelops wiens zoon chrysippus door jou op de neme sche spelen werd ontvoerd
527155 welk wezen loopt s morgens op vier s middags op twee en s avonds op drie voeten maar hoe meer voeten het gebruikt des te kleiner is zijn kracht en snelheid
527156 want in den morgen van zn leven kruipt hij op handen en voeten heeft hij als man den middag van het leven bereikt dan gaat hij met opgeheven hoofd en in fiere houding als grijsaard in den avond van het leven moet n stuttend stokje hem tot derde been dienen
527157 gruwzaam is de kennis die slechts onheil brengt over den wetende laat mij heengaan koning
527158 zelf ben je de schuld van de ellende die de stad getroffen heeft
527159 well i was jacking off on the couch i wonder if they saw me through the window
527160 just walk away from this random girl dont do anything stupid you can just go home and masturbate for five minutes and you will be happy you didnt take her home make a mistake and commit to 12 hours of time spent with her
527161 alex es ist ein jahr vergangen es sind bald sommerferien und ich w rde gerne am day camp teilnehmen
527162 now it is a matter of avoiding future wound healing disorders infections strong side effects caused by the drugs and in particular any rejective reaction
527163 its kind of like being date raped which i like
527164 if he wants to retract that it would be nice for the 9 000 people who have been drug raped in the past 12 years it shows a total lack of understanding and compassion for the issues i hope everyone boycotts everything he does now
527165 if i die what a beautiful death to die in the exercise of your passion
527166 one half millimetre of mistake one quarter second of inattention and you lose your life
527167 this pay cut is being imposed by directors who have to take ultimate responsibility for the ofcom fine when these directors take a 10 pay cut then maybe some of us will be more willing to agree to belt tightening
527168 there will be very tough contract negotiations we have not got enough money and we are facing huge rises in our fuel bills when contracts come up for renewal they will have to agree to 10 cuts at least 10
527169 we were paying or rather the taxpayer was paying rushdie to protect him
527170 mean nasty tight fisted arrogant and extremely unpleasant in my opinion i am none of those things
527171 the simple fact is that nothing of this sort happened my relationship with my protection team was always cordial certainly entirely professional this kind of absurd behaviour never occurred
527172 there are three references to drinking on duty it is absolutely forbidden for police officers particularly in possession of firearms to drink on duty it is absurd the idea that they would lock me in a cupboard and go to the pub
527173 the idea that i was so unpleasant to them that they locked me up is totally made up
527174 police officers thought if i was incurring costs it would be fair to contribute to that
527175 this is not a free speech issue this is libel
527176 i will not have my character destroyed and presented to the world as something that it is not if they publish it as it is there will be a libel action
527177 we regret that he chooses to publish this book there were a number of passages within the draft that caused us concern following legal advice we negotiated with the publishers to make some alterations
527178 but not going to university did give me an incredible driving force because it leaves you with a slight chip on your shoulder it makes me feel i am going to read absolutely everything so i can prove that i am not stupid
527179 according to vietnamese law glitter will be freed on august 19 the decision on his release will be read before him that day it will be signed by the director of the prison
527180 where it is known that a sex offender convicted in another country is to be deported to the uk he is met at the port of entry by the police who interview him and pass any relevant information to the police in the area to which the offender is proposing to live
527181 offenders convicted of sexual offences whether in the uk or overseas may be monitored
527182 why hades has hair made of fire and zeus doesnt have hair made of a thunder bolt
527183 yelled at kate my older sister last night and i really hurt her feelings
527184 i think my overall reaction is that its really sad that in 2008 i have people watching every single move i make
527185 when theres a big game between the cubs and brewers going on its sad that thats what their focus is on and the last thing i had heard is that when you want to do a story on someone you contact them
527186 so berf llte bahnh fe gibt s bei uns daheim nicht
527187 you didnt make the cut im still the bigger slut
527188 he who is offended when offense is not intended is a fool he who is offended when offense is intended is a greater fool
527189 thats what i would have done at the time i used to program at home based on various tutorials found in linux magazines im a grown up now i should investigate these fancy ws stuff that promise wonders
527190 public comment received by the department indicates a growing concern among hunters landowners outfitters and local businesses that economic factors are increasingly affecting hunting habits or will affect them in the future
527191 the department therefore made the decision to leave the traditional season structure in place for the current year while launching an outreach effort to determine if the traditional and historic dove season structure should be altered for future seasons
527192 a recurrent theme was the concern that increased consumer costs particularly transportation costs related to energy prices make anything less than a three day opening weekend economically unjustifiable
527193 similarly proponents of the 60 day 15 bird configuration stated that economic considerations would cause them to curtail the number of times they could go hunting leading them to prefer a higher daily bag limit in the past hunters and others have expressed an aversion to delaying the opening day until the first full weekend preferring the earliest possible opener
527194 my mom says that airbags kill more people than they save
527195 my mom says that she is too busy with work to have my friends over to my house for playdates
527196 my mom says that when i leave she sits in my room and cries because she misses me so much
527197 if i cut my long hair my mom will cry because she is the one who likes it long i want it short but she doesnt like it like that
527198 playing halo on the xbox 360 is about as enjoyable as using shards of broken glass for lubricant as you masturbate non stop for 15 hours over a recently aborted foetus covered in barbeque sauce or having your eyes forced open as you watch a group of white buddhists stamp on your mothers face
527199 gaining complete social acceptance for gay marriages will be as easy as making the peak of mount everest wheelchair accessible however this mount everest will be a 29 029ft high sheer wall covered in teflon and indestructable monsters that eat spastics and the wheelchairs in question have square wheels and disintegrate when taken above a height of 8 meters
527200 when i came to this country i would tell silent stories i would tell them to people who had wronged me if someone cut in front of me in line ignored me bumped me or pushed me i would glare at them staring silently hissing a story to them when i was finished talking to that person i would continue my stories talking to the air the sky to all the people of the world and whoever might be listening in heaven it is wrong to say that i used to tell these stories i still do and not only to those i feel have wronged me the stories emanate from me all the time i am awake and breathing and i want everyone to hear them written words are rare in small villages like mine and it is my right and obligation to send my stories into the world even if silently even if utterly powerless
527201 his temper would place this country at risk in international affairs and the world perhaps in danger in my mind it should disqualify him
527202 couldnt persuade you he was going at least to needle you or sometimes belittle you or blow up into trying to have you believe you were beneath him so that youd be less likely to challenge him he needed to be the top guy
527203 for me some of this stuff is relevant it raises questions about stability its more than just temper its this need of his to show you that hes above you a sneering condescending attitude its hurt his relationships in congress ive seen it up close
527204 there are sometimes calculated displays of temper which is what lyndon johnson used to persuade people
527205 but sometimes somebodys temperament can get in the way of aides telling him the truth which happened during the vietnam war with lbj his temper scared some aides away which was not good for anyone thats always part of the risk with a strong temper and so its always relevant
527206 foster said he bunted at him and i just wanted him to check and see
527207 span got hit with a ball and i didnt think he bunted at him but marty was right to throw me out you cant argue balls and strikes
527208 i knew gardy was going to throw his hat eventually
527209 thats his go to move he usually doesnt kick it that was kind of entertaining
527210 ummm just so you know instructional scenes dont work in improv
527211 i have a quibble with you you shouldnt put your hand behind your partners neck when you swing dance you should put it on their arm you really messed that up last week and i wanted to tell you now
527212 hey i have a suggestion that will make you a much better dancer
527213 oh i keep forgetting that most of this group doesnt have jobs some of us work
527214 well we need to do the submarine form in such a way that the characters dont cross the space and interact with other groups of characters because that was the note noah gave and we havent been doing that so thats why i dont think the shows are good
527215 no not at all i am all i need ha ha ha
527216 insulto a la justicia y de afrenta a las v ctimas de eta
527217 s lo puedo tener una opini n se tiene que respetar la ley
527218 este individuo a todos los ciudadanos y por supuesto al presidente del gobierno le genera una sensaci n perfectamente entendible de desprecio
527219 mediante este sistema podemos obtener agua potable a partir de aguas negras
527220 el machismo impera especialmente en los pa ses en desarrollo
527221 abrir los espacios de participaci n a las personas e informar adecuadamente
527222 tenemos una situaci n cultural bastante machista hay muchos temas que son tab que no se plantean abiertamente como la sexualidad
527223 los hombres deben alzar la voz a favor de los temas que levanta la coalici n
527224 la feminizaci n est sucediendo y uno de los principales obst culos para reducirla es el estigma y la discriminaci n
527225 los seres humanos que discriminamos a las personas que viven con vih sean mujeres hombres o ni os somos los que contribuimos a perpetuar que la epidemia no se detenga
527226 the city was recruiting volunteer firefighters and i was attracted to that
527227 i felt i should give something back to the community
527228 not too long after becoming a volunteer firefighter i fell in love with it in 1973
527229 as a child i wanted to grow up to be a farmer
527230 my family owned a 160 acre farm five miles from frisco which we tended until my fathers health deteriorated and mom who taught school leased it to other farmers
527231 i was a volunteer firefighter in frisco on the days that i didnt work in mckinney
527232 its fairly typical for small towns to have a firefighter covering two posts
527233 at that time frisco did not have a city manager so the mayor was much more involved in the day to day decisions of the city
527234 as a city administrator i was paid to assist with details in any way i could
527235 the job would almost equate to a department head in the city today
527236 we are fortunate to have a community that sets high standards and has very high expectations
527237 the staff at city hall follows those guidelines and i believe that sets the personality of the entire city
527238 maybe its a combination of dedication innovativeness and an interest in exploring new ideas that makes them quality firefighters
527239 we have incentive pay for paramedic certification and we are fortunate that the city encourages degrees through tuition reimbursement and education pay
527240 many who do not have degrees are in college classes right now
527241 we have a number of staff members with masters degrees in business management
527242 in our case the quicker we get to a fire or accident the better
527243 public safety officers in any field are accountable for providing professional and efficient services in emergencies
527244 peace of mind has value and i think that we convey that to folks
527245 a short while back we had a fire at a manufacturing company where chemicals were involved and our firefighters were there all day doing what was expected of them
527246 i like the fact that we dont mind being human with our community
527247 i told you for 11 years i dont reveal my vote
527248 so im going to excite you at the end we do not discuss preseason polls with our players or coaches preseason polls are tough
527249 nos sentimos bien las condiciones clim ticas no son muy distintas a lo que estuvimos sintiendo en corea del sur y ya esper bamos esto estamos tomando todo con calma prepar ndonos lo mejor posible y ajustando los ltimos detalles
527250 nos sirvi mucho porque nos permiti aclimatarnos a lo que estamos sintiendo aqu en beijing el nervio siempre est en todas las competencias pero estos juegos pienso disfrutarlos demasiado me siento muy bien las instalaciones est n en perfecto estado y estoy lista
527251 we have a problem with processing these returns it takes someone with tax background
527252 the first truly open and comprehensive platform for mobile devices
527253 i dont think theres anything that would preclude us from working together how we cooperate thats the question
527254 are a rattly ship where theres no control over where these platforms are going
527255 the problem right now is there are too many open source players
527256 it doesnt make sense in a marketplace to have multiple vendors doing the same thing if you combine all that effort into one you should have a lot more effect
527257 more feasible for android to merge with limo than with symbian because the technology underpinnings are the same
527258 there are clear competitive reasons why nokia which owns all the intellectual property and will be the biggest contributor to the open source symbian foundation has no commercial incentive at all to work with google
527259 this is really nothing new weve seen linux consortiums come and go
527260 in the future being a developer on someones platform will mean being hosted on their infrastructure
527261 a key test of whether an api is open is whether it is used to enable services that are not hosted by the api provider
527262 when you are ignorant of the enemy but know yourself your chances of winning or losing are equal
527263 lets program em with all kinds of self oriented survival instincts limit their intellect wire pain and fear and lust signals directly to the central control circuits of their brain then make them overcome all those natural tendencies for surviving a few years on earth if they want their soul to survive for eternity
527264 why do you have the pens tied to the table
527265 make no mistake the mobile is the trouser of our times and thus becomes the lightning rod for class tensions petty jealousies and accumulated frustrations of an elite that sees the last vestiges of control slipping away
527266 it was a difficult intimidating thing for me to do but lets just say it was an interesting experience and the nudity wasnt gratuitous
527267 there have been reports of adverse reactions in those who have ingested food containing large quantities of msg
527268 most individuals are unaffected by ingesting msg but for those affected the reaction can be extremely distressing
527269 despite previous work aimed at reducing levels of msg in prepared meals from chinese takeaways there still appeared to be use of the additive at levels above the limit prescribed in law
527270 the continued failure of a significant number of samples of chinese style meals to comply with the msg limit is disappointing
527271 the sample results suggest that many types of food can fail the standard and that the problem may be particular outlets rather than food types
527272 if you use fresh vegetables and lean meat then the flavour does not need enhancing so you do not need to use msg
527273 sport websites and publications provide excellent opportunities to broadcast achievements of individuals to the world and to provide a showcase for the activities of gymnasts in some cases however displaying certain information or pictures of children could put them at risk we must all take the time to ensure these photographs are actually suitable for publication
527274 the content of photographs or videos must not depict a child or vulnerable adult in a provocative pose or in a state of partial undress other than when depicting a sporting activity
527275 where relevant a tracksuit may be more appropriate attire children must never be portrayed in a demeaning or tasteless manner common sense should be used when deciding which photographs to print do not use images that can appear staged and potentially provocative do not use images that appear to focus on the groin or in movements when the legs are in a split position
527276 we are certainly not stopping people from taking pictures of their children
527277 we are saying yes you can but you have got to beware about the type of photograph you are taking
527278 everybody loves to see an action shot of gymnastics it is not a problem just as long as the action shot is appropriate
527279 its essential that parents are given clear guidance on the making and use of video and photographic material of all children taking part in activities such as gymnastics these commonsense guidelines should help protect children and provide reassurance to all relevant adults
527280 the internet had added another dimension to fears about inappropriate images appearing of children but it is important that common sense prevails and that parents relatives and children are not robbed of the photographic reminders of special moments in their lives
527281 the assumption that pictures represent a significant threat to children has acquired a fantasy like grotesque character
527282 tragically what the dramatisation and criminalisation of the act of photographing children reveals is a culture that regards virtually every childhood experience from the standpoint of a paedophile the default position is to always expect the worst
527283 molemate is a non invasive rapid and painless mole screening device that enables a medical practitioner to quickly scan your moles showing information up to 2mm under the skin this can assist them in making an instant decision on the health of the mole
527284 we scan the mole for a number of features to see whether it is suspicious or not the scanner measures these pretty accurately and helps with diagnosis
527285 if the patient is worried about a number of moles we would scan them all in the main they are benign but there are some we have to refer on to a specialist
527286 this is an added dimension that helps with clinical assessment if we look at the mole and it is completely fine then we can give that reassurance
527287 there is a scale that we work to from 0 12 anything around six is suspicious
527288 i have always been careful to have them checked out and they have been fine and not suspicious
527289 there are a couple on my leg and neck that i like to keep an eye on
527290 the procedure was quick and easy and very reassuring nothing was found and it gave me the peace of mind i am looking for
527291 they are used a lot in australia which has a big problem with skin cancer and i expect screening like this will become much more popular over here
527292 an experienced gp will be able to give a diagnosis straight away and if in any doubt at all will refer on to a dermatologist
527293 it starts with a wee brown mole and ends up in a coffin
527294 young people have to be aware that skin cancer is not a disease of old people
527295 teenagers those in their early twenties if they see anything on their skin that is different or changing must see a doctor seek help there is no time to delay as in the worst case scenario like alan it can be very fast
527296 tragedy can build into something positive the importance for youngsters to be aware of their bodies and if they see anything tell someone and get it checked
527297 the fringe society were warned well in advance about the computer system it is something that people have been talking about and raising concerns about for many months now
527298 they were most certainly told that bringing in a new computer system so late in the day was a real gamble we were only told in february
527299 we have been kept in the dark about the gravity of the situation and the depth of the problems that existed the fact that this needless situation has been allowed to develop has very badly damaged my faith in the fringe society
527300 we have not had a box office since june and we only managed to process our first ticket a few days ago we are very very out of pocket
527301 we have spent well over 100 000 in getting the venue up and running and there has been no box office revenue coming in we have been literally working through the night to get this mess sorted and our box office manager didnt go to bed for three or four nights
527302 the whole ticket fiasco has been very annoying my understanding is that the venues warned the fringe box office that the software that they were using was not going to be up and running on time
527303 ive been left flabbergasted by the fact that they went ahead anyway and tried to use this system without any practice
527304 i think this will damage the fringe as an organisation i think what may very well happen is that in future big venues like the underbelly pleasance assembly and gilded balloon will just sell all their own tickets and not rely on the fringe any more
527305 people paid 5 to see my preview show but 155 of them will now have to pay extra to see a show where the price is 15
527306 the fringe messed up and they should pay the difference and book people in for another show but they wont do it there needs to be an investigation after the festival to find out exactly what has gone wrong
527307 i would love to be a fly on the wall at the first meeting of the fringe board after the festival there will be fireworks that is for sure it will be interesting to see who if anyone is held to account for this mess
527308 it was blindingly obvious that debuting an untried software system just before the festival was a potential recipe for disaster and we made our feelings known
527309 the fringe set up has been a mess and we should have been ringing alarm bells a month ago
527310 whenever you introduce a new software system there are inevitably problems it is probably the most complex ticketing system in the world im very grateful that we are now up and running but if we had opened any earlier we would have been in big trouble
527311 what we are interested in is the quality of the audience experience we dont comment on individual organisations
527312 given the size of the project it makes no sense whatsoever to still be in an experimental stage just weeks before the tickets went on sale
527313 when you launch a new computer system something inevitably goes wrong and you must be prepared for that
527314 there is an economic downturn affecting the whole of the uk and edinburgh is no exception
527315 i am not going to apologise for something for which the ioc is not responsible we are not running the internet in china
527316 let me make it clear the ioc is in favour of the broadest amount of internet access for the media that is the bottom line secondly there has been no deal at any time between the ioc leadership and the games organisers to accept any restrictions
527317 when beijing was awarded the olympic games the ioc promised the media the fullest access to the internet and bocog the organising committee has said it will deliver
527318 for the leader of msps at holyrood not for the leader in scotland
527319 they are able to state their case while the scottish labour leader has to be more guarded people in westminster and local government need to realise the realities of devolution that hasnt happened
527320 what i would say is that as things currently stand they the holyrood leader leave themselves at a severe disadvantage
527321 lets not forget this vote is for the leader of msps at holyrood not for the leader in scotland
527322 everyone talks about labour mps being london centric nobody talks about the msps being edinburgh centric but that is what they are this is basically about creating an snp mark two
527323 it is madness to say that they have to have a dividing line with london labour this kind of thing drove henry mcleish and it drove jack and it has got us precisely nowhere we need someone to change the record
527324 his position is that it doesnt matter about the name of the job the person who wins this contest will have a mandate
527325 that is what you are going to get from going to the entire electoral college the scottish labour leader at holyrood will be a distinctive scottish voice
527326 this is a classic turf war labour politicians in both parliaments are so preoccupied with having power they are rapidly losing it
527327 the determination and strong purpose shown by gordon are why he will lead us into the next election and win the confidence of the country all of us are focused on that
527328 when you face these kinds of global problems you need as prime minister someone who is respected on the international stage and someone whose hard work and ability over the last 11 years has made britain better off
527329 we do not want a summer of leadership speculation we have got a good case to make and we should get out there and make it all of this leadership speculation gets in the way of us putting our message across
527330 we will make a fatal error by not giving gordon a chance to roll out his plans yes he is a serious bloke dare i say he may come over a bit boring hes not a trained actor hes a deep thinker let me tell you this fellow is no mug
527331 in moral terms government cannot stand aside and watch families being driven into fuel poverty
527332 i urge the prime minister to come out of his bunker and tackle the deflationary forces in the economy action must be taken to resurrect consumer confidence
527333 we dont have the depth of talent that we had when the likes of myself and yvonne murray were running
527334 it is frustrating to watch runners get praised to high heaven for recording times that are five seconds slower then we were doing 20 years ago
527335 we havent got a lot to shout about just now so we grab on to anything thats going
527336 running has become over technical it has gone away from what the sport is all about to me running is all about hard work and training
527337 there is too much time spent going to psychologists and nutritionists now
527338 what made people run faster 20 years ago was that we went out there and trained hard
527339 all the telltale signs were there they wouldnt run well all year and then all of a sudden when the championships came around their performances would be transformed
527340 there seems to have been a general drop in standards steve jones broke the marathon record in 1985 and the current british competitors are a long way off that time
527341 that said there are some people doing well now and i wouldnt say they were not training hard enough
527342 my son lewis recently broke a scottish schools record that had stood for 31 years so i dont think standards have deteriorated our youngsters train really hard and put in 100 effort its not the case that kids arent committed
527343 the iraqi government broke their branches and took down their tree
527344 they used to come and order us to give them 100 gas canisters
527345 they used to brag that they were in the mahdi army now they are afraid to say it out loud
527346 the sadr office used to be the soul of the militia
527347 you still get punished if you talk bad about them
527348 the main motive is to exclude the sadr movement from politics
527349 instead of investing in the stock market or real estate these people are investing in buying the economic rights to football players
527350 weve been investing 10m a year but that is growing quickly because there are big profits to be made
527351 it is clear that they are not supposed to do that and it goes against the regulations
527352 no club shall enter into a contract which enables any other party to that contract or third party to acquire the ability to influence in employment or transfer related matters its independence its policies or the performance of its teams
527353 there are some irresponsible individuals who just want to make a short term profit
527354 but if it is done properly then it will change football investment will come into brazil
527355 his role as leader should be reflected in his attire he plays it safe with suits but his appearance is a statement about the state of his nation from a psychological point of view we can say that his attire could be interpreted as a reflection of a tentative approach towards independence a clear bespoke approach would send out the right messages to the political campfires across europe and indeed the world
527356 if alex salmond was styled in the right way in one of the finest cut and tailored suits that scotland could offer he could really show off what we can do
527357 there are some splendid tailors in savile row who are scottish and in scotland we have beautiful yarns and very fine fabrics
527358 i would give her a bit more of a glamorous image there is a new designer range by scottish cashmere producers johnstons that takes the classic things like twin sets made from cashmere and makes them modern and beautiful she could wear it with funky skirts or even an updated version of a kilt
527359 its not about exterior appearance its about interior morals in this case his stark conservative and classic look is modelled on imminent reason in his world go kenny i think hes got it right
527360 im inclined to think that politicians should be their own people with an individual style and personality
527361 more and more politicians get to parliament with all their ideas and drive and passion and very quickly it gets channelled out
527362 you shouldnt have a pr telling you what to say and do these days everything is about public relations
527363 in terms of being supportive to scotland and scottish fashion thats great but if i was a scottish politician i would go out and find a scottish designer or tailor that i really liked and i would wear something that really suited me
527364 i dont think its a bad idea if people wear scottish designers when they go abroad but at home i think they should be able to wear what they want
527365 not since bobby charlton fought arthur scargill over a comb has there been advertisement a more futile contest
527366 the person who would close an eye to centuries of labour struggle to improve the quality of life for all
527367 i have to say i think the leader in scotland needs to have a much wider voice a much more influential voice and a much stronger voice thats what i intend to say during the campaign
527368 there was a cabinet meeting when jack had to make a phone call to brown to check that everything was ok you cant carry on having that kind of thing happening
527369 you always get the impression from mps that in terms of policy they are the top dogs so if gordon brown appoints des browne then he is the top dog in scotland the job cannot be seen as secondary in importance the leader in the scottish parliament has to be primary
527370 it is madness for andy to have to have a dividing line with london labour this kind of thing drove henry mcleish and it drove jack and it has got us precisely nowhere we need someone to change the record
527371 we would just be moving towards an snp mark 2 if that is andys position then a lot of people will be thinking twice about giving him their support
527372 its an odd strategy to say that i will take on salmond by launching an attack on my own party
527373 i dont think its for me or other mps to offer backing
527374 lets not forget this vote is for the leader of msps at holyrood not for the leader in scotland
527375 the thing about cathy is that she knows how to tickle the partys erogenous zone
527376 this is the minister who backed privatisation at every step now she is left wing after all
527377 if any of these three went into their local tesco youd have to wonder whether anyone would know who they were
527378 when you look at why a politician like david does something its all about those who are pushing him
527379 if you do something like that you basically have to regurgitate the old line about gordon being the best man to lead us through tough times blah blah for david not to even mention brown in the piece was extraordinary
527380 the truth is this you dont do what he did unless youre up to something
527381 by doing what he has done now he has established himself as a player rather than the passive figure he was up till now nobody can now say he hasnt got the balls we knew he had the youth and the charisma he is regarded as a player internationally now he has the politics too to go with it
527382 itll all be about who is lunching with the general secretary of unite and who is sitting next to the head of unison
527383 he is so obvious a successor that gordon cant do it
527384 its going to be like the old days when you had browns leadership speech followed by blairs except now its miliband
527385 i dont want to spend any more time in any of her majestys holiday camps i wont follow women anymore i know its wrong
527386 i will be vigilant from now on i am never going to give anyone the chance to send me away again i have changed
527387 i walked with her for a bit and from her perspective maybe it was unwanted attention but she didnt make that clear
527388 it didnt seem like she was telling me to go away if shed told me to leave id have done so straight away
527389 that was at 12 33pm i know because just a minute before id made a call from my mobile to check how much credit i had left
527390 i dont want people to always say theres barry george he killed jill dando
527391 i want them to say theres barry george he didnt kill jill dando
527392 the police made it up theyre responsible for the gunpowder ive got pictures of police going in my flat with guns thats how it got there
527393 i can hardly believe im a free man at last i am well relieved when they said not guilty i was really shocked
527394 i was shocked that there was any verdict at all at my first trial the jury took five days and i thought it would be next week
527395 i was preparing myself for another weekend in my cell even my legal team was about to leave the court for the day and then we got the phone call to say there was a verdict
527396 encourage the police to arrest more people for drunken anti social behaviour
527397 the snp is punishing all consumers for the problems caused by a minority and voters know it
527398 scottish shoppers resent the prospect of the scottish government pushing up alcohol prices and restricting how and when alcohol can be sold
527399 clearly worded to elicit responses which reflect the interests of the wsta itself
527400 we would welcome any constructive suggestions on how we can tackle alcohol misuse
527401 if i point to the no smoking sign the passenger will just laugh and keep smoking
527402 my customers would rather starve than not smoke and i would go out of business
527403 in china you cannot drink eat and socialise without a cigarette
527404 if you overprotect your children they dont build their immunity
527405 breathing a little smoke when they are small makes them stronger
527406 cigarettes have an extra value in china that helps improve many social interactions
527407 yes im addicted but so is everyone else at the office
527408 if we didnt smoke i dont know how we would get anything done
527409 think of 1 000 wet raincoats and what they would smell like
527410 and in downmarket areas people may have had a bath once a week if that in a tin bath
527411 its an interesting social history of this tremendous entertainment that everyone went to so often before television it has a lot to do with cinema going which other collections like the film institute dont cover i think its more important being together
527412 there were great bundles of stills lobby cards and posters tied up i asked what was happening to them and i was told that they were waiting to go to the corporation dump
527413 so i came round in my vauxhall and filled it up with these photos there were so many that i couldnt see the back window or side window i think i made a couple of trips
527414 i saw my first film there when i was two snow white and the seven dwarfs i dont remember but my mother wrote it in her diary
527415 there will be a lot of people in this community who are prejudiced against voting for a black man
527416 personally i think its time that someone black became president it shows that anyone can be voted president of this country
527417 historically there has been a lot of tension between the hispanic and african american community it is economic
527418 latinos have recently become the largest minority in the us and they have been taking jobs and political positions that used to be controlled by african americans this has inevitably created political social and economic tensions
527419 it matters that obama is black for some latinos there is suspicion about the african american candidate that is something obama has to deal with that mccain doesnt
527420 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
527421 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
527422 nowadays no one can reach the white house without the latino vote
527423 a decade ago it was enough for a candidate to speak a few words of spanish and say viva mexico or viva cuba this time latino voters are forcing the candidates to give them something in return for their vote
527424 they are concerned about the same issues as the rest of the electorate the economy the war in iraq jobs education housing healthcare
527425 the gap between the two parties is larger now than at any time in 10 years
527426 a lot of latino people around here who are republican are saying its time for change the issues that will decide this election are the same whether you are latino or black
527427 weve probably had 100 people come in asking for the drug in the last couple years
527428 its for animals everything here is for animals we thought they were giving it to their animals
527429 to witness it it looks as peaceful as can be
527430 i usually recommend that they take it with their favourite drink since it has a bitter taste ive never seen anyone finish their whisky or champagne there isnt enough time to give a speech you go to sleep and then you die
527431 i went into the first shop that was advertised as being a vet and i showed the photo and they handed it over
527432 im 78 and my wife is 85 ive got this incurable disease and when four very big policemen came marching up the front steps it was very disconcerting
527433 there is going to be a relaxing of the dress protocols advertisement and people are being encouraged to wear lighter clothing
527434 for me its a great success and not a failure
527435 i was in tears when the captain of the boat with me made me come aboard because i still had plenty of energy left even though id spent 14 5 hours in the water
527436 theres no question i stink im not denying it i do have an odour
527437 until now renting has been a dirty word with people seeing it as money down the drain now mortgage rationing will push us into a more continental approach in which the majority rents
527438 for several months demand for stock has been approximately 40 above our normal monthly average had the properties been available our lettings tally during july would have exceeded 200 this is a phenomenon across the country as every letting agency in scotland is incredibly busy
527439 one of the reasons for the upsurge in demand for unfurnished lettings is that increasing numbers of clients have been or still are home owners with belongings of their own
527440 about 50 of new rental demand now relates to unfurnished properties whereas historically 90 of rental requests had been for furnished flats and houses as a result there is now little or no difference between what it costs to rent a furnished and unfurnished property
527441 we even have successful sellers moving to rented accommodation happy to see the proceeds of the sale earning 6 5 interest they are in no rush to move back to being owner occupiers as they seem to think that prices will fall further before they start to rise again
527442 there are a lot of people looking to rent in the short term while they wait for the market and economic climate to improve weve seen a growing demand for rented accommodation from people who have been advised by estate agents and solicitors to sell their property first before purchasing another
527443 the properties they are demanding are usually unfurnished as the families moving into them already have their own furniture and are looking for somewhere they can settle in the short term before buying a new home of their own
527444 they see renting as less hassle than buying a property while others are put off from moving onto the citys property ladder in the current economic climate
527445 we used to supply 11 or 12 vans every summer but now there are only four or five regular vans and they are the ones that do it all year round
527446 the good ones are steady enough if they have got a good established run but its the ones who just do it for the summer that are disappearing they think they are going to make a fortune and its just not true any more
527447 skimmed powder was around 1 400 a ton last year and now its 2 200 a ton some of the suppliers were up to 3 000 at one point
527448 its steadied off now but i dont see it coming down again also sugar is fairly dear as well
527449 a long time ago there used to be about 35 vans around east lothian but its probably less than 10 vans now
527450 i have three vans but im lucky i have also got the caf it accounts for 60 of my sales now without it i would struggle to survive on just the ice cream
527451 ice cream vans are the last dinosaurs of the vans that used to go around the houses and they are about to become extinct
527452 its general talk amongst the traders everyones complaining about prices all we can do is try to find cheaper suppliers everyone has got to buckle down and take the hit
527453 we had a terrible start to this month and that hit everyones sales after a difficult summer last year the last two weeks have been great and thats been a big bonus
527454 but we could do with another six weeks of sun and its looking mixed without the weather we will see more people struggling to get by
527455 im carrying on in the business but my son has given up so im getting rid of his van
527456 if i wasnt so passionate about ice cream i would give up too but ive been in it since i was 15 years old and i love the work
527457 i could name so many people that have been and gone with their ice cream vans in my immediate vicinity
527458 there must be hundreds of people across the country that cant keep it going because theyve come so close to the wire
527459 there will come a time we will have to draw the line when the bills dont get paid its very much a matter of not sinking below that line
527460 we were paying or rather the taxpayer was paying rushdie to protect him
527461 mean nasty tight fisted arrogant and extremely unpleasant in my opinion i am none of those things
527462 the simple fact is that nothing of this sort happened my relationship with my protection team was always cordial certainly entirely professional this kind of absurd behaviour never occurred
527463 there are three references to drinking on duty it is absolutely forbidden for police officers particularly in possession of firearms to drink on duty it is absurd the idea that they would lock me in a cupboard and go to the pub
527464 the idea that i was so unpleasant to them that they locked me up is totally made up
527465 police officers thought if i was incurring costs it would be fair to contribute to that
527466 this is not a free speech issue this is libel
527467 i will not have my character destroyed and presented to the world as something that it is not if they publish it as it is there will be a libel action
527468 we regret that he chooses to publish this book there were a number of passages within the draft that caused us concern following legal advice we negotiated with the publishers to make some alterations
527469 you have to decide either be trampled under hamas shoes or stand in dignity
527470 we are determined to continue the raid until we arrest all those involved
527471 helpless child sitting unattended unkempt and unwashed in a small stroller in her own urine and faeces
527472 this behaviour indicates that andrea kelly did not merely allow danieal to die she may have even wanted her disabled daughter to die
527473 id like to think some good may come of what i have gone through and that anyone who thinks they can get away with such behaviour might be forced to think again while anyone who thinks they cant do anything about such treatment might see they dont have to put up with it
527474 with a new man at the top of the sfa and tighter procedures it seems there is a greater willingness to tackle racism
527475 this has hung over me for two years and it is a massive relief that the court proved i was telling the truth all along which the sfa ruling left open to doubt
527476 it has been really unpleasant to have to keep reliving this
527477 it was so weird hearing the verdict delivered and knowing that it was finally all over in that instant and that i could get on with my life it hurt that the sfa judgment let the player and team involved present themselves as the injured parties
527478 they made out as if me and my club spartans were stringing this out so we could be publicity seeking crusaders when all we ever wanted was the truth to be acknowledged
527479 i was twice racially abused by wayne mcintosh that has been proved beyond any doubt
527480 it is now a matter of record that what i have been saying for two years has not been my version of events but what actually happened
527481 for so many people especially in the game it seemed that it was the one topic of conversation when they met me
527482 apart from those at whitehill welfare though everyone in the east of scotland league has been supportive because they know my character and the character of the other person
527483 but it weighed so heavily there have been many occasions when i have asked myself if i would go through it all again if i found myself in the same situation
527484 after much soul searching i have been able to answer yes and im relieved the courts took the action that allowed me to come up with that answer
527485 ben remains critically ill he has not required sedative drugs at any time over the last 24 hours yet remains in a coma
527486 if ben remains in a coma once the stabilising measures that are dealing with blood chemistry and temperature are completed it is likely we will proceed to brain stem testing
527487 the team which will include one officer from south wales police will support the local senior investigating officers and have been sent following a request from the antiguan authorities received through the foreign and commonwealth office
527488 he put his life on the line for other people all through his career i want his family to know that i will be teaching my son about modern day heroes like him
527489 in moral terms government cannot stand aside and watch families being driven into fuel poverty
527490 i urge the prime minister to come out of his bunker and tackle the deflationary forces in the economy action must be taken to resurrect consumer confidence
527491 there is room for manoeuvre in fiscal policy and a substantial economic boost is necessary for example the net borrowing forecast for this year was 43bn the equivalent figure in the last downturn in 1992 93 was 68 2bn
527492 the biggest windfall gainer offshore is the chancellor himself whose oil revenues are heading for 15bn in the current financial year
527493 its time that the snp played their part in supporting under pressure scots co operation is the way forward for scotland not conflict for conflicts sake
527494 salmonds megaphone diplomacy will not make any scottish home warmer or greener
527495 scotland has proved more resistant to financial pressures than other parts of the uk however with deflationary forces becoming stronger by the day scotland is not immune to the economic downturn
527496 in spite of the national policy vacuum really even active resistance from washington a green economy is starting to emerge around the country this new green economy is driven by local actors often with partnerships between government business and non profits
527497 this is another instance of the grassroots flowing around the gatekeepers but since companies are making money the design of an eventual ecosystem is appearing
527498 how can local state and national bloggers help drive and coordinate these efforts
527499 this is not a discussion of blogs as opposition or protest tools we want ideas about how bloggers can support positive economic development that has a green aspect to it and use blogs to promote positive change in local economies
527500 i love it big brother is watching and everyone cheers
527501 one other note thanks mike arrington and tc for covering this issue definitely not the usual fodder for a tech blog and i think its great you are bringing this to light
527502 i am not interested in telling my story i wanted them to come out and admit that abuse did go on in scotland but they have never done that what happened to me was decades ago and i still get upset every day
527503 when we talk to each other it helps but nobody would go to a third party and speak about it
527504 the scottish government should lift the time bar and let us get justice but they never will because they know if they did they would be liable for millions of pounds for neglecting children in homes
527505 we were put in cold baths for wetting the bed then the bed sheets were wrapped around us and our pants were put on our heads we were fed porridge and if you couldnt eat it one of the carers would spoon feed you
527506 you would start gagging and they would force you to eat it if you were sick you were made to eat your own vomit as well you would end up on the floor in a heap and they would beat you
527507 this is the last thing we want i have deliberately stayed away because the last thing i want or need is to keep being reminded of my abuse my memories are hard enough to live with
527508 we are carefully considering a scottish truth and reconciliation forum which will give survivors the chance to speak about their experiences and to help come to terms with the past
527509 it will provide an opportunity to establish the facts learn from the suffering and use the experience to help us to protect children in the future
527510 we will consult publicly and with survivors of abuse support organisations and other providers of care on our approach in coming months
527511 today we have consumer habits whether its going to ikea or elsewhere which necessitate that once in a while even those who cant afford cars need to use one and in this sense i think this will complement public transportation
527512 we should be open to this type of initiative knowing that there is not one solution to the problems of transportation and climate change
527513 if its easy to park at autolib stations i would use that
527514 and i would definitely prefer to drive a car that doesnt pollute
527515 its true that not everyone can afford to buy their own car so it could be very useful
527516 i think some excellent books are on the longlist but i cannot respect a judging committee that decides to pick a book like tom rob smiths child 44 a fairly well written and well paced thriller that is no more than that over novels as exceptional as helen garners the spare room or ross raisins gods country
527517 i will declare my bias as the publisher at canongate i had a vested interest in seeing the spare room make the shortlist but from an objective point of view this novel has been as well reviewed as any book we have ever published
527518 anyone of whom i would respect as a judge of serious fiction more than all five of these judges put together
527519 one has to be philosophical about these things and as a publisher you come to realise what a lottery these prizes are i am certain that the spare room is a modern classic that will continue to be read and enjoyed and appreciated long after all of us are dead
527520 i cant possibly comment on a competition that it still alive other than to say that i wish that we were celebrating the 13 authors that were longlisted for their achievements
527521 there have been e mail exchanges where he byng claimed that we had not even read the books
527522 i put myself under considerable pressure making sure i got every single book read and making a decision that felt impossible
527523 i really do not appreciate being undermined in this way
527524 it validates what most of us who read contemporary crime fiction already know which is that the genre has transformed itself to a point where the best of its output can stand shoulder to shoulder with any other novels
527525 we have been waiting for years for a thriller to appear on the list it is totally deserved though i am surprised because while it is an excellent thriller it is not a particularly literary book
527526 ok ive been doing the work and im doing the things i said i would do i had a couple of little missteps but now im going to get back in line and im going to keep forging ahead
527527 did i do what i said i was going to do
527528 we have a lot of history with this tire on the sports car side
527529 were expecting them to be able to go a full fuel cycle
527530 back when the wga struck in 1988 i was a starry eyed newcomer in television
527531 she thought the writers were way too polite to people coming and going to the studio and that we should have been causing more of a ruckus
527532 every lap every lap i was concerned about it every corner for that matter
527533 as a group we all knew we couldnt push the envelope i knew at the end a seven lap shootout i could blast it off in there and id be ok
527534 we came with the best tire we had for the conditions and we fell short well try to get it right
527535 i dont think anybody likes to race like this us included well do what we can to make it better
527536 if you are a good fan and you didnt get what you wanted its ok to be disappointed and we can be disappointed right along with you were here to put on the best races we can and we do a damn good job of it most of the time everybody inside these walls works real hard to do that
527537 i was worried the stop before that maybe we had to go two less to win this thing
527538 thats a long day i know everybodys trying to do their best
527539 i just personally want to say to the fans everybodys doing their best to make that race at least we got to run at the end
527540 i dont think anyone could push their car as hard as they would have liked to today
527541 i was patient as i ever was in any other race when i wanted to run hard i could look like i was 20 mph better than anyone else but i knew i was going to pay for it in the end
527542 it was kind of fun little 10 lap sprints little heat races getting new tires every 10 laps it was great
527543 the truth of the deal is that was the best show we could put on today nascar did everything right
527544 its all we could do aside from loading up and going home and not running at all yeah it wasnt quite the race everybody expected but shoot it was better than some of the races youve probably seen here
527545 this is one of the two biggest races of the year i feel bad for the fans were running three quarters speed because were worried about the tires blowing out they got blown out every eight laps
527546 the car snapped loose and there it went i just made a mistake out there
527547 i got in beside hornish and got loose and then menard just ran me over
527548 it wasnt a track issue just racing i have to control my car its not hornishs fault
527549 sydney doesnt want to sit in quiet and peace and enjoy a drink and a chat
527550 elizabeth edwards is the real reason this story hasnt gained traction until now
527551 lets not make any waves thats not polite might get us thrown out of the candidates press tent
527552 bagaimana mungkin seorang muslim seperti abdurrahman wahid tega ikut serta merayakan kezaliman atas saudara saudara muslimnya sendiri
527553 sudah berbulan bulan 1 5 juta saudara saudara anda terutama anak anak saat ini hidup tanpa bahan bakar tanpa obat obatan dan makanan yang sangat terbatas karena diblokade oleh zionis israel
527554 minggu lalu bekas presiden as jimmy carter juga dilarang israel masuk ke gaza
527555 ada 6 juta saudara saudara anda bangsa palestina yang sekarang diusir oleh zionis israel dan terpaksa hidup di pengungsian
527556 para duta besar itu bekerja untuk kepentingan kemerdekaan dan kesejahteraan bangsa palestina jangan sampai mereka memperkeruh suasana dengan menjelek jelekkan kelompok tertentu yang mengakibatkan lemahnya persatuan bangsa palestina
527557 siapa yang benar benar bekerja untuk kemerdekaan palestina dan siapa yang hanya bikin masalah
527558 tapi kami ingin menyampaikan bahwa prioritas pekerjaan kami adalah rekonsiliasi rakyat palestina keselamatan mereka dan dikembalikannya hak hak mereka di manapun mereka berada
527559 hopefully we can come back in a month and show that the us is the best swimming team in the world
527560 i think it will give our womens team a rallying cry it is something to think about and work on in the next five weeks
527561 i will never be free as long as i am an isolated individual struggling against nature freedom comes from surrender and the first surrender must be to nature itself
527562 human energy cannot sustain yoga only the universal energy can for that to enter our system all human energy must be fully exhausted no drop of energy should go to preserve the existing activities thus he arrives at the method of surrender
527563 and to know this love that surpasses knowledge that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of the one
527564 turn around god is still in the same place he was when you made the mistake it is you who moved
527565 i completely surrender to the divine on all levels of my being and i now create the space needed to be filled i allow divine light to fill me with what i need at this time and i move into total and complete alignment with absolute consciousness as such i am able to receive any information necessary for my good and i am able to release anything that is not for my highest good
527566 the only one who is going to be hurt here is that sea urchin
527567 it should become clear that nintendo doesnt intend to battle sony and microsoft in the old market but in the new one while nintendo as a company may not have the resources to battle in the old world nintendo has become demi god like in the new world where process matters not resources in the new world the strengths of microsoft and sony become liabilities while nintendos weaknesses become strengths through disruption nintendo has re defined the battlefield
527568 motion plus would also change the very nature of how the core games should be take zelda for example motion plus begs zelda to be a 1 1 sword control of course all that has to be tested and a game has to be made around the concept and nintendo is nowhere near that since they are barely scrapping together wii sports resort the real question is why wii music wasnt sent back to be enhanced with the motion plus as something like the drums could really use it corporations like everyone else had to look at it from a tactical nature they chose to delay other games to be enhanced and send wii music out to die
527569 if the press learned the disruption language they could have asked better questions and got better answers
527570 disruption is about disrupting ones competitors has nintendo taken it too far and disrupted their core customers
527571 the path sony and microsoft have gone has put them in a box nintendo wants to make sure they stay in that box sustaining change is a sign of war the industry will be quite surprised to watch current lamb like nintendo transform into aggressive lion should a competitor enter their expanded market by getting motion plus out there nintendo will have developers used to working with it way before a competitor can come up with their own proposal

527583 the original battalion would do anything from four to 35 miles in a 24 hour period
527584 and part of the route is the santa fe trail
527585 but the part from council bluffs to fort leavenworth is really not known very well
527586 to hold those old documents you know you get goose bumps
527587 i would say its looked upon as a curiosity more than anything
527588 by entering into an intimate relationship with a lawyer who practiced before her and then presiding however briefly over matters in which the lawyer appeared as counsel hartl failed to act in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary
527589 in addition hartls behavior becoming highly intoxicated in front of her court staff and revealing to them details of her sexual encounter with the public defender was undignified
527590 her subsequent conversations with the commission staff and her voice message to the court administrator reasonably appeared to be an effort to conceal her misconduct by misleading the commission and by suggesting other potential witnesses withhold relevant information
527591 oh my gosh this is like my best birthday ever
527592 when i first read the books and saw that it was here i had been here a long time ago and was just so super psyched because it was like i have actually been there
527593 but i think there will be a twist and it will all end in a cliffhanger or something
527594 our house even has a blue room and yellow cabinets like in the book
527595 we have about 120 or 130 people in here a day

527611 met hierdie plan sal die foute van die verlede ook reggestel word die dae van net olifante uitroei is verby maar in die uiterste gevalle sal dit m t kom
527612 dr rob little waarnemende hoofbeampte van die bewaringsgroep wwf het ges di organisasie besef dat plaaslike gebiede waar olifante voorkom oorbevolk is en dat dit vir die meeste suider afrikaanse state n besondere uitdaging gaan wees om die getalle te bestuur van schalkwyk het voorgestel uitdunning is met die bestuur van water geslote gebiede die skep van deurgange hervestiging en die toediening van voorbehoedmiddels net een van die opsies in die nuwe bestuurplan
527613 die wwf is nie voorstaanders van uitdunning as die enigste bestuursmoontlikheid nie ons meen olifante moet alleen as n laaste uitweg uitgedun word nadat alle ander moontlikhede uitgeskakel is

527622 giving comprehensible and appropriate information about survival benefit is extremely difficult however the reluctance to address these difficulties and sensitivities may be hampering patients ability to make informed decisions about their future treatment
527623 id like all patients with incurable cancer to have the information they need to make a decision about whether to have this treatment
527624 but this needs nationally agreed and regularly updated statistics and earlier conversations with their doctor about the pros and cons of treatment in the last month
527625 at the moment much depends on the doctor you see
527626 this small but interesting study sheds some light on the particular difficulties in communicating information about palliative chemotherapy treatment decisions
527627 yo soy una persona que vine del campo a la ciudad luch y luch y hoy mis hijos est n estudiando uno de ellos est en la universidad y los otros dos en la escuela es un regalo de dios
527628 after the eighth time all the time you are feeling scared
527629 no one would want to put a confectionary store here with all the publicity and all that went on
527630 wouldnt you think that the rest of the insurgents would be up now
527631 but the rebel leaders were planning to have a meeting outside before the troops awoke
527632 well biggs lily and i are morning people i was only afk when shade proposed us four to be at the meeting and by then he said you were already awake so i just waited for the gears to be in motion
527633 if you havent noticed the 4th wall has been broken for years its been ruined to the point of being a smoldering pile of ashes so anything like that is clearly to be expected
527634 this is yukan isarilli the ninja leader of the rewy forces
527635 first i have information leading that youre down a few lieutenants
527636 we give kyte lily and biggs the open positions the training program is impressive but most of our men dont even have real combat experience moon wolves may not be the best experience but it beats most of our other candidates and their valor in escaping the moon raid has given them a sweet spot among the other men
527637 there are already whisperings about a fallen aristocrat taking up the fight how he seems too cushy for the job theres nothing to do but keep going
527638 your previous experience from school projects tends to say otherwise
527639 the battle plan as previously spoken of included our main forces meeting theirs while an elite group of men enter the side of the enemys skyscraper so as to assassinate their leader from the inside
527640 but all you wanted to do was play your games
527641 but id like a proposal about the elite team headed for the capital
527642 youre serious weve done back checks on all of them and this one doesnt show for any swords skills
527643 so we dont mean anything what about rick what was his sacrifice for damn it
527644 ricks sacrifice was valiant but we cant cry over the past
527645 this mission has enough chance of failure and said chance would be greatly reduced if nyushin was to be in the elite group
527646 we all know what we stand for we all have lived these past years shrouded by the shadows that were cast over us by this erroneous government weve worked hard for this day and now its time to stand up for our freedom whos with me
527647 we only have a few hundred men you sure thisll work
527648 ive split up the troops in half between me and lily and biggs ill take my half in the more direct path in order to make one flank lily and biggs will take their half and loop down around the city in order to give a second flank itll hopefully work in these strained city streets
527649 ya know theres a park near there so thatll help
527650 i just hope it doesnt get razed in the process
527651 im proud that ive won on every tour basically i havent won a world golf championship so it would mean a lot and obviously give me a massive amount of confidence going into the next week
527652 a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference
527653 i didnt really address it until i missed it big on 11 and 13 because i had been playing so well and i felt like it was only a couple of yards off the fairway most of the time
527654 this is a very dynamic park there have been melting glaciers for the last three years but weve never seen anything like this in the 40 years the park has been in existence
527655 what happened in pangnirtung is what appears to be happening in the park
527656 weve lost huge chunks of our trails there were established foot trails that are completely gone now
527657 were getting more rain were getting earlier ice melting and later freeze ups
527658 beijing time of course planes and trains stick to beijing time but buses run on xinjiang time
527659 that depends if it is a han chinese school it is 0800 beijing time if it is a uighur school it is 0800 xinjiang time which is two hours later and if it is a mixed school they stick to beijing time
527660 they the palestinians were asking to enter the state of israel after being threatened by hamas gunmen
527661 beijing time of course planes and trains stick to beijing time but buses run on xinjiang time
527662 that depends if it is a han chinese school it is 0800 beijing time if it is a uighur school it is 0800 xinjiang time which is two hours later and if it is a mixed school they stick to beijing time
527663 what a fucking douchebag does anyone really give a shit about this
527664 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
527665 anytime race is the topic du jour in the campaign its a bad day for obama period
527666 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
527667 weve achieved more in the last two years than in the preceding 20
527668 we need now to continue these efforts more than ever otherwise all our previous investments will be wiped out
527669 there are still five new infections for every two people newly added to treatment
527670 her first words were that she was very happy to see nice people she was very pleased with that she was ecstatic about that
527671 when clark left the apartment he was immediately placed under arrest by fbi agents simultaneously agents made their way to the apartment to find reigh at approximately 3 29 p m reigh was located alone in the apartment where she was reportedly excited to see the law enforcement officials her appearance has not been altered and reigh appears to be unharmed
527672 reighs mother sandra boss was overjoyed by this news she is being reunited with her daughter and she wishes to express her deepest gratitude to all those involved in bringing reigh home
527673 investigators continue their efforts to try to determine clark rockefellers true identity
527674 we want to grow the business over a three to five year period we are executing against that plan and we are still doing that despite all the stuff thats happened to us
527675 i think they had an opportunity to get something done in the palm of their hand and they bungled it
527676 i am more determined and more excited than ever to see those changes through
527677 they dont get it they dont understand the realities of their business
527678 i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
527679 its all boiling down to he really doesnt want to hurt those former teammates
527680 its just of a matter of what he wants more is playing more important or keeping those guys out of the friction that would come if he reports
527681 mark murphy had talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
527682 and frankly its good for brett because brett needs to stay part of football and obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
527683 i dont think it makes any sense for us to speculate
527684 we talked a lot about this and well just leave it at that
527685 the philosophy is that they squeeze you out the top like a tube of toothpaste thats what montgomery county math is
527686 thinks hes fine his parents think hes fine the school system says hes fine but hes not fine
527687 we have the best courses and theres no achievement gap and everything is wonderful
527688 whats the best way to teach and whats the best way to learn and its not just in math its in all disciplines
527689 he knows more about mathematics from kindergarten through college than anyone i know
527690 he has an understanding of how the concepts thread themselves through the years
527691 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
527692 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
527693 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
527694 if weve got a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like then obviously thats something that i would consider because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
527695 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
527696 thats how we can protect our coastline and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good
527697 its not going to provide short term relief or medium term relief or in fact long term relief it wont drop prices in this administration or in the next administration or in the administration after that
527698 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
527699 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
527700 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling
527701 the president has failed in his economic policy and now he wants to say but for drilling in protected areas offshore our economy would be thriving and the price of gas would be lower
527702 that hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to relieve the pain of consumers at the pump and to promote energy independence

527705 we scored a magnificent goal through urby but we were a little bit lucky
527706 we had a lot of problems with the ivory coast and were losing the ball too much we could have lost this game
527707 if we had converted our chances we could have won tonight
527708 were very happy with this week as weve come through two matches played at a high level
527709 im very confident in my players now as we now focus on the olympics
527710 but i think my heart and souls always been here
527711 im a new yorker im here i dont rush home to turn the tv on or anything like that
527712 if the girls or my wife are watching something on tv theyll watch it and ill flip back and forth maybe even once in a while but no im looking forward to moving past all of that to where its not a central point in my life so im just a regular dude
527713 no i have a lot of people there that i really have a big affection for david wright and damion easley and marlon anderson and those guys aaron heilman
527714 those are my guys and a big part of me feels thats my team
527715 listen i led that team back to where it is today you dont just let that go obviously i want them to do well because thats the team that ive lived and died with for the last three years that doesnt change anything
527716 i grew up here i learned my chops here i learned how to be a winner a champion here
527717 nobody wants to go on the dl no matter what it is
527718 there is always a letdown when you cant be out there but i think its best in the end to get this thing worked out and taken care of
527719 i grew up here i learned my chops here i learned to be a winner a champion here i get to sit here the whole day and go through the memories i experienced these are my boys this is a family and im happy to be part of it today
527720 willie deserves it thats why these are the best fans in the world you want to applaud them for doing that
527721 you get a group of people that are going to come together for a cause bikers are it and we all come together its all for a great thing
527722 we know some kids that have birth defects and we know that all the money raised is for them
527723 you have these guys underneath the big beards and the leather and the tough image you got a lot of big hearts a lot of guys who really yea theyre tough guys but when it comes to kids theyre really all about the kids
527724 pride you know its nice to be part of something like this and you get a good feeling afterward when you get back and you realize you did something that was worth while
527725 nobody wants to go on the dl no matter what it is
527726 there is always a letdown when you cant be out there but i think its best in the end to get this thing worked out and taken care of
527727 im a big believer in once a guy gets to the big leagues i dont want him to sit around and think about it
527728 i want him to get out there and play as quickly as possible
527729 hopefully this two week period will give him a real good chance to get that thing as strong as he can
527730 hes been pretty much playing on an unstable leg were going to try to find out if we can get some kind of stability in there

527776 no comment on anything related to the vice presidential issue
527777 many great intelligent talented academy winning actors standing by awaiting a major press conference to show their support
527778 the ad is a bit ironic given that mccain has been the most pop culture savvy republican candidate in quite some time
527779 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
527780 johns been a celebrity ever since he was shot down
527781 obama has almost transcended that and has become famous as a famous person which is why they are comparing him to paris hilton
527782 for the time being obama maintains the edge and has the strength of a majority of electoral votes his triumphant foreign trip allows him to continue to define this race but too many of these states are close and a sizable number are undecided or choosing a third party candidate so there is a lot of fluidity

527821 are you the one they talk about so much going to college
527822 its very very helpful to have a student in the class who along with me remembers lyndon johnson and his presidency who remembers nixon who remembers jimmy carter

527824 i dont have that many more years to live and i want to do good for humanity while im here
527825 does it feel like while youve been taking things at a leisurely pace and enjoying the view everyone else has zoomed ahead of you are you convinced that youre not where you should be in terms of your job your love life or you personal development do not panic relax you are doing things in a way that is right for you and that is the most important thing dont compare yourself too closely to other people right now focus on your own strengths and goals
527826 hey im not feeling good now can we meet i just need someone to listen to me and give me some constructive advice
527827 i dont think i can survive another year of this

527833 and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
527834 we didnt cover it because he had already denied it

527836 the truck was traveling from minot air force base to a launch facility in northwestern north dakota when it crashed on the gravel road thursday morning between parshall and makoti about 70 miles from the air base two airmen in the vehicle were not seriously injured
527837 that should be out on the internet in about 10 days
527838 we both love her dearly and have only her best interests and well being at heart
527839 i ask you now please please bring snooks back there has to be a better way for us to solve our differences than this way

527842 well maam its probably gonna run you about 350 to fix this dent
527843 but i do have a simple trick you can try at home that should take care of the problem
527844 take your car home and go inside while you wait for the engine to cool completely then go outside and blow really hard into the exhaust pipe and you should be able to blow your dent out
527845 well duh you have to roll up the windows first

527851 this is a devastating blow to everyone who has enjoyed seeing these beautiful creatures we know that bottlenose dolphins are in danger of disappearing from cornish waters as gradually one by one their numbers are dwindling
527852 i think its very misleading to say these figures challenge our the governments figures they are a different calculation altogether
527853 trying to get back into the roll or bun of things
527854 i just grew up working on his cars traveling with him on weekends driving all the hours to the tracks racing and coming home and working on race car at night
527855 he wouldnt have wanted to die any other way to be honest with you
527856 a big reason why i got into this business was because i did it with my dad
527857 my dad worked all the time and raced all the time so it was probably the only time i could see him and hang out with him was to work alongside him it evolved into something i wanted to do just from doing it on a everyday basis
527858 i oversee day to day operations of the race team on the competition side and call the shots on sunday
527859 at first i was like everyone else this is just a boring sport
527860 its hard to say i didnt expect to win because you never want to say you didnt expect to win
527861 my goal really was just to play well i knew my best could put me up there but this was a little bit of a surprise
527862 it was just because i love golf so much and i felt i had never given it as much time as i wanted to
527863 i decided this is what i wanted to do now and in the future
527864 it was just nice to know i could play with the guys who outdrive me by 100 yards i can still beat them
527865 maybe it was a good decision to give up diving
527866 up until the 1960s it was assumed that these guys are supermen they dont get depressed they dont have addictions
527867 no one would recognize the pain these guys were having and that they were subject to the same illnesses all of us are when society went to drugs athletes went to drugs they were part of society
527868 there was the old greek ideal sound mind sound body with these physical specimens it was assumed how could they fall prey to cocaine or something like that that was for people with weak wills and no character and these guys obviously were strong people
527869 they get girls pregnant they use drugs more than the average population
527870 is a weakness i can solve my own problems the stigmas there athletes are all about being in control and it scares them that they arent in control and they see it as a weakness and are afraid that if the word gets out when they do seek counseling other athletes will prey on that
527871 basically was educational creating an environment within the organization and the sport that recognized young men need tools other than playing tools to succeed
527872 sensitive to the environment they were in kids are not going to come jumping out of the woodwork to talk to you about their problems
527873 athletes are just young people that have this ability they usually have very little education and generally rely on their physical skills to get them through life and you know how long that lasts
527874 every major psychiatric problem that exists in the book schizophrenia personality disorders dysfunctional families relationship problems sexual problems sexual identity problems theyre no different than anybody else
527875 id say that athletes have the same range of problems as anybody else
527876 however the professional or college athlete has been honed for a specific skill their whole self identity is wrapped up in that one thing they can do very well almost as if they have a part not a whole person functioning
527877 so theyre frequently losing touch with themselves and with other people and probably are at risk of more psychological problems than the average population
527878 it looks better if they bring us in since they already have massage therapists acupuncturists nutritionists and so on
527879 it looks more holistic like theyre trying to help their athletes before they get into trouble drinking getting into risky sexual behaviors gambling situations
527880 to work with these athletes on the human being part because there are a lot of stresses and a tremendous amount of risky behavior as they get more vain and get more money and their lifestyles change in tremendous ways
527881 a associa o esclarece que o contato do procurador regional da rep blica com o padre francisco cadena oliv rio medina se limitou a visita realizada em nome da procuradoria federal dos direitos do cidad o penitenci ria na qual o sacerdote estava preso
527882 scientists are usually a fairly reserved bunch but even they are starting to sound frantic about whats happening with the climate
527883 thats not surprising given that if we carry on treating the planet like a cheap boil in the bag dinner we risk causing catastrophic climate change thats probably a bad idea
527884 what is your administration going to do to help reduce crime in america

527890 the government is appallingly behind on computer assisted translation because theyve invested all this money on machine translation
527891 the met service is expecting only one more band of heavy rain over the waikato today and then the weather will be clearing up until thursday this breathing space will help the river systems to start flushing out but due to the very full river systems in headwater areas we can expect high river levels for some time
527892 its the killer in front who gets covered with urbahns blood a killer who does not leave blood in the subaru because he leaves the scene in another car
527893 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
527894 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
527895 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
527896 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
527897 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
527898 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
527899 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open
527900 and the line between what could be considered as a national interest issue might be a bit blurred but well work on it and we will deal with any potential grievances
527901 dixon has been searched on a routine basis where he is currently been held and corrections is confident that he has no access to a cellphone
527902 to stop cellphone use within prison the department is currently rolling out cellphone blocking technology across the country
527903 the rapidly developing cellphone technology has made it increasingly difficult to stop cellphones and sim cards entering prisons and to detect them once they are there
527904 instead of investing in the stock market or real estate these people are investing in buying the economic rights to football players
527905 weve been investing 10m a year but that is growing quickly because there are big profits to be made
527906 it is clear that they are not supposed to do that and it goes against the regulations
527907 no club shall enter into a contract which enables any other party to that contract or third party to acquire the ability to influence in employment or transfer related matters its independence its policies or the performance of its teams
527908 there are some irresponsible individuals who just want to make a short term profit
527909 but if it is done properly then it will change football investment will come into brazil
527910 if i point to the no smoking sign the passenger will just laugh and keep smoking
527911 my customers would rather starve than not smoke and i would go out of business
527912 in china you cannot drink eat and socialise without a cigarette
527913 if you overprotect your children they dont build their immunity
527914 breathing a little smoke when they are small makes them stronger
527915 cigarettes have an extra value in china that helps improve many social interactions
527916 yes im addicted but so is everyone else at the office
527917 if we didnt smoke i dont know how we would get anything done
527918 i am not going to apologise for something for which the ioc is not responsible we are not running the internet in china
527919 let me make it clear the ioc is in favour of the broadest amount of internet access for the media that is the bottom line secondly there has been no deal at any time between the ioc leadership and the games organisers to accept any restrictions
527920 when beijing was awarded the olympic games the ioc promised the media the fullest access to the internet and bocog the organising committee has said it will deliver
527921 the iraqi government broke their branches and took down their tree
527922 they used to come and order us to give them 100 gas canisters
527923 they used to brag that they were in the mahdi army now they are afraid to say it out loud
527924 the sadr office used to be the soul of the militia
527925 you still get punished if you talk bad about them
527926 the main motive is to exclude the sadr movement from politics
527927 the behaviour of the paparazzi is out of control it needs to be reined in
527928 since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
527929 of somebody at my age of 63 wanting to learn one of the hardest languages
527930 somebodys appreciating their culture and thats the reason why people are so happy about the record
527931 the challenges of terrorism must be overcome in order for us to realise the potential of greater regional integration greater economic integration
527932 this terrorism is certainly one of the issues which for us is a very important part of the summit
527933 if we want to carry the saarcs economic and social agenda forward its essential that we manage to do this in an atmosphere free of violence
527934 weve probably had 100 people come in asking for the drug in the last couple years
527935 its for animals everything here is for animals we thought they were giving it to their animals
527936 to witness it it looks as peaceful as can be
527937 i usually recommend that they take it with their favourite drink since it has a bitter taste ive never seen anyone finish their whisky or champagne there isnt enough time to give a speech you go to sleep and then you die
527938 i went into the first shop that was advertised as being a vet and i showed the photo and they handed it over
527939 im 78 and my wife is 85 ive got this incurable disease and when four very big policemen came marching up the front steps it was very disconcerting
527940 there is going to be a relaxing of the dress protocols advertisement and people are being encouraged to wear lighter clothing
527941 for me its a great success and not a failure
527942 i was in tears when the captain of the boat with me made me come aboard because i still had plenty of energy left even though id spent 14 5 hours in the water
527943 theres no question i stink im not denying it i do have an odour
527944 i have dealt my whole life with fires but i have never seen a sight like this i can safely say that we are experiencing a catastrophe
527945 our only consolation is that there has been no loss of life the weather conditions are very poor
527946 my house was burned down but i saved my children and my husband who is sick with parkinsons disease
527947 contemporary witnesses told us that honecker was more or less frightened or shocked when he walked through here
527948 there will be a lot of people in this community who are prejudiced against voting for a black man
527949 personally i think its time that someone black became president it shows that anyone can be voted president of this country
527950 historically there has been a lot of tension between the hispanic and african american community it is economic
527951 latinos have recently become the largest minority in the us and they have been taking jobs and political positions that used to be controlled by african americans this has inevitably created political social and economic tensions
527952 it matters that obama is black for some latinos there is suspicion about the african american candidate that is something obama has to deal with that mccain doesnt
527953 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
527954 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
527955 nowadays no one can reach the white house without the latino vote
527956 a decade ago it was enough for a candidate to speak a few words of spanish and say viva mexico or viva cuba this time latino voters are forcing the candidates to give them something in return for their vote
527957 they are concerned about the same issues as the rest of the electorate the economy the war in iraq jobs education housing healthcare
527958 the gap between the two parties is larger now than at any time in 10 years
527959 a lot of latino people around here who are republican are saying its time for change the issues that will decide this election are the same whether you are latino or black
527960 we have not had any discussion or agreement of the so called timeline of two weeks
527961 iran expresses its grave concern regarding the double standards used by the united states
527962 this fire has absolutely devastated this family who have now not only lost their mother and grandmother but their little girl too
527963 we still believe there are people who are talking to each other about what happened but not talking to us i urge you to imagine how alanas mum and dad must be feeling and consider whether what you know could help them get justice for their little girl
527964 garry has been outstanding hes hit five in five and is looking frighteningly fit
527965 to his credit he worked extremely hard over the summer and i feel hes starting to get some of the nonsense out of his system theres only so much i can do as his manager but garry wants it himself it certainly augurs well for george burley and for scotland
527966 you have to decide either be trampled under hamas shoes or stand in dignity
527967 we are determined to continue the raid until we arrest all those involved
527968 they got the girl shes fine he left her in the apartment
527969 clark although many things have changed you will always be reighs father and i will always be reighs mother
527970 we both love her dearly and have only her best interests and wellbeing in our hearts i ask you now please please bring snooks back there has to be a better way for us to solve our differences than this way
527971 and reigh honey i love you and miss you so much remember youre always a princess
527972 today we have consumer habits whether its going to ikea or elsewhere which necessitate that once in a while even those who cant afford cars need to use one and in this sense i think this will complement public transportation
527973 we should be open to this type of initiative knowing that there is not one solution to the problems of transportation and climate change
527974 if its easy to park at autolib stations i would use that
527975 and i would definitely prefer to drive a car that doesnt pollute
527976 its true that not everyone can afford to buy their own car so it could be very useful

528020 el sistema ferroviario argentino hab a sido devastado estamos haciendo una gran inversi n en materia ferroviaria tambi n es cierto que el precio de la tarifa es poco m s de un peso para tramos largos y esto requiere subsidios muy fuertes por parte del gobierno
528021 que esto quede claro no se saca un solo centavo del presupuesto nacional para estre tren sino que es financiado ntegramente por la empresa que lo construye

528037 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the us hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease
528038 we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective

528099 focusing on legislation in areas previously unexplored by the african american community including his call that a person of color be appointed to the icc
528100 is broken and needs to unite for the common good of the african american community
528101 the problem right now is that we dont have a unified agenda thats enforced back in the community and is clearly articulated everybody tends to be lone agents in these situations
528102 the black caucus is from different tribes different walks of life i dont expect all of the whites to vote alike why is it that all of us should walk alike talk alike and vote alike i was chosen by my constituents to represent them and that is what i try to do
528103 while everyone agrees that the hispanic population has grown they cannot expand by taking african american seats
528104 an incumbent african american legislator with a 90 percent district may feel good about his reelection chances but we as a community would probably be better off if we had two african american legislators with 60 percent each
528105 there is not a black america and a white america and latino america and asian the united states of america
528106 w ere all on the liberal wing of the democratic party
528107 a s you combine a strong african american base with progressive white and latino voters i think it is a recipe for success in the primary and in the general election
528108 when you combine an energized african american voter base and effective coalition building with other progressive sectors of the population we think we have a recipe for victory

528111 when white club owners along with israelis and russians dominated the ecstasy trade thats whom the cops were arresting
528112 racial profiling may explain why incarceration rates are so high among young african americans law enforcement officials may be targeting blacks and other minorities as potential criminals and are using the vehicle code as a tool to stop and search them
528113 it appears that official and public scrutiny of profiling behavior by police can lead to substantial reductions in arrests of minorities although this enforcement reduction may carry the unintended consequence of encouraging crime in minority areas

528155 as urbahns skull showed no sign of a fracture its unlikely he was knocked out before he was stabbed and the sprawled position in which his skeleton was found suggests his hands were not tied behind his back

528157 this left an unbloodied tamihere to drive heidi to tararu creek rd where he subsequently raped and killed her

528197 kde 4 1 is a significant release for the project because 4 0 was controversial for some with its architectural breaks and some quality issues
528198 in that respect this is the service pack 1 equivalent to a windows release while i havent installed it on my kubuntu instance yet 4 1 is generally getting positive reviews and seeing the kinds of reactions youd expect from a follow on update
528199 seeing the reactions to kde 4 0 has hammered home an important message to us as a whole i think its not 2003 anymore and the number of users willing to use linux and try new software has grown enormously
528200 the demographics of our users are different now the message of stick with kde 3 until kde 4 matures enough for you didnt get through loud enough kde 4 1 sends the message kde 4 is mature enough for early adopter desktop users and i think well be putting on the remaining polish to get it to casual users within the kde 4 1 lifespan of about six months
528201 something else that stands out to me and forgive me if it seems trivial but the hovering icons in the startup screen have now had their reflections adjusted to appear all in the same mirror earlier versions had reflections floating around in strange places
528202 a tiny graphical change like that stands out because in general kde 4 is so pretty to look at and so consistent i know theres plenty of grumbling about the looks all i can say is that i like them that a small mistake stands out like that id like to congratulate the artists on their attention to detail even in the face of tremendous work pressure
528203 in a piece i wrote a few years back i echoed marks belief that pretty is a feature obviously there must be substance behind the eye candy but apples ability to wow via its pretty ui is certainly instructive
528204 how those looks are achieved and with what technologies many hold up qt the framework upon which kde is built as the answer because its easier to design good looking applications with it than with gtk gimp tool kit its gnome counterpart but gnome is more popular with enterprises and has a lead in adoption there plus there are licensing issues so its a difficult question to answer
528205 for me on a free software operating system kde succeeds when it doesnt matter what os is underneath it just works regardless and were pretty darn close there

528233 this is part of a systemic problem of the administration and i said im not going to take it anymore
528234 the disdain and uncooperative nature that this administration has shown toward congress is so egregious that i can no longer assume that it is simply bureaucratic incompetence or isolated mistakes rather i have come to the sad conclusion that this administration has intentionally obstructed congress rightful and constitutional duties
528235 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
528236 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
528237 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
528238 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
528239 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
528240 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits
528241 weve always maintained the termination was not related to the union and that there was nothing unlawful about an answer provided an associate about merit pay
528242 following the decision we were considering offering reinstatement but that is on hold since the union appealed the decision

528414 cine te a lovit atat de crunt mantuitorule al meu si cine te supune atator rele chinuri cu adevar spun ca tu esti fara de pacat ci noi si copiii nostri am pacatuit cu nimic nu ai calcat legea eu eu si pacatele mele multe cat nisipul marii ti au pricinuit suferinta la care esti supus si toate chinurile si caznele tale
528415 imagineaza ti ca din acest corp insangerat dupa acest potop pe care revarsarea pacatelor noastre le a dezlantuit apare cel mai frumos curcubeu ca un semn al milei divine
528416 grabiti va suflete chinuite parsiti camerele torturii voastre grabiti va unde spre golgota zburati pe aripile credintei zburati unde spre dealul crucii acolo va inflori mantuirea voastra
528417 eroul iudeii triumfa in a sa putere si pune capat luptei
528418 te topeste inima a mea in revarsare de lacrimi si preamareste pe atotputernicul marturiseste lumii si cerului suferinta iisus al tau a murit
528419 dormiti in pace sfinte oseminte de acum nu va voi mai plange dormiti in pace si aduceti mi pace si mie mormantul care v a cuprins si care nu cunoaste suferinta imi deschide portile raiului si inchide iadul

528441 the high prevalence of mental disorders we observed in these chimpanzees offers a new reason to support proposals to stop using great apes in laboratory experiments
528442 we now know that a chimpanzees mind and emotional well being are affected by experimentation in ways that parallel the psychological trauma experienced by victims of torture and other forms of abuse
528443 it is the failure to develop and validate modern non animal tests that perpetuates the reliance on out dated animal experimentation and when these procedures are carried out on our closest animal relatives people are rightly appalled
528444 there is huge political and public support for a european ban on the use of great apes and dr ferdowsians research makes an already strong case unanswerable

528476 everybody knows who is responsible and why the forests of the region are set on fire
528477 of course it takes many years but oaks can recover from fires however when it comes to junipers this is almost impossible not just the trees but much of the fauna in the forests is destroyed when there is a fire a scientific study recently pointed out that there are some endemic plants and animals in the region that fires are also threatening
528478 it dropped for a while but a couple of years ago the number started to increase again
528479 when there are forest fires in the southeast the military does not allow efforts to put them out claiming that the reason is security they say there might be pkk hideouts in the area when we see the forest fires in the western part of turkey of course we are concerned but we also see the planes and helicopters working to put them out when we compare these two scenarios we definitely feel discriminated against
528480 clear wooded tracts and foliage 50 meters on either side of the railway and the highway
528481 during the summer when the clashes increase in number forest fires also increase in number we are protesting the fact that the fires are being set on purpose we dont want to see our natural environment go up in flames we want peace
528482 the future nature and natural life of turkey are disappearing there are forest fires everywhere but there is an important difference in these fires we know the exact locations and extent of the forest fires in the west but we cannot get satisfactory answers from officials about the forest fires in the east
528483 the state is responsible for the continuation of life of every single living creature an inquiry commission in parliament should be established to investigate these fires

528493 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
528494 were probably holding around 3 000 people you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
528495 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
528496 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
528497 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003
528498 the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
528499 the us may also have kept prisoners on ships within diego garcias territorial waters a contention the us has long denied
528500 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
528501 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the us did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
528502 is a violation of uk law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
528503 a us plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the us facility in diego garcia the detainees did not leave the plane and the us government has assured us that no us detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
528504 neither of the two detainees carried aboard the rendition flights that refuelled at diego garcia was ever part of the cias high value terrorist interrogation program
528505 the united states government confirmed that with the exception of two cases related to diego garcia in 2002 there have been no other instances in which us intelligence flights landed in the united kingdom our overseas territories or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 september 2001
528506 intentionally failed to ask the right questions of the us and accepted implausible us assurances at face value
528507 this remains a transatlantic cover up of epic proportions while the british government seems content to accept whatever nonsense it is fed by its us allies the sordid truth about diego garcias central role in the unjust rendition and detention of prisoners in the so called war on terror cannot be hidden forever
528508 it is deplorable that previous us assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false the failure of the united states administration to tell the truth resulted in the uk government inadvertently misleading our select committee and the house of commons we intend to examine further the extent of uk supervision of us activities on diego garcia including all flights and ships serviced from diego garcia

528520 de voorbije maanden vroeg iedere dag wel iemand wanneer ik mijn laatste wedstrijd zou rijden zaterdag werd ik 38 jaar ik denk dat dit het juiste moment is om afscheid te nemen de voorbije maanden ondervond ik erg veel last van mijn rug die pijn heeft zeker een rol gespeeld in mijn beslissing om een punt achter mijn carri re te zetten
528521 samen met het team heb ik beslist dat desselgem mijn laatste race wordt

528531 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
528532 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
528533 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
528534 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
528535 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
528536 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
528537 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
528538 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
528539 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
528540 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
528541 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
528542 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

528554 of all the players i watched and rooted for during that time i can say without a doubt that andre tippett was the most dominant defender at his position the patriots ever had and one of the greatest ever to play the game
528555 andre possessed the perfect combination of size strength speed and athleticism in his prime andre was probably the most intimidating player in the game i cant think of a higher compliment for a linebacker

528560 yogi is the most popular beloved figure in american sports
528561 baseballs most constant constant over the last sixty some years has been yogi berra

528570 but when you read something thats made for you and you have a point of view about it you have to say yes
528571 i think i really understand men to me women are more of a mystery and theyre more unpredictable i know david kepesh ive met several david kepeshes
528572 this character of the ones ive done in english was maybe the most demanding one emotionally
528573 i didnt learn english until i was 19 years old now finally when im working on a character in my second language im not thinking about the words because ive been spending time there and using the language in the beginning of my career i only knew my dialogue and i was almost learning it phonetically
528574 there are very few films where she can show this raw honesty maybe we can see her in loreal commercials or magazines but i know the woman she really is and i was dying to make this film to show how true she can be portraying someone who i think in a way is close to her
528575 there are two scenes in my life as a filmmaker
528576 you could hear a fly for me as a director as a human being it was a privilege to be a witness of that
528577 its a way to be really close to the actors
528578 and i think to create intimacy you have to perceive how they breathe whats in their eyes you have to really be there with them operating the camera is a way to give them a very strange freedom but a very true freedom
528579 isabel created a special energy on set for us sometimes it was just the three of us and the sound guy nobody else in the room
528580 the problem was that isabel would not stop crying behind the camera making all these noises
528581 each viewer is left to his own devices as to just what is being portrayed and in what context

528587 id like to help artists to create the sound they imagined i had harmonies ideas and that was burning in me
528588 there arent big idols nowadays there arent so many guitar legends in rock back in the sixties there happened to emerge one here or there michael jackson and prince on the other hand were great artists today nothing lasts much because of the world in which we live everything is more dispensable the bands that make success reach this so fast and in a so great way that there is no reason to fight the artist must have hunger for success and for producing great albums a kind of things that can not be fueled by money and success when i work with a band i want to feel this determination sometimes i am difficult and rude to see how people react if they simply go away the band doesnt happen if they face me and listen what i have to say this is more important or as important as the rest a great musician is one thing but you have to have personality for that
528589 i bought a studio and paul weller talked about it to noel galagher one day i received a phone call from the oasis record label to tell you the truth by that time i didnt like them when i heard them i thought they were a terrible copy of the beatles noel came to the studio and he was not particularly pleasant but showed to be a wonderful musician incredibly intelligent he made demos for the following album standing on the shoulder of giants 2000 and played everything drums bass guitar keyboards there is always a reason why a band is successful in this case it was him amid the practice sessions he received a phone call and said liam discovered that we are here the two love and hate each other he said that liam would break everything when liam arrived though he loved the studio he said it looked like jimi hendrixs bedroom because it was a kind of hippie immediately we sympathized with each other at that studio i had oasis bill wyman robbie williams i used to lead them to a pub on the corner liam couldnt take a drink without starting to speak high getting crazy liam and noel have an impressive force but at the time of music as a business they become this strange machine
528590 when i listened to their material i thought it would be a good idea to work with them the songs were not much different from what ive already worked with but they seemed promising

528594 my picture reflects my nightmares of what i must look like with my head double strapped down a tube in my nose a black mask over my mouth with no eyes and only giant cheekbones my teeth jutting out my bones showing in every detail every rib every joint
528595 the tube goes up to a bag at the top of the drawing on the right there is another skeleton sitting shackled to another chair

528597 he explained he felt compelled to express the nightmare that he and the rest of the hunger strikers in guant namo have been suffering samis sketches spoke volumes about what he goes through every time they strap him into that chair for forcefeeding
528598 you have to question i have to question as an american why the us government thinks that free speech in the form of this picture is a somehow a threat to us national security
528599 i have seen plenty of evidence that is extremely embarrassing to the american government and thats because this sort of picture gives you a visual image of what poor sami goes through twice a day
528600 i think a picture sometimes paints a thousand words and i think that is what the us government is afraid of

528607 hate breeds hate the united states said they were doing this to rout out terrorism who is engaged in terrorism now
528608 im very happy to be in sudan but im very sad because of the situation of our brothers who remain in guantanamo conditions in guantanamo are very very bad and they get worse by the day our human condition our human dignity was violated and the american administration went beyond all human values all moral values all religious values in guantanamo you have animals that are called iguanas rats that are treated with more humanity but we have people from more than 50 countries that are completely deprived of all rights and privileges and they will not give them the rights that they give to animals
528609 they hold the quran in contempt destroyed it several times and put their dirty feet on it they also sat on the quran while trying to get us angry they repeatedly committed violations against our dignity and our sexual organs

528628 youd be surprised to know how many good athletes come out of that town
528629 its traditionally known for being loaded with athletes and a lot of division i football players come out of that town
528630 it was so simple back then we were just kids and even though it was organized it was more like playing backyard football
528631 it was too bad he moved away during high school if he would have stuck around we would have been a better team
528632 i played in a bunch of big games four bcs games and two national championship games we didnt win any of them but it was definitely a good experience
528633 we had three big 12 championships and we were the first team to win back to back championships ths past year
528634 in my career we never lost to oklahoma state and they were one of our big rivals
528635 in fact my senior year i probably played my best game ever against them i had a bunch of my family there at the game and i had two touchdowns and blocked really well
528636 after the 49ers called i went on the internet and found out that reggie smith was there and that cody was there i sent cody a text saying i am excited to play with you again then lewis baker called me and said he was coming out here too
528637 i think coach nolan is more calm out here and he really likes to control the tempo of practice
528638 hell tell you exactly what he thinks and hes not going to lie to you he knows how to coach the tight end position and he understands that its one of the hardest positions to play you have to be able to be like a lineman and also like a receiver he does a great job working with us on our technique and our assignments
528639 isaac bruce i watch him run his routes hes the best receiver ive ever seen in person i also learn from even the defensive guys justin smith uses leverage like nobody ive ever seen in my life its a different position but its the same principal as blocking

528659 troubles in the subprime sector seem unlikely to seriously spill over to the broader economy or the financial system
528660 just two months later last august those words seemed a distant memory the financial system was in disarray forcing the fed and the european central bank to pump more than 250 billion into short term funding markets to keep them working properly the subprime mortgage crisis had gone global and the credit crunch had begun
528661 as the first anniversary of the crisis arrives this coming week the dow jones industrial average is down 14 u s economic growth has more than halved financial institutions have suffered 350 billion in write downs and fired chief executives and thousands of workers while house prices have slumped as much as 40 in some areas bear stearns the nations fifth largest investment bank had to be bailed out by the fed and j p morgan chase fannie mae and freddie mac the bedrock of the u s mortgage market may be next
528662 the government should not be involved in bailing out financial companies that have taken risks incompatible with their survival
528663 this might all go very quickly if the government asks society to take responsibility for the troubles it brought upon itself
528664 but instead the government is creating dollars left and right to manipulate the economy into a better showing in the short term
528665 such action will create longer term problems such as further drop in the u s dollar and rampant inflation burry said
528666 but policymakers probably had no choice without the bailout of bear stearns and plans to support fannie and freddie there may have been a catastrophic economic slump scms bublitz argues
528667 hands off government sounds great in theory but who knows what it would be like without such support
528668 bailouts while repugnant to some just had to happen because the alternatives were too dire
528669 the credit crunch could be eased sooner if a major investor steps up by borrowing more money and using that to buy trouble assets from financial institutions paul mcculley managing director of fixed income giant pimco wrote in a july note to investors
528670 that entity should be the u s government he said
528671 otherwise financial institutions will continue to cut leverage and sell assets into a market of few buyers this in turn will drive prices lower again pressuring firms into more de leveraging and more asset sales mcculley explained
528672 the federal government needs to lever up its balance sheet to absorb assets being shed through private sector de levering so as to avoid pernicious asset deflation
528673 a structure similar to the resolution trust corporation or rtc has been suggested by some economists bublitz noted

528682 satellite images dating back to 1973 and old maps earlier than that show some 1 000 square kilometres of land have risen from the sea
528683 a rise in sea level will offset this and slow the gains made by new territories but there will still be an increase in land we think that in the next 50 years we may get another 1 000 square kilometres of land
528684 for almost a decade we have heard experts saying bangladesh will be under water but so far our data has shown nothing like this
528685 natural accretion has been going on here for hundreds of years along the estuaries and all our models show it will go on for decades or centuries into the future
528686 the land bangladesh has lost so far has been caused by river erosion which has always happened in this country natural accretion due to sedimentation and dams have more than compensated this loss
528687 if we build more dams using superior technology we may be able to reclaim 4 000 to 5 000 square kilometres in the near future

528766 since keatings collapse you find yourself doing obscene things to save yourself from the senate ethics committees investigation as a matter of course you engage in backbiting behavior that will turn you into an outcast in the senate if you do survive
528767 those who survive will be the sociopaths who can tell a lie with the most sincere straight face you john mccain are especially adept at this
528768 mccain sold your fame for charles keatings money it was a faustian bargain it was also a bad joke on the rest of us and a disaster for many old people who lost their lifes savings to keating

528812 you must always keep in mind that a path is only a path if you feel you should not follow it you must not stay with it under any conditions to have such clarity you must lead a disciplined life only then will you know that any path is only a path and there is no affront to oneself or to others in dropping it if that is what your heart tells you to do but your decision to keep on the path or to leave it must be free of fear or ambition i warn you look at every path closely and deliberately try it as many times as you think necessary then ask yourself and yourself alone one question i will tell you what it is does this path have heart all paths are the same they lead nowhere they are paths going through the bush or into the bush in my own life i could say i have traversed long long paths but i am not anywhere does this path have heart if it does the path is good if it doesnt it is of no use both paths lead nowhere but one has heart the other doesnt one makes for a joyful journey as long as you follow it you are one with it the other will make you curse your life one makes you strong the other weakens you

528895 the eight days on my hut trip were perhaps the best eight days of my life for a place to sleep and food for 7 days and 6 nights the price was totally reasonable better than lugging a tent

528913 we have always adopted a wise and prudent management that is the key to our success
528914 the cooperatives performance was outstanding we did fantastically in our first year and the dividend paid out was 100 percent
528915 last year we more than doubled our profit and it is just fair that the dividend was also doubled
528916 we owe our success mostly to permodalan kelantan bhd which leases us our pawn broking licences and rents the five buildings we own
528917 when we paid out 300 per cent the share capital of members was only rm100 which means they each got rm300
528918 this time although the share capital has been increased to rm200 they are only getting rm350 each
528919 forty per cent of our income comes from the pawn broking licences and 20 per cent from the rental of buildings cyber clout
528920 the cooperatives will take over the upkeep of the apartments rent out lots for the apartments grocery store and decide how to use land in their area
528921 kobera is one form of mechanism for co ops to create activities to generate income among the poor
528922 each kobera will be given rm30 000 as capital for business and the co op will be led by the local community leader like penghulu or a state assemblyman
528923 it works like a mentoring programme we place smaller co ops under a bigger more successful co op or private business entity which would act as an anchor to create business opportunities like contract farming or buy back guarantee
528924 we want the co ops to focus only on what they are good at for instance in planting processing or distribution depending on the strengths and expertise within their co op
528925 this means that 75 per cent of our co ops remain in the micro category they would need to be groomed to grow bigger increasing their capabilities in terms of management and business development
528926 the government aims to up their gdp contribution to 10 per cent its not impossible
528927 in new zealand cooperatives contribute 22 per cent to the gdp cyber clout
528928 we cant let them fail because they contribute 80 per cent of the annual total turnover of cooperatives in the country
528929 if all of them fail the industry will collapse and a lot of people will suffer
528930 we dont want another fiasco of the deposit taking cooperatives dtcs of the 1980s
528931 we need to protect members interest by making sure that the leader is trustworthy and possesses integrity
528932 we keep an eye on such schemes and monitor the media including the internet to detect such schemes
528933 some may be genuine but we dont want to take chances
528934 the due diligence examination is not to find fault with the management
528935 we tell them in advance before we audit their management practices and look at their books
528936 we will evaluate them and tell them of our findings and give recommendations before we rate them this is more so for larger cooperatives
528937 it is splendid news depending of course on what the criteria are im sure theyll be tough
528938 it will improve the transparency and efficiency of the cooperative movement a lot of people put in their names and they dont do a thing
528939 they have the right to choose who they want to lead them
528940 thats why we wanted to establish this so that theres a collection of money to cover them if they get into trouble its like an insurance scheme
528941 for example the deposits they collect from the members are their liability so they would have to contribute up to three per cent of this to the clf
528942 i know some cooperatives are not happy with this but this is because they dont understand the principle behind it
528943 even if they put money into fds fixed deposits the returns only average three to four per cent a year
528944 under the cda they can get higher returns as we will appoint professional managers to manage the funds
528945 but its going to be managed by people of calibre it is a good idea im in favour of it
528946 a co op which has excess funds is a failed co op why because youre meant to use those funds for your activities
528947 so if youre keeping those funds and not using them productively then theres something wrong with the way youre running the co op
528948 cooperatives exist because members face a dearth of capital of cash flow
528949 if the money they collect to ease their finances is taken away what is the point of setting up the cooperative
528950 this person doesnt seem to regret hes showing his face everywhere
528951 looks like me and sounds like me but its not me
528952 i married my husband i know hes not a saint but hes a good husband a good family man
528953 we get elected mca leaders who are not true leaders because they dont have popular support
528954 we do not believe in this artificial game that the radicals play of pitting the so called bad energy versus good energy all energy when prices are as high as they are which is such a critical resource and the lifeblood of a nations economy and the survival of people is good energy as far as we are concerned
528955 being cowered by a very powerful well funded environmental extremist lobby that has a great deal of influence over them and a great deal of influence over policy
528956 anything that is produced here or close to us will help reduce prices and help the overall agenda to stop the war on the poor and bring costs down
528957 specific doctrines of hatred that seize hold of young peoples imagination
528958 the things that are most dangerous is when religious fanaticism becomes the motivating force in their lives and thats what gives rise to this terrorism
528959 terrorism is not just restricted to islam but when there is more understanding and education there will be less ignorance less hate and less conflict
528960 when people get taught what is a perversion of the proper faith of islam which is that christians are your enemies then that is damaging
528961 theres a lot of ignorance i have come across in teachings about islam for example that are shocking surprising and not helpful at all likewise theres a misunderstanding about what christians and jews believe

528968 the prime minister asked to consider reviving agriculture related programmes as during his school days abdullah said agriculture clubs were active and useful
528969 the hospital was muddy the planks too shaky to walk on and the mothers had no safe place to deliver their babies
528970 we believe that this kind of political affiliation restricts the development of students into holistic first class human capital
528971 the rational is simple by joining political parties students will have to subscribe to a partys ideology and policies
528972 so if a student chooses to join a political party he or she will have to adhere to the policies advocated by the partys leaders and will not be allowed to offer opinions on issues raised independently
528973 this is a waste of talent and not beneficial to students who should seek to learn the most during this period of life
528974 in fact under this amendment we allow members of the opposition party to be invited to and participate in any intellectual discourse at public universities
528975 the members of the council had tabled their views rationally to find solutions to issues and challenges related to the society and nation
528976 the country is rich in diversity and we must celebrate it as our strength malaysias main objective is the development of unity
528977 so young leaders must incorporate the countrys multicultural elements in their aspirations to build the nation
528978 we are doing everything we can to reflect the true racial composition of malaysia in the civil service
528979 true we dont have enough non malays in some areas still we have other mechanisms to include the views of non malays in our policy making process
528980 when vision 2020 was formulated it was based on an annual gdp gross domestic product growth of six per cent per annum
528981 due to the two major global issues we are having some difficulties achieving this growth the country has to deal with inflation
528982 i have made several statements on these matters and changes are underway
528983 we have also started reforms for the police force and we will continue with our efforts to keep up with the ever changing times
528984 we have also instituted reforms in the financial and educational sectors
528985 we do not want to be like some states in africa the nation must be developed for every malaysian
528986 there must also be equitable distribution of wealth and education
528987 if such efforts are not made proton may need to enter into a partnership with a car company that is stronger and more capable
528988 these vehicles are also increasingly being produced by other automobile manufacturers
528989 the hybrid car now undergoing tests looks good it is now up to proton to decide when to sell it
528990 i am a big fan of proton and i want to see them among the top automobile producers in the world
528991 they must remember it is their workers who make it happen
528992 this agreement is testament to the level of automotive technology that proton has achieved
528993 umno is simply wasting its precious time i believe it will be better for umno to concentrate its efforts on strengthening the party
528994 instead of talking to pas i believe a better bet for some form of unity will be if umno were to talk to parti keadilan rakyat it will be easier to sit and talk with them on the malay muslim agenda
528995 we need to look at the average price this month and it is unlikely the price will drop by as much as 50 sen
528996 i have instructed the labour department to facilitate quicker hearing of such cases
528997 we want to create a mechanism where the cases are cleared much faster we want to make sure the cases are settled within three months
528998 for domestic workers certain clauses in the employment act do not apply to them because of the rather different type of job they do and the fact that they stay in their place of employment
528999 but we are overcoming this by creating provisions in the act so that the terms and conditions will be clarified in the contract between the worker and employer
529000 these will include salary compensation days off working hours and any other things relating to their work
529001 imagine solving all cases within three months the crux of the matter will not be dealt with
529002 justice cannot be rushed but at the same time it cannot be delayed for three years
529003 the due process of the law must treat local and foreigners equally
529004 today is my special day i have someone to celebrate my birthday tomorrow he is very nice and good he treats me and loves me very well he is a very good man not like my ex he is very special this is the most happy thing trach lon gian i give all the space in my heart to you
529005 i was about 7 then and i didnt have the foggiest idea where the place was
529006 maybe i was too young to appreciate what my father was telling me
529007 it was an introductory kind of thing i remember my father laying the old sarawak flag on the floor of the sitting room for me to see
529008 then he would take out all the old swords and shields that he had brought back home from sarawak
529009 and he would go through the hundreds of photos to show the family connection with this faraway place
529010 i may not have understood much of what was told but my interest was stirred
529011 i probably read every book there was on sarawak i quizzed my grandfather my father and other family members on their recollection of sarawak
529012 i had this picture of kuching before i came i already knew what i was looking for
529013 even though kuching was bigger than i imagined the old buildings that i had seen in my family photographs and in the books are as they were
529014 the old courthouse the astana the general post office and fort margherita are exactly like what ive seen in the books and photos
529015 it was quite moving i never expected to see the coat of arms there
529016 it was very interesting to get a first hand account from them of the family in the old days
529017 i would like to see as much of sarawak as possible but i know that i will have no time
529018 my father would probably like to come back too he lived here in kuching when he was a baby but he had not been back all his adult life
529019 we have forwarded this information to the domestic trade and consumer affairs ministry international trade and industry ministry and the finance ministry to study the possibility of setting a limit to exports or at least a quota
529020 the government wants to push the housing sector forward by providing incentives such as lowering stamp duties
529021 for those who believe no explanation is necessary for those who do not believe no explanation is possible
529022 failure to build community is one of the many reasons so many newspapers are in so much trouble right now
529023 with the amount of ads papers carry i dont see why end users need to be charged at all it should be at most a token fee
529024 the council felt that with the presence of foreign players local players have not been given the opportunity to develop
529025 we are back at the drawing board our focus now will be development
529026 we are not at the status of english premier league epl our league is not matured yet therefore some drastic measures must be taken to improve it
529027 many states are having problems paying of salaries and they cant cope so it is best that we do away with foreign players until the problems are solved
529028 based solely on the report and criticism of this one civil society group in this country
529029 although it is not compulsory states are encouraged to have a broad consultation with stakeholders
529030 so much so that states have taken it as mandatory and it is now almost a convention
529031 when malaysia wanted to get elected into the unhrc it made commitments and pledges one of which was good governance so that would include being consultative
529032 even if we put in 10 reports of 10 pages each the bottom line is we will end up with five pages
529033 the ohchr being in geneva will have to use their discretion and understanding of local issues to decide on which issues to pick
529034 its important to have as few reports as possible so that we pick what the issues are
529035 desaru is proving to be a challenging and very bumpy rally so we had to be careful and not go as fast as we had liked
529036 the third special stage ss is tricky because it starts out very fast and suddenly narrows down and becomes twisty and this is challenging for bigger cars like ours
529037 unfortunately there was a culvert covered by the bush which we had not spotted during the race and we fell straight into it
529038 it has been so far a pretty decent weekend and the team have done a great job in improving the car again even from the last race
529039 the pace of our car is great and it is a great day to have me and heikki one two
529040 it is about time we did that for the team and weve both done a great job it is very satisfying
529041 we were quick in testing yesterday q2 looked a bit close but it was tyre dependent and we made the right choice at the end so i am very happy
529042 you can never be too comfortable for sure but i feel safe to be in the position i am in
529043 we have speed to push on and challenge for the win tomorrow today is another day and ill make sure i do the preparations tonight and tomorrow morning
529044 i did not jump today because the weather was very hot and it was not conducive
529045 i need to look after my health in view of the olympics

529049 i am not going anywhere i am here and intend to see the job through we have great expectations and i hope that i am able to fulfill them
529050 i hope that maybe we can try and get together in the next week or two and sort something out
529051 we learned from last week it was a learning experience for us all particularly for the coaches
529052 we changed our pattern and our kicking game paid dividends we took our opportunities this week and that last bonus point try was just the icing on the cake
529053 it was a pretty good performance from the all blacks
529054 they built pressure and they profited from that and didnt allow us to build pressure and they grew in confidence
529055 we came up a distant second here and we have some downtime before we go to africa and look forward to that opportunity
529056 it was a tough match and rachael played well i had to tighten my rallies and get into my game more before she began to make some errors
529057 i expected a few surprises but maybe not as early as the first round we are all still getting used to the new system
529058 ill be taking a short break before returning to training for the dutch open that will be my build up towards the world open and and i just hope to keep my game going and bring everything together for the two tournaments
529059 at the end it was a case of calculating the distance and the timing and i got it right
529060 i have an appointment to fulfil a dream to be in the olympics
529061 yesterday i drove the ball and couldnt miss a fairway and today i couldnt find one so that was a big difference
529062 i felt very comfortable on the tee i just dont know what happened it just didnt go straight today but my iron play was the same and i putted decent
529063 i feel much much better with the putter much better with the wedges
529064 i hit some great wedge shots today just the basic little chip shots that i expect to get close
529065 i havent been performing the way i expected and this week it feels much better i spent last week on short game exclusively and i feel like its starting to come around
529066 our leaders idea of promoting alternative energy is touting future nonexistent technologies and that false savior ethanol ethanol consumes nearly as much fuel to make as it produces while collaterally raising food prices and damaging the environment
529067 not a lot are expected to be cut from newsroom

529072 payne youve been caught on hidden camera taking bribes from people who want access to our top players

529074 officials e mails city payroll files confidential law enforcement documents and jail inmates bookings
529075 city officials said late monday that they had made some headway into cracking his pass codes and regaining access to the system
529076 im in it software development specifically and things are great
529077 i am sure that sultan azlan shah is saddened by the present deterioration of the sport in the country
529078 my instruction was to play an attacking game from the midfield onwards and the boys proved that they can do it
529079 this team can only get better with more emphasis on fitness i believe they will give every team in division one a fight
529080 just this week alone azizul has done a personal best in the standing start i myself have done a personal best in training as well rizal tisin is also absolutely flying
529081 our health is all good and there have not been any injuries
529082 azizuls injury was only a rumour it was actually just a tight itb iliotibial band a muscle on the outside of the thigh which is a normal occurrence among sprinters
529083 although i had been concentrating on the fei world cup showjumping sea league im glad to have finished the overall champion in the dressage event
529084 it will be extremely painful for everyone billions of ringgit would have been wasted in teacher training reprinting textbooks and formulating courseware and teaching aids it would all have been a sheer waste of money and time
529085 but now we dont know what is going to happen teachers do not appreciate being made guinea pigs it is disturbing when programmes implemented are reversed just because politicians disagree with them
529086 if the policy is reversed the government will be rectifying the mistake it made in 2003
529087 many students think in their mother tongue they would need to be adept in the language used in teaching in order to be able to learn content oriented subjects like science mathematics and geography if they cannot grasp the language they cannot master the subjects
529088 only a handful of pupils can overcome this language barrier this is not right as education should apply for all not just this specific group of pupils
529089 many have dropped out because they cannot cope with the language
529090 malay pupils especially those in the rural areas are worse off
529091 if children in rural schools are struggling maybe we should allocate more time for the teaching of mathematics science and also english to allow them to gain confidence in this medium of instruction
529092 a one size fits all implementation model especially with regard to textbooks and teaching aids may not be appropriate given the differing competency levels between urban and rural children
529093 attention towards these types of issues will be better than a complete policy reversal
529094 governments can no longer say they subscribe to the rule of law and yet compromise on the issues of human rights
529095 of the 7 800 teachers in tamil schools fewer than 500 are trained to teach in english if ministry officials go to the ground they will see that teachers are teaching the subjects in tamil
529096 in one school of the 28 teachers only two are graduates but even then both cannot string two sentences together in english without making a mistake
529097 the government should stick with it english is an essential language now and this policy is beneficial the ministry just needs to implement it properly
529098 this is true for schools in rural areas if pupils are left far behind they will not be able to catch up no matter how good the teachers are
529099 there should be dialogues and feedback from all concerned parties parents teachers and experts before effecting a change discussions should come before a major policy change not in between or after
529100 even though i would love to have one but i might forget to replace the cap and have ink all over my shirt pocket
529101 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors
529102 probability of success in actually overthrowing any government is close to zero
529103 hes always on the honor system all of our employees are
529104 well have to work sort of the dark side if you will weve got to spend time in the shadows in the intelligence world a lot of what needs to be done here will have to be done quietly without any discussion using sources and methods that are available to our intelligence agencies if we are going to be successful thats the world these folks operate in and uh so its going to be vital for us to use any means at our disposal basically to achieve our objectives
529105 i am tonight setting a clear goal for the energy policy of the united states beginning this moment this nation will never use more foreign oil than we did in 1977 never
529106 however the competition which development of a modern steam powered vehicle has to consider is not so much from gasoline powered cars as from electric hydrogen powered and hybrid vehicles

529108 mccain was the guy who came up with the whole idea for this penicillin thing
529109 this war diminishes our security our standing in the world our military our economy and the resources that we need to confront the challenges of the 21st century
529110 by any measure our single minded and open ended focus on iraq is not a sound strategy for keeping america safe
529111 because if you know anything about winning wars you know that once you find a strategy that seems to have worked in one place its bound to operate every bit as well in the next place
529112 a democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government it can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves money from the public treasury from that moment on the majority always votes for the candidate promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy always followed by dictatorship

529193 he said he because he wanted congress to act first
529194 the only thing standing between the american people and these vast oil resources is action from the u s congress
529195 now the only thing standing between consumers at the pump and the increased american energy they are demanding is the democrat leadership in congress
529196 if offshore drilling would provide short term relief at the pump or a long term strategy for energy independence it would be worthy of our consideration regardless of the risks
529197 senator obama believes americans need real short term relief which is why he has proposed a second round of stimulus with energy rebates for working families and over the long term senator obama understands that our national security and the survival of the planet demand a real strategy to break our dependence on foreign oil by developing clean new sources of energy and by vastly improving the energy efficiency of our cars trucks and our economy he is ready to lead such a transformation
529198 hey dems wont let us drill and its hurting your familys finances
529199 why bush lifted the coastal drilling ban and why it doesnt matter

529201 as part of its cost cutting gm plans to eliminate health care coverage for u s salaried retirees older than 65 effective jan 1
529202 its them goddamn democrats and tree huggers who wont let us drill and lower the price at the pump they hate america
529203 this wont give us any oil in the short term
529204 what are you people doing the next thing you know well be drilling for oil offshore
529205 what are you people doing the next thing you know well be drilling for oil offshore
529206 from now on we only buy tickets nothing else also were not going to watch the pre movie ads anymore

529217 the air conditioners theyre more designed for like 95 degrees
529218 and when it gets above that people think they may not be working as well as they should be and sometimes theyre doing all they can for the home
529219 it was a little uncomfortable especially at night trying to go to sleep
529220 it would take a little while for the air conditioner to catch back up once the sun went down last night it was still 83 degrees up there at midnight
529221 they want us to get that air conditioner running and get it up and going just as quickly as we can and get it cooled down in that house
529222 if we are working up in the attics then well take a lot of breaks come down and get some cooler air
529223 cars have to stop for a bicyclist or pedestrian in a trail crossing
529224 bicyclists do not have the right of way at trail crossings
529225 state law requires all trail users to stop and yield to vehicles
529226 in minneapolis we are definitely asking that motor vehicles do stop we want them to stop for bicyclists and pedestrians in a trail crossing
529227 all the rights and duties applicable to a pedestrian under the same circumstances

529236 i think theres a lot of pride i think theres a lot of excitement so yeah theres that whole celebrity part of it but i think everybody sort of adopts her as their own because she is from michigan and that really adds to a lot of it

529239 i had a whole lot less tolerance for the gifted and a whole lot more tolerance for the guy that wasnt quite as gifted
529240 with johnny i saw him struggle to walk struggle to kick a ball struggle to do everything that he did so i had a little tolerance for the guys that had to struggle if you had talent and didnt lay it on the line i didnt have much tolerance for you the less talented guy cant play on saturdays but he can get you ready to play on saturdays i wanted the guys who played on saturday to have an appreciation for that guy who got them there
529241 theres another level below the surface which is the kind of stuff that comes out tumbles out before we have a chance to think about it our snap decisions our first impressions
529242 one of the big ideas in psychology recently has been that level that second level is really important in how we behave how we think and how we feel are really important in things like prejudice and discrimination
529243 in other words i was biased slightly biased against black people which horrified me because my moms jamaican
529244 the person in my life who i love almost more than anyone else is black and here i was taking a test which said frankly i wasnt too crazy about black people
529245 love is when you look into someones eyes and see everything you need
529246 when i saw your mom dad shaking her his thing on the dance floor with that half drunk glow in her his eyes i knew
529247 but you should know that i still hate women so does your husband gotta go late for class
529248 some days it would be great to drop it all at 5 like you do im jealous
529249 im pleased with how our whole team did we came out here and competed really well
529250 all in all there were some good points the touchdown to keller was nice it showcased his abilities a little bit
529251 as im watching this game part of it is watching those guys but part of it is watching all the other new guys part of it is trying to look at the scheme and how those guys are executing the scheme theres a lot of new faces to look at thats really going to come more from the tape than this first look
529252 i just thought the group as a whole did what i was looking for them to do in terms of tempo and effort
529253 kellen put the ball right where it needed to be so there was no thinking or looking back after that
529254 im fine but im not at liberty to discuss injuries
529255 obviously the biggest reason they brought me here was to upgrade the pass rush so that is one of the things i have to get used to
529256 through the google goggles is remarkably sapient siva vaidhyanathan authored a terrific cultural critique of google library in the
529257 the clash between the rat and the horse is a serious clash between water and fire
529258 for people born in the year of the horse it is recommended that they wear a pendant of an ox which will help to attract away the rat so as to minimize the influence of the clash
529259 the traditional belief is that you need an animal to attract away the rat
529260 according to the calendar it is an auspicious day there is nothing wrong with choosing this date it still represents a positive energy
529261 if you pick a good day this indicates a smooth beginning to the marriage
529262 you can see water trouble will be stronger in the second half of the year because of these seasonal elements
529263 for example the tsunami took place in december in 2004 usually water is more powerful in the months after august
529264 as far as the mark spitz thing goes ive said this before and ill say it again
529265 i want to be the first michael phelps and not the second mark spitz
529266 i dont mean to downplay his accomplishments by any means for what he did it was and still is the greatest olympic performance of all time
529267 he will always be remembered as one of the great olympians of all time im just lucky that i can be in a position to hopefully do something different to him
529268 who knows what will happen in beijing time will tell

529271 this year has been up and down ive had some life changing experiences and been able to get through them and get here
529272 im swimming well feeling good in the water and im ready to compete
529273 its important to stop that kind of momentum when we get into a little rut
529274 hes proven it hes just had a tough time this year it was nice to see him win monday night thats what weve been looking for hopefully its a turning point
529275 weve talked about this for years getting a chance to do this i never thought it would actually happen so many things in the big leagues have to line up to be on the same team as your brother this is great
529276 we just felt like he wasnt making the progression that we thought he would and ultimately it came down to taking innings away from some guys who we feel need it
529277 we tried to be as patient as we could during this process and i can tell you he worked extremely hard to get back but in the end it just wasnt there
529278 it just was more or less kind of the overall picture we didnt think was going to help us get to where we wanted to be
529279 he was trending up at times but he never was able to sustain it

529300 zak has got a real good feel for getting through traffic and getting on linebackers and dbs as a blocker

529473 hundreds of visionary drawings really spiritual messages in pictorial form
529474 the designers of these symbolic documents felt their work was controlled by supernatural agencies gifts bestowed on some individual in the order usually not the one who made the drawing
529475 to be sure the term drawing is a misnomer because the shakers did not use it themselves when they were referring to these works in the few shaker documents in which the gift drawings are mentioned they are typically referred to as sheets rolls signs notices tokens of love presents rewards hearts sometimes prefaced by the adjective sacred this definition focuses on the function of the works as gifts from heavenly spirits rather than on the form in which the gifts were materialized in fact the gift drawings often include titles captions inscriptions and extended texts in english as well as in scripts written in indecipherable tongues that place them on an uninterrupted continuum with other manifestations of belief such as inspired writing ecstatic movement and spontaneous speech especially in the form of song
529476 the shaker drawings are documents of visions taking a physical form that is in most instances highly contained and organized nonetheless within this ordering are chaotic details and decorations flourishes of line and color as well as indecipherable texts and alternately those that read with heart stopping clarity a vision seen or heard by one shaker member as a divine manifestation is then transcribed by another assaulting on several fronts the modern notion of authorship whether intentionally or not the shakers contradicted many traditional notions of art making just as the relative freedom afforded them in their chosen home the united states allowed them to pursue a rigorous life of communal devotion very unlike the cult of the individual that the new country promulgated
529477 which were set to music from about 1840 on were like prose poems which conformed however to no metrical pattern and could be sung only because shaker notation allowed constant changes in mode timing barring or rhythm others written into hymnals with no musical accompaniment were probably chanted or recited if used in meeting at all
529478 gift drawings are also typically distinguished by their precise graphic quality which links words elegantly written in upright noble scripts with their delicately rendered visual counterparts as unified elements of thoroughly structured designs
529479 in 1853 visiting spirits dancing in twisting circles were seen and recorded by timothy randlett at enfield new hampshire images of circular dances were produced in various publications
529480 the gift drawing the narrow path to zion executed by emily babcock about 1843 was about eight and one half feet long it depicts the walking of the narrow path at the end of the row of lines are rewarding fruit trees and brick walls of zion over which hover angels along the path leading to this goal are instruments of mortification that seekers could experience believers could use the tools for self inflicted pain to further them on the way to salvation or evil people or satan could use them to cause believers pain and disruption surviving the struggle produced martyrs and saints although the eight sheets that comprise the drawings are now separate they were once attached to each other by narrow strips of glued paper in 1844 a seventeen foot long scroll was unrolled on a bench during worship in the watervliet meeting house it had been written by inspiration amp in hiragliphics about a year since

529532 it was a disarming joke by obama which no one noticed until the mccain people brought it up but obama opened the door and they drove right through it
529533 they clearly think they will get some benefit because whenever race comes up it is bad for obama it risks making him appear to be the black candidate when he is more than that
529534 its a strategic decision because they recognise they cant win based on the issues like the economy

529540 i recount all this now because it illustrates the perverse nature of fannie and freddie that has made them such a relentless and untouchable political force the abiding lesson here is what happens when you combine private property with government power you create political monsters that are protected both by journalists on the left and pseudo capitalists on wall street by liberal democrats and country club republicans even now after all the dishonesty and failure fannie and freddie could emerge from this taxpayer rescue more powerful than ever
529541 fan and fred also couldnt prosper for as long as they have without the support of the political left both in congress and the intellectual class this includes mr frank and sen chuck schumer d n y on capitol hill as well as mr krugman and the washington posts steven pearlstein in the press yet as studies have shown about half of the implicit taxpayer subsidy for fan and fred is pocketed by shareholders and management according to the federal reserve the half that goes to homeowners adds up to a mere seven basis points on mortgages in return for this fannie was able to pay no fewer than 21 of its executives more than 1 million in 2002 and in 2003 mr raines pocketed more than 20 million fannies left wing defenders are underwriters of crony capitalism not affordable housing
529542 taxpayer are on the hook this is incorrect the agencies debt is not guaranteed by the u s treasury or any agency of the federal government

529576 sexuele omgang buiten het huwelijk dus buiten een rechtsgeldige verbintenis is volgens sant mat absoluut verwerpelijk
529577 wanneer 2 mensen als man en vrouw willen samenleven dienen zij zich volgens de wetten en gebruiken van het land waarin ze wonen in de echt te laten verbinden
529578 een satsangi legt bij de inwijding de kuisheidsgelofte af hij mag mey niemand anders dan met zijn huwelijkspartner sexuele ongang hebben een zodanige handeling is zondig en verhindert automatisch elke spirituele vooruitgang daardoor verkommert de geest wordt hem alle kracht ontnomen en het gevolg is algemeen bekend
529579 sexualiteit is een enorme kracht de beste manier om daarmee in het reine te komen is deze niet te onderdrukken maar te sublimeren
529580 sexuele kracht is zeer nuttig wanneer ze getransformeerd d w z naar binnen gekeerd en aangewnd wordt voor dimran en bhajan dat is de ware transformatie van het lagere naar het hogere zelf het is een dwaling te denken dat dit ook op een andere manier bereikt kan worden dat zou ons slechts van het voordeel van deze energie beroven
529581 hoe zou men van iemand die het sant mat pad wil volgen kunnen aannemen dat hij geen hoge mate van moraliteit nodig zou hebben daar hij immers bij de inwijding moest beloven een rein en hoog moreel leven te zullen leiden is het leven van een satsangi niet volkomen kuis en boven elke twijfel verheven dan is spirituele vooruitgang voor hem absoluut onmogelijk zwakheid in dit opzicht is een grote hinderpaal op deze weg en dient met wortel en tak te worden uitgeroeid
529582 goed gezelschap morele en geestverheffende literatuur zij zeer nuttig maar het doen van simran is de meest werkzame methode langdurige en standvastige simran zal de geest uiteindelijk naar binnen doen keren en hem met de shabd of logos verbinden shabd is het middel en als men gegint van de goddelijke melodie te genieten dan zal men automatisch de zinsgeneugten vergeten
529583 ik kan niet genoeg de nadruk leggen op het belang van het leiden van een onberispelijk zedelijk leven
529584 het zou een dwaling zijn aan te nemen dat men omdat men satsangi is zich niet aan de zedenwtten noch aan de 10 geboden zou hebben te houden
529585 ik heb niets tegen baarden maar laten we wat onze uiterlijke verschijning betreft niet uit de toon vallen
529586 wees een goed burger maar laat dit je niet verhinderen je ware leven te leven natuurlijk niet in egoisyische zin maar in die van het feitelijke doel van ons bestaan n
529587 het is van wezenlijk belang dat wij een loopbaan hebben of een beroep uitoefenen waardoor wij in ons levensonderhoud kunnen voorzien maar aan de andere kant dienen wij ons niet in die mate daarmee bezig te houden dat ons spiritueel streven wordt geschaad in india zegt men
529588 de handen voor het werk de geest voor de ware guru
529589 het zijn van vegetarier is in sant mat miet slechts een formaliteit maar een principieel beginsel waarop onder geen voorwaarde een uitzondering kan worden gemaakt

529611 there was a huge disconnect with the person i showed on the outside and the person who suffered inside
529612 and then i realized it was hypocritical of me to expect their forgiveness if i could not forgive those who hurt me
529613 it doesnt cost anything and its better than any medicine
529614 this inner place of forgiveness and peace is available to everyone
529615 we didnt know then we dont know today what was in them
529616 i discovered for myself i had the power to forgive
529617 no one could take it from me it became a gift to myself as well because i realized i was not a powerless victim
529618 i became free i remain free i will never again be a victim
529619 when i meet with people trying so hard to transform themselves it gives me great hope
529620 i was really nervous after i had a bad run in the qualifier
529621 and it was even worse when i got to the top and saw that it had been raining up there which i knew would make it slippery my run was pretty good but i made some mistakes i just knew that it was important to never give up
529622 the track is a lot shorter than mont ste anne last weekend
529623 but it is just as tiring its super technical and i was cautious because there were a lot of places you could crash on the track but it went pretty well for me

529625 i wanted to just put together a good run and try for the race win it was a tough course all the way down and there were lots of places to make mistakes so i just tried to be smooth and consistent all the way down

529628 to have him teaching science at a respectable school is about equivalent to having a flat earther teaching geography
529629 could be discussed in schools in the context of being one of a range of views on evolution
529630 what is not fine is to say there are these two theories one is called evolution the other is called genesis if you are going to say that then you should talk about the nigerian tribe who believe the world was created from the excrement of ants
529631 most devout muslims are creationists so when you go to schools there are a large number of children of islamic parents who trot out what they have been taught
529632 i was shocked by how some put up barriers to understanding
529633 i showed them the evidence and they just said this is what it says in my holy book and so i asked if your holy book says one thing but the evidence says something else you then go with your holy book and they said yes and i said why and they said its the way weve been brought up
529634 teachers are bending over backwards to respect home prejudices that children have been brought up with
529635 the government could do more but it doesnt want to because it is fanatical about multi culturalism and the need to respect the different traditions from which these children come the government particularly under tony blair thinks it is wonderful to have children brought up with their traditional religions i call it brainwashing
529636 i would like to see evolution taught a lot earlier there should be no problem teaching it to eight year olds
529637 for parents to deprive their children of an educational opportunity because of a traditional bigotry is unfair on the child
529638 it seems as though teachers are terribly frightened of being thought racist
529639 its almost impossible to say anything against islam in this country because if you do you are accused of being racist or islamophobic
529640 i have a lot of time for the church of england
529641 i feel rather sorry for them in a way compared to the alternatives it is a thoroughly decent organisation and if all christians were like rowan there wouldnt be a problem ive met him socially and he is delightful
529642 when i go to dinner with a bishop i find them very often extremely often very convivial nice people why ever not
529643 often when you talk to bishops it appears they dont believe in very much
529644 it would appear he does believe in it the virgin birth
529645 but he doesnt thrust it down peoples throats his kind of anglicanism is benign and pretty harmless
529646 because we are all brought up to respect faith it leaves open a gap through which fanatics can charge
529647 yes i think we have all been brought up to give too much respect to religion as opposed to any other kind of opinion
529648 well we devote our lives to writing books composing music creating poetry all higher functions of the brain if we were following darwinian dictates we males would be spending all our time fighting other males to get females and screwing them all over the place in order to have lots of children and grandchildren im very glad we have risen above all of that
529649 from numerous accounts it has not been uncommon for board members or former superintendents to contact administrative staff regarding a board members desire to have relatives hired or the relative or child of a community member
529650 they need a job and we need to get them a job
529651 i dont think the findings will affect sacs decision at all
529652 rather it is what the district and the board have done and will do in light of the findings what steps we will take to ensure that history does not repeat itself
529653 the risk of losing our accreditation has brought into sharper and ever present focus the benefits the public derives from accreditation the entire community we serve is at risk and the board recognizes its past actions are to blame
529654 thats 100 percent unmitigated lies i dont recall trying to influence them hire of anybody

529659 but that was supposed to come after the last two rounds not all in one round
529660 that would have been too much if i got up and down from there
529661 i played in college and i played all right i was a decent player but just kept working at it and finally it took me like man 15 years to get my pga tour card but i finally did it and then got my lunch handed to me out there so i was already 45 years old when i did it so i said maybe well just wait for the next level and here i am
529662 her first words were she was very happy to see very nice people she was ecstatic
529663 and i think where the confusion arises is the fact that you cannot view monetary policy as a sort of simple issue if the most probable outcome is coming out of this soft patch into moderate growth with low inflation which i think is the most probable outcome that is not the same statement as saying that you therefore in the process of implementing monetary policy or formulating it i should say completely disregard what the upsides and downsides of a potential outcome may be
529664 i think the data at this stage in the united states are not suggesting recession
529665 were right on the brink and i would be more surprised if we didnt have a recession than if we did given the financial state
529666 at this stage i think they are the major reason why in the very short term were fending off inflationary pressures

529674 ive seen tiger hold up so many it would be nice to hold one up ive been a long time doing this so im certainly overdue
529675 i played well today drove it in the fairway which was critical with the wind to keep minimising your mistakes on second shots the course is toughening up and i think three or four under tomorrow would be excellent

529717 new zealand first has a confidence and supply agreement with labour this is how clarks minority government stays in power and peters gets the plum job of foreign affairs minister in return the agreement is signed and there in black and white so counting on new zealand firsts support should be a foregone conclusion it is not peters knows once he and his party vote for the money bill he loses his hold over labour he becomes expendable and clark can fire him under huge pressure over his partys murky finances peters is coming up with every excuse he can think of to further delay the bill a turkey does not vote for an early christmas
529718 clark is sweating because she needs the bill soon and failure means a snap election when her party is so far behind in the polls she would much prefer to wait another four months and hope the gap narrows by the time the campaign starts however she has little hope of improving her poll ratings as long as she is tethered to the scandal prone peters clarks advisers know she would immediately get a boost if she acted tough and sacked him but of course she cannot do so while that pesky bill is sitting there

529813 along with a few other fair board members in the early 1980s tanton founded a nationalist organization called witan short for the old english term

529870 we indigenous peoples are emphatic in stating that those primarily responsible for climate change are the governments and companies of the industrialized world
529871 they are encouraging a production and consumption model that is destroying the biodiversity and natural resources of our mother earth
529872 if something sounds too good to be true then it probably is
529873 companies would focus on utilizing idle land including former forest concession areas
529874 levels of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem destruction waste discharges into the atmosphere and current population and consumption levels all exceed what can be sustained much less expanded and still main a livable earth mainstream and even radical groups such as greenpeace and rainforest action network are pursuing goals inadequate to sustain the biosphere further illustrating the failure of the environmental movement to enunciate a sufficient global ecological response we intend to continue exposing forest liars ensuring they cause no further harm
529875 establishing global ecological reserves over half the earths surface is required to achieve global ecological sustainability and ensure our and all species habitat needs are met this will be difficult may take decades to achieve and will need to be carried out in conjunction with population limits ending fossil fuel use and political commitments to equity justice and peace but this is the only way humanity will survive an ecological revolution based upon ecological truths is needed immediately not politically expedient half measures
529876 wwf and other environmental groups hailed 85 industrial destruction and diminishment of the rest of worlds remaining large forest ecosystems as good news
529877 how does forest stewardship council fsc certified logging of primary and old growth forests protect endangered forests
529878 simply fsc certification isnt the ultimate protection for endangered forests but it is a vastly superior alternative to standard industrial logging in forests that would otherwise be logged without third party oversight fsc promotes practices that preserve ecosystem functions like habitat and water quality and safeguards the most ecologically valuable areas
529879 a more careful reading of recent advances is conservation biology and climatology would show the importance of maintaining ancient forest in an intact unfragmented condition as the keystone response to protecting biodiversity and climate all indications are the earth has surpassed the amount of intact terrestrial ecosystems that can be lost and still maintain the biosphere if this is indeed the case all efforts to reform logging to make it a bit better are meaningless ancient forest logging must end

529882 opening with the perfect foreshadowing device a summary of the legend of st valentine author jamieson wolf sets the reader up for an erotic supernatural romp thats going to have meaning the story valentine is fast paced and well told and offers not just a quick and lusty romance but a storyline that makes the reader sympathize with the characters plights and care about the point wolf wishes to make
529883 i like this writers way with words valentine is an amazing book that everyone shoul read he builds a good plot and develops his characters well i would give it 5 stars out of 5
529884 jamieson wolf writes with some of the strongest emotion i have found in ages his passion is reminiscent of that seen in the works of shakespeare and others of that time period his characters love deeply and without restraint overcoming every obstacle placed before them this is truly a tale for all those who believe love has no boundaries
529885 jamieson wolf is what i would call a fabulous storyteller he dreams up or gets visited by great characters and he paints them vividly when he writes he gets fantastic story ideas and pounds them out in a way that makes you lean in toward the computer screen or flip through the physical pages faster and faster to see whats happening to these people next
529886 this book is great this is a must read book for any body who loves ghost fantasy supernatural fun a surprise around every corner awaits the reader i am so happy to have purchased this book and add it to my own family library we just have to wait until jamieson wolf gets another fun book out there for all of us to read well worth it for your own fun reading and for your book collection a five star rating from me love it

529896 this isnt the way most faculty want to go the cookie cutter approach provided by blackboard is exactly what the majority of faculty want
529897 ive got to make my edupunk post and its going to be short i only have 2 things to say
529898 im relatively certain that theyve had to do forum posts but not keep a blog
529899 it depends on the class people who blog for classes they enjoy being in enjoy blogging people who blog for classes they dont like as much feel like blogging is a chore
529900 thats a possibility but it has to be handled just right a professor can try and come up with a way that they think is creative and interesting at the beginning of the semester but if the students still see it as a chore the professor should be willing to adapt what they consider to be their ideal plan
529901 for me absolutely i know that some people can get into a paper writing mindset and just cruise toward an a i am not some people i cannot step into that state of mind and work my online posts however are to the best of my knowledge grammatically correct and spelling error free
529902 i feel like its a lot easier to stay on track with traditional writing assignments because they have deadlines with a blog youre on your honor to post the right amount of times my ideal class modeled after dr scanlons women in modernism would have traditional assignments for most of the grade and the blog as a participation grade when you know the blog is just for expanding on class ideas and communicating with other people in the class its more fun and theres less pressure to post an epic each time
529903 i like traditional writing assignments because i like handing in hard copies but i think id like blogging just as much
529904 for me anyway its more instantaneous than writing a paper i e less formal and structured and also more interactive as you can read classmates blogs and they can read yours but you rarely read each others papers but at the same time it gives you more room and time to collect and put together your thoughts than you get during class discussions so you can explore things more deeply without necessarily having to write that formal paper on the topic so i guess it sort of walks that line between traditional writing and interactive discussion
529905 i really like umw blogs i didnt think twice about where to post my umwblogs org this way whenever i post its easy for my friends at umw to find my blog and also for other students at umw to read in case theyre thinking about studying abroad too
529906 theyre useful if actually utilized but completely ridiculous if not we had to make them for ital201 and never used them so it was just sort of annoying but for my english courses theyre pretty interesting
529907 it would depend how much they asked me to do id probably feel like it was tedious but would get into after i started as the ideas rolled out
529908 i think its good supplement if you actually tie the blogging and the class discussion together in some way but again i think it really depends on how its handled
529909 i enjoy reading original content every now and then but i was against having to use a blog nonumw though for one of my classes but i wasnt really interested in that class anyway
529910 as long as i could actually think up the required content without having to really overstretch my creative boundaries i would be fine with it
529911 i think the blog is pretty easy to use i havent had any trouble its very user friendly my problem with it was the opposite i wanted more options to do myself like pick my own layout for the site i settled with taking my own picture for the header
529912 yes i mean were students we have the most experience with modern technology but im not saying we should get rid of the user friendly format altogether that should be available for people who are not comfortable using modern blog technology
529913 one in which the going to class and actively paying attention to the lecture powerpoint activity is a key part of the class supplemented by online or in text readings and maybe a bit of blogging depending on what class its for
529914 im very new to these well ive been watching things on youtube like charlie the unicorn and yugioh abridged for ages but i never contributed a few days ago i opened my first flickr account to more easily post to my umw blog and it was easy to use as well im not on twitter yet but well see
529915 ive only briefly used flickr and twitter i know one professor who had mini lectures or would make announcements using videos and loaded them via youtube ive never heard of del icio us
529916 it probably depends on the class and what theyre focusing on but i think having a del icio us feed of relevant things tagged by classmates is really cool and interesting it could potentially spark new directions to take etc flickr and youtube more or less only work if theyre used in a way thats relevant to the course and im honestly not sure how youd use twitter as an effective learning tool quite yet but im sure theres a way
529917 i think youtube would be fun i dont understand the purpose of twitter i have it though
529918 i think itd help me learn i dont see how it would be confusing if the professor gives instructions on how to use it as long as were told how to use it i think it would be easy to do
529919 english classes history classes art and art history classes psych and sociology classes and anything dealing with contemporary issues or the sharing of great amounts of personal input without the waste of paper or email inbox space
529920 i think its helpful but not so reliable some things contradict each other on blackboard and i end up calling other people to confirm what the homework actually is
529921 im fine with it i dont love it or hate it but it works so im content
529922 i honestly have never used it for much beyond looking at my syllabi to check on assignments etc i have a tendency to misplace my printed copies ive never really had a professor or teacher use it for much beyond posting syllabi and assignments and sometimes but not often grades
529923 i like the concept but the execution is flawed i like that there is a digital dropbox to hand in papers and store documents i like that professors can post useful or required things i like that it allows for quick quizzes to be done but i dislike the inconsistency which some professors use require its use or fail to put things on there that should be on there it had potential but i think that the times killed it by making things that could be more efficiently used
529924 its all right you know just for grades and stuff but there arent a lot of other options and it doesnt have pretty colors
529925 i havent actually considered that i mean blackboard does a lot of things that are useful like having a discussion board that most of my classes dont implement maybe the answer is that i think we ought to be using blackboard to the fullest instead of halfheartedly to take advantage of what it does
529926 id like some sort of feed or notification system so that when professors post required information you know it gets posted some professors expect you to check blackboard all the time so when something gets posted and you dont notice it it can really hurt
529927 honestly something about blackboard has always seemed a bit cumbersome and unappealing so i wouldnt really want it for anything more
529928 id say that they dont need to be completely internet savvy for everything but the time has come for them to have to learn how to work the tools available to them to better connect with their students this may require a bit of outside research and use of tools not provided by the school but the results should prove effective
529929 encourage students to be involved rather than forcing things on them like commenting on each others blogs and helping each other out but saying what they do and dont like agree with the teacher and the student need to work together to get the most out of it
529930 dont worry and dont be afraid to ask your students for ideas and the internet is not that scary or complicated really
529931 i think its great i mean there are no identical institutions of learning classes and certainly no identical students we all learn differently and its great that now we have so many different and customizable ways to learn and share our learning
529932 i think its an interesting prospect that teachers should take into account to change things up in the classroom and if used properly could help get students more involved in something theyre familiar with
529933 i think its on the whole a good initiative itll be uncomfortable at first especially with the older professors the more tech comfy professors in my department have already attempted use of moodle and other similar programs if its going to work itll require less reliance on the current commercial systems and switching to the new open source systems i saw it this past semester my computer science professor tried to parallel use of our current commercial system and an open source system but the students primarily used the old system for reasons of ease of login familiarity etc on the other side the professor didnt do his best to keep up both systems and at the sign of more students using the old system let the old system reign use of youtube has been accepted by my public speaking professor and at my university job for example we use googledocs for maintenance of information on individual client systems and even to keep one another posted on what were up to in the working day so far it beats the pants off of the old paper system
529934 i pretty much agree with it i feel like if there is a better way of doing something you should forget the school system and use what works best for example the school email is less than good so gmail wins out if blackboard is failing the purposes of a class i fully support finding the best alternative plus if a class uses a system that students are already a part of and are fluent in then they will be more likely to use it and enjoy using it
529935 shiny i think its great i mean im sure its better than blackboard and stuff anythings better than blackboard
529936 i think its a really the word i want theory concept practice thing we should do im a fan of the diy idea behind it and i think it offers a lot more freedom to customize for each classs needs something that blackboard doesnt really do on its own
529937 i like it it reminds me of steampunk the term for an internet developed method of writing crafting living that evokes victorian sci fi and man do i love steampunk
529938 i think its funny and i think your porcupine is funny
529939 i like it except for how its all in caps it makes it seem like an acronym if it were edupunk or edupunk or something like that it seems like it would flow better to me is it an apt label well its a created name and a created name can be as apt as you want it to be but it sounds like what it represents
