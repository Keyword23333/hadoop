3380022 the investment bank continues to be negatively affected by the disruption in the credit and mortgage markets as well as by overall lower levels of liquidity and wider credit spreads
3380023 the continuation of these factors could potentially lead to reduced levels of client activity lower investment banking fees and lower trading revenue

3380054 but a decrease of three or four really isnt relevant a lot that has to do with factors like how accurate the shooter was and how effective the emergency room treatment was three or four murders are within the margin for error

3380067 there is no question that the current housing market has created problems for some families and tremendous opportunities for others
3380068 there are so many fantastic buying opportunites out there right now im personally trying to raise 10 million in capital to expand my own investment portfolio
3380069 absolutely but i also believe that for those that do not they may fail to include into their buying decision the vital role that population trends have on our economy and the county in which we live it is by carefully analyzing these figures that we can reasonably predict future housing demands
3380070 with an increase in future housing demands and a limited supply of land to build on existing home prices are likely to appreciate in the foreseeable future
3380071 investors recognize this and are patient enough to wait awhile to reap the rewards your average homebuyer is more emotionally connected with the day to day value versus the future value thus missing out on future equity appreciation
3380072 population has increased by 36 6 since 2000 making prince william county the states second most populous county
3380073 its the basic laws of supply and demand at work not a carnival sideshow involving smoke and mirrors
3380074 i told him not to go because its during the olympic games and this period is sensitive
3380075 in march they indicated to local residents and media their serious intent to press ahead with their mosque but refused to answer questions or give details
3380076 so five months later worried locals are left with the threat of this huge mosque hanging over their heads yet still are given no information
3380077 tablighi jamaat is a secretive global missionary sect from south asia that wants to build its international headquarters mosque here in london
3380078 yet they will not enter into discussions or explanation of their plans
3380079 el nuestro era el grupo de la muerte y ahora vamos a descansar un poco
3380080 marta es la mejor jugadora del mundo y se crece ante defensas duras
3380081 haya encontrado su juego y marcado tres goles en el partido de hoy
3380082 intentamos presionar mucho a nigeria al principio del partido pero no pudimos controlar bien y tuvimos alg n apuro despu s del primer gol volvimos al plan original pero cuando tienes un rival del mismo nivel es dif cil mantener la presi n sobre l todo el partido
3380083 el segundo gol de cristiane fue fant stico en los partidos anteriores no marc y por eso los goles de hoy fueron muy importantes para ella y para nuestro equipo hicimos un buen trabajo cooperando en pases y estoy muy contenta con el resultado
3380084 brasil campe n del mundo corea del norte y alemania sin decir que brasil es el mejor
3380085 no creo que hayamos jugado los peores partidos de la historia de de los juegos hemos trabajado mucho pero no importa lo duro que trabajes si no ganas es in til no hemos podido tener a las mejores jugadoras y la mayor a llevan mucho tiempo sin jugar con nosotros esto no es un problema que afecte s lo a nigeria
3380086 between may and october 2002 i attended one fundraiser for each of vito fossella john faso for comptroller and the conservative party because i was attempting to build multi party support for my anticipated non partisan city council special election race in february 2003
3380087 conversely i have given thousands of dollar to democrats before during and after that time
3380088 mr mcmahon has given thousands of dollars to the conservative party over the past 8 years and has run with their endorsement in the current election he sought their endorsement
3380089 steve harrison continues his relentlessly negative campaign because he has no record of his own to run on and no hope of winning this seat for the democratic party his hypocrisy is striking since harrison has routinely supported republican candidates in the past such as marty golden and john faso and of course contributed to the conservative party
3380090 its a nice game with the pressure off us and the manager says he wants a win so we are going to play our normal game and hope we get a result
3380091 the situation was slipping out of hand and the police had to open fire in which at least two people mohammad maqbool and abdul aziz were killed several others were injured
3380092 as prices continue to rise people will start to buy cheaper less nutritious food and may begin to skip meals in lesotho we are already seeing people skipping meals because they cant afford food
3380093 for people living with hiv who require more nutrition than healthy people this will have terrible consequences
3380094 the effects of climate change have made food production less secure droughts longer and when the rains come they are heavier and damage crops
3380095 in the past only the poorest 10 percent of the population has generally needed assistance but that figure is rising along with food prices
3380096 putting people on treatment without ensuring that they have enough to eat is like sending your kids to school without any books
3380097 with high food prices here to stay for the foreseeable future it is critical to supplement hiv and tb programmes with a nutritional component
3380098 in some cases such as school feeding and feeding people on arvs provision of food packages is the ideal solution
3380099 but where local markets are able to provide a nutritious diet cash transfers may be the best way forward
3380100 i dont think there are more than 250 tigers in the sundarbans now
3380101 the fate of the sundarbans is inextricably linked to the fate of its wildlife the problem is that those whose lives it saves act as its worst enemy if the tigers die the sundarbans will die if the sundarbans die bangladesh will die too
3380102 poachers timber merchants and shrimp farmers have built up an unholy nexus of corruption with the rangers forest officers and politically influential people
3380103 people should be made aware of the need for keeping the tigers and the forest alive the international community and ngos can play a leading role in this effort but we dont see them coming forward to do this
3380104 the death of a goat or a chicken is a major loss for a poor farmer or fisherman so he wouldnt pardon the tiger for doing that moreover tigers are considered predators it will take many years before people begin to think they and the wildlife are on the same boat of existence
3380105 it doesnt look like were going to see a fall which is what were in the middle of and a quick bounce back it does look as though its going to go on and well have slow growth for some time
3380106 on top of that house prices were overvalued according to most economists and so you have the situation where they remain undervalued for a long time
3380107 as a building society we always aim to offer our members the best possible deals however we have seen continued large rises in money market rates together with further competitor activity and as a result it has been necessary to increase the rates on our range of mortgages
3380108 risk now rules the strategic roost rather than demand for market share whilst it is sad that the 125 and 100 deals are no longer available in the market it is no surprise with house prices remaining stagnant at best and the poor pr that northern rock has created around these products
3380109 responsible lending is the new catch phrase especially with the trend in repossessions upwards first time buyers will be affected but you can see them calling on their parents to provide more of the deposit than before the credit crunch but is this the cause of falling house mover transactions probably not as people higher up the chain are probably suffering just as much pain securing their own funding as available ltv values are reducing quickly
3380110 so in the end is the current tightening of criteria and reduction in ltvs good news well for those consumers about to enter the housing market and over stretch themselves probably yes as it will prove harder to get on the housing market those already with high ltvs needing to refinance after coming off a fixed rate or consolidating then no as there appears to be few opportunities to find a financial solution we look forward to the time when a competitive edge returns to create a more buoyant and more balanced mortgage market

3380120 my parents want to fix up their fence i want to build on my property and other people have their own improvements
3380121 but who wants to invest your money when you think the city is just going to end up taking your home from you
3380122 corrections officers can monitor exactly the whereabouts of an offender at any given moment these are very precise satellite driven devices
3380123 it makes the job of the correctional officer more efficient
3380124 i turned around to my dad and said thats exactly what i want to do
3380125 he goes its not how many times you get knocked down but its how many times you get back up and go forward carl latz said his son told him
3380126 and i told him thats exactly what this is all about and if nothing else this letter just taught you a life lesson
3380127 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
3380128 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws
3380129 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world
3380130 its strange that a kid at this age would glean onto this particular kind of music and show the intensity and kind of the ability to function as kind of 8 year old blues guy
3380131 it would be unusual to find an 8 year old who can play joe satriani licks
3380132 ive had more people tell me they say its a kids body but it has a 70 year old dude inside
3380133 i think its so much you can do on the guitar
3380134 because i got more inspiration i got more sadness in me
3380135 our tv program production and broadcasting capabilities need to evolve as our network expands so we strive to embrace new technologies that can help advance our services
3380136 we work with companies such as proxim wireless and smartway digital to ensure that we continue to deliver state of the art multimedia solutions to our audience and provide superior real time information broadcasting
3380137 this deployment was especially challenging because we needed to integrate different kinds of wireless networks as well as av compression with wimax
3380138 proxims end to end wireless product portfolio is ideal for such a deployment since the equipment provides end to end qos which is critical for voice and video and enables us to customize a network to meet the precise wireless needs of our customers with the confidence that the equipment will interact well throughout the network
3380139 proxim has a long history as an innovator in the wireless broadband market and was an early proponent of wimax technology this deployment illustrates the benefits of proxims end to end solution by providing a more cost effective and higher capacity solution than the previous satellite based system enabling the delivery of wireless iptv to more people
3380140 taiwan is a key growth area for us offering significant market opportunities for wimax as well as other technologies in our broadband wireless product portfolio
3380141 the timing is right for this demonstration weve seen a massive increase of interest in targeted advertising and are already working with iptv broadcasters network owners and vendors not to mention advertising agencies and brands mobile tv is a vital part of the rapidly changing world of tv and is a vital part of our roadmap like packet vision udcast is a pioneer in its particular area of innovation with a proven track record and global reach so there is a natural synergy between the two companies
3380142 we expect targeted advertising to be an important element of mobile tv business models including free to air services where finding ways to generate revenue from advertising will be essential udcasts mobile tv solutions are compliant with majority of standards deployed across the world we are in an ideal position to provide the global platform for delivering mobile tv so it makes sense to work with packet vision which we believe is at the forefront of delivering targeted advertising technology on ip video networks
3380143 with the panasonic viera pz81 with freesat hd built in in the venue were going to be able to get as close to the action as possible by watching the team in full hd unfortunately not everyone who would liked to have gone to qingdao to cheer on the skandia team gbr sailing team could make it but watching the games in hd at the gb team hq is the next best thing to being there in person there are going to be some tense moments whilst we watch the team strive for glory
3380144 the olympic games in beijing are being shot on panasonics high definition professional tv cameras which capture the drama in a way previously never experienced by viewers of course you need an hdtv to fully appreciate this which is why we wanted to share this experience with the sailing community on the south coast because seeing is believing

3380168 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3380169 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3380170 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3380171 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3380172 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3380173 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3380174 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3380175 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3380176 come on 50 000 is not a lot of money which means most seniors are excluded from the tax break

3380179 the fact that i sight is already in use at a very similar organization in another state gave us the confidence that it will work for us

3380193 four ships are been prepared for a recovery process of the logs this process might take about five days
3380194 navigational warnings are being transmitted on a regular basis via voice mari band radio to warn ships that are in the vicinity to keep away

3380210 fnb wishes to stress that the home loan applications being re assessed are those that take up to a year or longer to register are of a development type nature excluding building bonds and are not those that normally take three to four months to transfer and register
3380211 the intention of this decision is to prevent customers from taking on more debt than they are unable to service resulting in an over indebtedness position
3380212 fnb through this action wishes to prevent customers from possibly damaging their credit standing and or losing their homes as a result of over indebtedness possibly leading to insolvency
3380213 each of these home loans will be re assessed on a one on one basis with the intention of granting final approval for as many of the affected customers as possible the bank will only decline applicants in cases where the client will be severely over indebted should the transaction go ahead
3380214 customers that do not provide their updated financial information are required to confirm their intention to conclude the pending deal failing which fnb home loans will contact each and every one of the identified customers with the intention to proceed with the home loan unless the above mentioned are applied
3380215 fnb is cognisant of the impact its decision may have on any one developer and their financial institutions and will accordingly engage with them to find an amicable solution to mitigate any undue losses that may arise

3380240 getting the location right is a big challenge particularly in the uk where onshore turbines tend to be located on ridges or hills
3380241 when you are working on a ridge for example the wind flow and turbulence can be very different just 100m further down the ridge and the current approaches are just too simple to detect those differences
3380242 sodars use a loud speaker to send out beeps of noise into the atmosphere
3380243 those sound waves get reflected back by wind flow and temperature variations and that gives you a good idea of where the turbulence is if you use three speakers you can get a 3d view ranging from a height of 20m to 300m from that you can work out the best location and height for the turbine and get a measure of how much strain the turbines will have to face
3380244 weve worked out a signal processing mechanism that means that instead of sending out uniform beeps we can send out sound at different frequencies and then analyse its behaviour
3380245 it allows us to get much richer data from each pulse of sound and results in five times as many data points

3380342 this is one of the first studies to report that children with certain genetic backgrounds are even more susceptible to asthma than if they lived near major roads and did not carry the variations
3380343 we are working to understand how traffic related exposures may interact with these genes leading to asthma development
3380344 this finding demonstrates the critical role of gene environment interaction in determining disease susceptibility
3380345 the investigators at usc have identified key genetic variations in biological pathways related to pah metabolism that are associated with the occurrence of asthma in children who live in close proximity to traffic
3380346 it is difficult to say that if parents with an asthmatic child move further from busy streets the child will definitely have fewer symptoms
3380347 all that can be said at this moment is that data from this and other studies show strong evidence that living near heavy traffic increases asthma risks and exacerbates symptoms in children who already have asthma

3380379 at some point cells in an embryo must separate into those that will become heart cells liver cells blood cells and so on although this has been studied for years there is still a lot we dont understand
3380380 in order for this cell migration to happen you have to have cells that go and cells that stay
3380381 there must be a clear distinction a separation between different types of cells which on the surface look the same
3380382 when apontic is mutated the distinction between migrating and nonmigrating cells is fuzzy
3380383 in these mutants we see a lot of cases where migrating cells do not properly detach from their neighbors but instead drag them along as they move away
3380384 not only is this a new solution to the problem of how to create a pattern out of no pattern but we have also discovered that apontic is a new regulator of cell migration
3380385 its more about just understanding what the positive and negative regulators of cell migration are

3380407 most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid 20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic ghg concentrations

3380435 the rivalry between the beatles and the rolling stones back in the 1960s was always a pretty good natured affair what is without doubt is that both bands had a huge impact on popular culture ronnie was and is part of that huge creative explosion its fascinating to see that creativity expressed in ronnies visual art

3380441 the knowledge and skills obtained would be invaluable in a wide range of careers and activities

3380448 technology might be useful even life saving but it would inevitably produce environmental effects impossible to predict and impossible to undo
3380449 the bombs would generate electromagnetic pulses intense enough to paralyze electrical systems across a continent
3380450 bill joy a founder of sun microsystems cited the bomb in a famous 2000 article in the magazine wired he said it was common for scientists and engineers to fail to understand the consequences of our inventions while we are in the rapture of discovery
3380451 i parent with common sense and just because a book or website or doctor or friend or grandma or stranger on the internet says this doesnt make it right
3380452 it was really kind of silly i dont know what the heck he was thinking
3380453 our main objective would be to through intelligence find out about a plot before it ever got to a stage where a nuclear device or a dirty bomb was coming our way
3380454 this provides for our defense after a plot has already been launched and a device is on its way
3380455 its a vision of how it will work if all the components come together
3380456 the importance of protecting the nations financial center will remain
3380457 and the ability to protect an urban center from a dirty bomb or a nuclear device will also remain
3380458 it is one tool of ensuring that if there is somebody on a terrorist watch list or someone driving erratically or if a pattern develops that raises suspicions it gives them an opportunity to investigate further and if need be track down the drivers or the passengers

3380468 the problem with supply chains is that many are still organised in silos and if you cut carbon in one of these areas you can end up increasing emissions in another area
3380469 we are all aware of the idea that you can cut emissions from flights by importing flowers from the netherlands instead of africa for example but now studies have shown african flowers have a lower overall carbon footprint as they do not require heated glasshouses
3380470 the cross functional approach to supply chain management that has been part of management theory since the eighties
3380471 now there is not any man that can sacrifice his own blood which will atone for the sins of another
3380472 for it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice yea not a sacrifice of man neither of beast neither of any manner of fowl for it shall not be a human sacrifice but it must be an infinite and eternal sacrifice
3380473 if theyre looking for software that will actually help them write a good poem though there thankfully is no such beast imagine the books of celebrity poetry flooding the shelves if there were
3380474 in response this here is a fun bit of web related poetry writing software
3380475 tis a google poetry machine robot thing and can produce amusing even occasionally helpful results
3380476 well theres racter the poem writing program christian bok describes in his essay the piecemeal bard is deconstructed which you can find here
3380477 dont know that its commercially available though i must say
3380478 though theyre not specifically aimed at poets per se it strikes me that the hypertext possibilities of storyspace and html accord much more closely with poetrys nonlinear allusive impulses than with narrative oetry
3380479 also fashionable noise on digital poetics by brian kim stefans discusses software he developed to generate random text with a poetry like texture an example of a long poem thus produced is included
3380480 ive used rhyming software before that poet andrew hudgins passed down to me my computer crashed though and so i no longer have that software but im sure there are plenty of good versions
3380481 ive been wanting to create a post about this and i probably still will but in the meantime heres what i use onenote
3380482 onenote has fantastic search so if i remember some odd phrase that i typed six months ago i can find it
3380483 this isnt software to help me become a better writer it wont suggest verbs or slash adjectives although it does have dictionary and thesaurus tools but its an organizational tool so that i can spend less time hunting and more time creating
3380484 they took all especially chris kaman completely out of the game they trapped him they threw a lot of guys around him that can happen
3380485 you just type in things that feel natural to you
3380486 the particular dilemma that needs to be solved here is how can one end user trust that a word wont do anything harmful to their data or privacy be it intentional or accidental while still providing a a low barrier of entry for aspiring authors to write and distribute their own verbs
3380487 the persistent spirited craving we have for connection meaning relevance peace cant really be abandoned because from 8 to 5 we have a job can it more and more and more we see people bringing their humanity to work and finding ways to specify whats really important less is more seems to me the only time more is more is when its more of less
3380488 what are the motions im supposed to be going through
3380489 each enterprise needs to design around the key activities appropriate to its mission and its strategies
3380490 what are the motions im supposed to be going through
3380491 write exactly what i say over the past few years i lived in a democratic society i was happy and now america and the european union are spitting on us
3380492 we get a lot less sales since our ranking dropped
3380493 what seo or client has not had the experience of learning a kw phrase they thought would convert well was near useless after climbing in the ranking
3380494 why wouldnt measurement of our efforts to move clients up in the ranking be relevant

3380500 we knew the trains came through here but we didnt know how bad it would be
3380501 as a city were looking at ways to save money but there are things that i think are almost a necessity especially when they impact the quality of life for so many of our residents
3380502 weve got houses and businesses that back right up to the tracks
3380503 when i have patients on the table and theyre supposed to be relaxing well they cant when the horn blows right in your ear
3380504 it was inventive on his part ill give him that
3380505 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3380506 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3380507 we left when the shelling started we dont have food
3380508 we may say that the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3380509 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3380510 everyone was saying that this team is not even going to make it to the second day we read all that yeah we did
3380511 we sat up in the computer lab and said we cant believe theyre writing this stuff we always knew at the least that we would be a team that would be in position to be looking at a medals podium
3380512 we talked every night we never stopped believing in ourselves
3380513 as far as im concerned this is gold for us
3380514 i said you guys this meet has been great regardless of what happens
3380515 i told them that i loved them no matter what happens
3380516 its every single tear shed and all the toil in my life the emotional heartbreaks it all seems worth it now
3380517 and theres my knee and im favoring my bad left ankle with my bad right leg which is where i had my knee surgery
3380518 i never would have expected it just a few weeks ago
3380519 personally i exceeded all my goals here today what a tremendous honor to be up on the podium at the olympic games
3380520 theres a pond outside our village lillies full of algae its pretty gross
3380521 we told ourselves that if we medal were going swimming in that pond
3380522 you never really know why someone wants to be around you or if they do genuinely like you i wish everyone had a label on their forehead so you could automatically tell their intentions sometimes you just wish no one wanted anything from you
3380523 we were both small town people doing very big things and we relied on each other dealing with fame
3380524 i have been using the new tt home abdominal workout program for 2 weeks and i really like it
3380525 we came back from shopping to find the back door smashed in and on the kitchen work top
3380526 the police here didnt tell us much so i went to the station to ask why
3380527 but when i told the desk sergeant i didnt know who they were looking for they just werent interested
3380528 when i came home i noticed the fridge magnets had been rearranged and said oldham task force called
3380529 these are for children theyre not for the police to leave a message theyve raided your house
3380530 it makes me feel theyre treating me like some sort of scruff basically something on the bottom of their shoe and theyre laughing at me
3380531 i dont find it a laughing matter when my two year old son is in bed with a wooden door that can easily be pulled off every night
3380532 my son cant play in the back garden and ive had to write to the chief constable to ask for a new door i want a written apology so i can show it to my neighbours
3380533 i only moved into the street 11 days ago because its a quiet area so ive had to go round to my neighbours and explain im not an idiot or a criminal
3380534 the back door boarded up makes it look like a crack house
3380535 i work for a living we try hard to keep our heads above water with the baby and everything so i dont want to be treated like a scruff who hangs about on the streets all day
3380536 acting on the basis of intelligence officers entered the house as part of a search for a wanted man who had been recalled to prison the wanted man was not there but was later found and arrested at a nearby address
3380537 as regards the alleged use of fridge magnets we are currently looking into this aspect of the incident an inspector will now visit the mans house to discuss this with him
3380538 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
3380539 they were the reason we bought this house because it had a big yard for them to run in
3380540 what we bring is operating rooms and surgical capability to where these people live since they couldnt get to managua the nicaraguan capital themselves

3380551 heat is an age old problem for computers however what once used to be a concern primarily for cutting edge systems has now become an issue for everyone
3380552 oems developing high performance low noise systems require a safe thermal management solution that not only keeps their systems cool but is easy to install maintenance free and most important is virtually noise free
3380553 the days of computers that sound like jet aircraft taking off are over our award winning lclc provides worry free aggressive thermal management for advanced gaming and graphics intensive applications especially those using multiple gpus like amds latest r700 based graphics cards

3380562 his numbers were good but you dont want to keep saying but you dont want to make that one throw in this league when everything is even there are just a few plays and a few players in a game that makes a difference we cannot give the ball up
3380563 the spring game is a perfect example he had a great scrimmage and then there late he forced the ball
3380564 hes getting there its a work in progress hes serious about doing well hell get there i know hell get there you want to learn the hard lessons in scrimmages you dont want to learn them in a big game
3380565 there are going to be bad routes or a tipped ball that comes with it theres not a quarterback in history that hasnt thrown an interception but he ran the offense extremely well there were far more positives than one or two plays
3380566 as an offense were trying to eliminate turnovers whether its interceptions or fumbles whether it be false starts and things like that
3380567 were just trying to get out there and make as few mistakes as we can because the team that makes the fewest mistakes is going to win
3380568 we tackled in the first scrimmage about as well as weve tackled in a first scrimmage
3380569 that was a big goal of ours going into the scrimmage to pick up from where we ended last season with that schedule we play we dont have time to work ourselves into that we have to start off well from the beginning

3380614 this study indicates that disturbances during pregnancy that affect intrauterine growth could compromise the function of organs in adulthood
3380615 salt sensitivity in children is low and rises with increasing age through adulthood
3380616 during adolescence about 18 percent to 20 percent of adolescents in the general population have the condition however in the study salt sensitivity was present in 37 percent of all low birth weight children and in 47 percent of the children in our study who were small for gestational age
3380617 these children should be followed for signs of reduced renal function and also for an elevated blood pressure
3380618 theres nearly a 50 percent chance of favorably affecting blood pressure by simply reducing salt intake in children born sga and nearly a 40 percent chance for those born with lbw these individuals can be determined very easily if their family physician just gets data on their births

3380623 the loss of these regions would be an end to saakashvilis reuters russian president dmitry medvedev said on tuesday he had ordered troops to stop military operations in georgia before he was due to meet
3380624 we see russias decision to stop military operations in georgia as a positive development i hope we see a ceasefire confirmed by the two sides as soon as possible implementation of this decision is very important
3380625 turkey will continue its efforts for the reinstitution of peace and stability in the region we attach importance to georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty
3380626 a caucasian stability pact idea is important in the medium term we have similar efforts in
3380627 russias next steps will be to push for the recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia
3380628 the loss of these regions would be an end to saakashvilis political career so impending negotiations over the breakaway regions will be extremely difficult
3380629 georgia is clearly the major loser here however american power and its perception throughout the world has also suffered
3380630 russia wins well beyond what is going on in georgia president putin struggled for eight years to make russia into an international player but most moscow was powerless to move against u s and european policies in the past missile defence nato expansion iraq war and putin perceives the recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia as a tit for tat response to the western recognition of kosovo
3380631 putin saw this as an erosion to russian power this conflict allowed russia to demonstrate its military might but even more so its willingness to utilize it
3380632 its clear that at least for the foreseeable future the outcome of this conflict has been russias annexation of south ossetia and abkhazia
3380633 georgia has also seen a tremendous blow to its economy and potential to attract investment and a humanitarian tragedy but its too early to say that georgia has only lost
3380634 there is a little soul searching to do on the part of european countries in particular whats been shown is the wests utter inability or unwillingness to protect allies
3380635 for the united states for its credibility as a partner across eurasia has been severely damaged there is no country in which the united states has invested so much political capital as in georgia in this part of the world
3380636 obviously any ceasefire would be a start towards reconciliation but it would depend what conditions were attached and of course what happens next
3380637 but it wouldnt make an immediate difference to their rating it doesnt look very good for georgia going to war with russia is bad for your creditworthiness to put it mildly
3380638 we expect very positive market reaction to the effective end of military action and potential movement towards diplomatic resolution of the conflict as the likelihood of further escalation of armed conflict has eased
3380639 however we need to emphasize the crisis is not over yet we continue to believe the conflict is very unlikely to end in a new freeze into the quiet military standoff that has persisted since 1992 as such solution is unacceptable to both sides
3380640 it is a little bit of good news because the situation there can be relaxed a bit and some stopped supplies from kazakhstan and turkey can be shipped again soon oil from ceyhan is distillate rich so it is a good news but it is not such a big thing that the market is going to react significantly the oil market has not even reacted to the supply disruptions from ceyhan so we may not see a big change
3380641 i think probably the element of international concern has played a part what we dont know as yet are the dynamics of russian internal politics im sure there was a fairly intense debate going on behind the scenes in the kremlin
3380642 i would not expect a very strong or unified eu response in relation to this what we will find with increasing intensity is a sort of what to do with russia conversation but thats been doing on since 2004
3380643 its highly unlikely now that south ossetia will come back to georgia i think what these conflicts have pretty much sealed their fate of south ossetia and abkhazia
3380644 theyve acted as insulators against the resumption of georgian control unless there is a very intensive diplomatic track which works very consistently and rapidly towards a solution here but i think thats unlikely
3380645 ceasing fire today doesnt make a difference russia has already achieved most 80 percent of what it wanted to achieve it only did not achieve a regime change russia has shown precisely that it is in control of the southern caucasus it has consolidated its position
3380646 nato countries did not have a uniform stance on georgias and ukraines nato membership and russia took advantage
3380647 this is a very serious issue for ukraine we are thinking very seriously what it means for ukrainian politics
3380648 as long as ukraine is not a nato member russia can do as she pleases this situation could repeat itself in the pro russia crimean region maybe not today or tomorrow but in a year or two or three
3380649 its very positive news for the rouble because the georgian crisis was the only argument for the rouble weakness we saw in the last couple of days with the crisis seemingly gone the rouble should recover from the losses it suffered
3380650 certainly there will be a slightly higher risk premium to russia because the market normally remember such higher volatility periods for quite a while
3380651 if this news that military operations are stopping is correct then that it what this country needs and we can then get on to build peace
3380652 this is a beautiful place with a wonderful people they dont deserve the suffering that has been inflicted by military operations
3380653 we have to wait and see if this is implemented
3380654 russia militarily and politically achieved what it wanted in all that time apart from some verbal criticism it has not met any sharp or fundamental reaction from the united states nor europe
3380655 the eu council of ministers is only meeting tomorrow and it was russias interest to put them in front of a final state of affairs which they seem to have achieved
3380656 it would be tactically disadvantageous for russia to continue in its actions during that meeting given that they had achieved what they wanted
3380657 the attacks on the territory of georgia and the military action outside the areas of conflict discredited russia and i cannot see how russia wants to defend the role of an arbiter a neutral player in those conflicts
3380658 eu ministers should agree on changing the negotiating formats for the conflicts in ossetia and abkhazia the role of russia can no longer be that of an arbiter of these conflicts
3380659 well see a bounce in stocks we saw the currency bounce back this morning
3380660 nonetheless investors will remain cautious for some time this is just yet another in a long line of events that have raised political risk levels in russia
3380661 last month we had putin making some fairly ominous warning sounds on oao metal a mining conglomerate and hinting at the fact that they may have some tax irregularities ominous overtones that are reminiscent of what happened with yukos

3380677 however stroke may differ from other diseases and may not share the same risk factors therefore we explored whether this same lifestyle would serve as an effective approach for also lowering risk of stroke
3380678 more than half of ischemic strokes 52 percent in men and 54 percent in women may have been prevented through adherence to a healthy lifestyle
3380679 for total stroke 47 percent of cases in the women and 35 percent of cases in the men may have been prevented
3380680 this study shows that following a healthy lifestyle which has been associated with up to 80 percent lower risk of coronary heart disease and 90 percent lower risk of diabetes may also prevent more than half of ischemic strokes

3380734 that intellectuals are at once beneficiaries of a bad society and yet those on whose socially useless work it largely depends whether a society emancipated from utility is achieved this is not a contradiction acceptable once and for all and therefore irrelevant it gnaws incessantly at the objective quality of their work whatever the intellectual does is wrong he experiences drastically and vitally the ignominious choice that late capitalism secretly presents to all its dependents to become one more grown up or to remain a child

3380757 mendis was the main difference in the series it was not easy to pick runs when mendis and murali are bowling together the pressure they created made it tough for us
3380758 its important to have someone like mendis he creates opportunities adds pressure and picks up wickets
3380759 he has surprised a lot of us its an advantage to have a guy like him to back murali and chaminda vaas thats where we had lacked somebody that strike option apart from those two guys
3380760 for a new batsman to go in straight away and face two spinners is never easy we are not offering excuses as overall we did not play quality cricket
3380761 it is not about a couple of batsmen alone it is important for everyone to contribute the middle and lower order did not contribute and that let us down in the series
3380762 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3380763 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3380764 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3380765 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3380766 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3380767 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3380768 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3380769 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3380770 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3380771 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3380772 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3380773 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests

3380776 clark gregg who directed the movie version of choke which comes out in november he knew that id written choke while listening to pablo honey with creep over and over and over
3380777 so clark got radiohead to contribute a song to write a song for the very end of the movie the final credits
3380778 apparently radiohead liked the movie so much theyve written the score most of the ambient music throughout it
3380779 studies have shown that when used in combination with optimal medical therapy crt is associated with a 50 percent reduction in hospitalization for heart failure and a 36 percent reduction in mortality or death
3380780 we did this study to analyze if and how this new therapy is being used in u s hospitals
3380781 thats a small percentage when you consider that we estimate 30 percent to 50 percent of hospitalized patients with heart failure were eligible for crt based on previous studies
3380782 that means that there are a lot of patients who potentially could benefit from the device who arent receiving it
3380783 we also found that 10 percent of patients discharged with a new crt implant had an lvef of greater than 35 percent which suggests that those patients are over treated they have not been shown in trials to benefit from the therapy
3380784 i just love john and i know hes had a wonderful preaching ministry for more than 30 years but bless his heart

3380788 i am not saying that the judaizers are heretical i do believe however that they raise very basic issues with regard to the true nature of christianity and the gospel
3380789 you post a lie it is proven 100 false you move the goalposts and post yet another lie and it continues on around till were back to the original lie as if it will somehow become true if its re iterated again the same misquotes over and over again the same hindsight bias appeals to authority etc

3380795 was talking of building maybe a small pond to take some of the stormwater

3380802 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country

3380812 usually an eis focuses on the direct health impact so it doesnt tend to look so comprehensively at health
3380813 a development like this is likely to put further downward pressure on housing in the area this could potentially have significant impact on peoples economic circumstances and consequently health and wellbeing
3380814 government consultant golders was doing work on the health impact assessment and they will continue doing that so nothings changed on the impact assessment front

3380821 wall street pundits will again try to spin the gdp numbers into a positive but i believe that this is the beginning of an inevitable recession
3380822 chinas economy is on the verge of an important transition in which its consumers will begin to take their place on the world state
3380823 in china a major u s company decides to open a manufacturing plant on the outskirts of a city in order for their plant to run at maximum capacity they will need to find 2 000 workers soon the word is out that the company is paying 20 percent more than what the local farm worker earns the jobs are immediately filled and 2 000 people are now making more money since most of these workers have no debt they now have additional income to spend with the additional discretionary income comes a change in lifestyle some of the workers might eat out more often others might purchase more expensive food products such as meat still others might actually go out and purchase the washer and dryer that they have always wanted regardless of their expenditure the end result is the same average chinese consumers are way on the way to westernizing their lifestyles

3380830 theyre concerned about the event but the relative danger to the crew weve had no discussion on that at all
3380831 theyve not conveyed to us or conveyed to me any concerns at this point
3380832 gravity is not really my friend right now and 8 gs was especially not my friend
3380833 there was no action of the crew that led to this malenchenko in a post landing press conference on monday the
3380834 it may be a month of so before we start hearing anything definitive back from the commission
3380835 i dont see this as a major major problem but it is clearly something that should not have occurred
3380836 weve been discussing with the russians their ability to support soyuz production for next year
3380837 but again we need to watch and understand what the failure mode was
3380838 we determined along with the russians that that was probably more risky to go out and pull those blankets back
3380839 we didnt see any more fixes that didnt carry more risk associated with them than leaving it as it was
3380840 we really need to get the capsule back to understand what occurred
3380841 our study suggests that even modest reductions in overall smoking rates may save lives in fact quitting smoking is the most important step smokers can take to improve their overall health and that of their loved ones people who do smoke should smoke outside the house to help protect themselves and their families from home fires and exposure to secondhand smoke a known human carcinogen
3380842 home fire deaths have declined during the past several decades and this decline has paralleled reductions in smoking
3380843 we work hard to keep our homes safe and it just makes good sense to help people understand that if they can change their smoking habits we may continue to reduce these tragedies
3380844 people were running in the parking lot like they heard the plane and they were running before it hit i dont believe anybody on the ground was hurt
3380845 all we heard was a loud boom and we werent sure if it was the dumpster out back being emptied or a heavy truck traveling past our building or whatnot

3380854 fluent nhibernate at least in its current stage requires a mapping class per entity at this point i might as well use the xml again
3380855 and it just shows how unethical and immoral the opposition is to proposition 8 this is a desperate tactic that is attempting to confuse the voters
3380856 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
3380857 its one thing for the opposition to make their case with commercials persuading people to be against it prop 8 because they favor homosexual marriage and those kinds of things
3380858 but its another thing to be outright deceptive and this is the epitome of political deceptive practices that have no business in any campaign
3380859 calls are not being returned by city hall and we are not in the loop
3380860 there are taxi touts on the streets of the capital every night they circle the hot spots of london to hunt their prey innocent londoners enjoying a good night out who may not be aware that these vehicles are not properly insured and pose a real danger to anyone tempted to use them
3380861 i am determined to ensure that every man and woman in this city can feel safe when they travel around london from the moment they leave their home to the moment they return they should be able to travel in confidence removing touts from our streets will be another step in the right direction
3380862 most touts are unlicensed drivers among licensed drivers the public carriage office pco accepts that touting is largely a problem within the private hire trade however there have been occurrences of touting by licensed taxi drivers for example at liverpool street station and at heathrow airport in the interests of fairness to all drivers and to prevent legal challenge to tfl we must take a consistent approach to touting by both private hire and taxi drivers
3380863 if within one month we do not have a meeting with representatives of the mayor we will mobilise seven to eight thousand black cabs around city hall and tower bridge and block london off
3380864 it is about time the pco setup two separate entities for the private hire and black cab drivers
3380865 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
3380866 she senate majority leader harry reid and also the democrat sic presidential presumptive nominee barack obama are all committed to no new energy whether it comes from natural gas oil or coal or nuclear power
3380867 republicans are clearly frustrated that the american public is not buying their johnny one note energy policies of the past

3380869 from 2007 to the first half of 2008 vulnerabilities affecting web server applications accounted for 51 percent of all vulnerability disclosures
3380870 without a unified process for disclosing vulnerabilities the research industry runs the risk of actually fueling online criminal activity
3380871 there is a reason why x force does not publish exploit code for the vulnerabilities we have found and perhaps it is time for others in our field to reconsider this practice
3380872 when i grew up it was one country so its very painful to see whats going on the conflict sounds very scary
3380873 when superpowers are involved it can lead to sub issues as america has become upset with israel for siding with georgia
3380874 i actually went to georgia to be the head counselor at a jewish camp so i have friends in georgia
3380875 with time it will set off internal strife within georgia as they discover they are worse off than they were before
3380876 even when the hostilities cease that wont restore the buildings and lives that have been lost
3380877 sometimes war can evolve over such a small issue and here it looks like nobody can come and be involved because a superpower is involved and thousands are killed every day
3380878 in georgian grocery stores more than half of what they receive is from russia it just used to be such a close relationship
3380879 even today everyone in georgia still speaks russian as a second language and its taught in schools because of its economic and political importance in georgias history
3380880 its pure politics the people who die every day in georgia they have nothing to do with politics they are women and children it doesnt matter whos right people are not supposed to die i feel terrible about it these civilians are personal friends
3380881 secular surveys indicate that 76 percent of these students say they are on a spiritual quest for meaning purpose and god
3380882 thats a level of spiritual interest that has not been seen perhaps since the 1950s
3380883 those same surveys indicate that college students are more disconnected from the church and organized religion than ever before
3380884 they look like kiss but sound like a wicked witch gargling semen
3380885 big fuck off shiny ones ones that look like they could skin a crocodile
3380886 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3380887 you cant account for everyones stupid actions but when things do happen if you respond to it and take the appropriate action thats reassuring
3380888 thats just its wrong its a place where families come to eat and them taking a bath in the sink thats just not work ethic
3380889 burger king corp was just notified of this incident and is cooperating fully with the health department we have sanitized the sink and have disposed of all other kitchen tools and utensils that were used during the incident we have also taken appropriate corrective action on the employees that were involved in this video additionally the remaining staff at this restaurant is being retrained in health and sanitation procedures
3380890 thats just disgusting i wouldnt want to eat here after i heard something like that thats just not appropriate for employment
3380891 this kind of stunt really is a black eye for the restaurant itself
3380892 in a pandemic making enough vaccine to protect everyone will take months
3380893 so we focused our research on protecting this vulnerable group because vaccination levels in these facilities among both residents and staff will be low and unlike acute care hospitals where people constantly come and go nursing homes have a real chance at controlling access and can thereby potentially prevent a virus introduction
3380894 on the face of it it seems implausible that nonpharmaceutical measures alone would help contain a pandemic influenza
3380895 overall we found that conventional npis are sufficient to curtail mild outbreaks and that higher levels of npis requiring greater social restrictions and higher levels of cooperation were needed to manage more severe outbreaks
3380896 identifying the critical role that staff plays in controlling the spread and preventing the introduction of disease in these facilities
3380897 staff members are highly overworked and underpaid and very frequently work multiple jobs to make ends meet
3380898 they are continuously challenged with the decision of going to work even when sick or losing wages by staying at home
3380899 our work shows that isolation periods are essential to control the introduction of the virus and thereby prevent a pandemic
3380900 in our view the only feasible way to implement isolation periods is if staff receive paid sick days
3380901 our work details a set of simple interventions that seem workable and that may be easily implemented by current staff members
3380902 el gobierno no es la soluci n a nuestros problemas el gobierno es el problema
3380903 if all incompatible donors and recipients were simply listed in one common pool the problems related to incompatible and poorly matched donors and recipients would be a thing of the past
3380904 this is a rare instance of a living donor kidney being shipped across the country to initiate a chain
3380905 if we can become comfortable shipping living donor kidneys like we do with deceased donor kidneys then thousands of patients will have the opportunity to receive a kidney who otherwise would have been forced to remain on dialysis
3380906 the hope is that this marks the first of many such collaborations among the nations transplant centers donor chains have enormous potential to expand the donor pool and to provide better matched organs for the many individuals who are in desperate need of lifesaving transplants
3380907 most paired exchanges are swaps and they end whereas the chain involves an extra donor in the beginning so you can initiate a self propagating cascade
3380908 but in this case ucla received a live donor kidney from new york which hasnt been done before
3380909 living donor exchange represents the pinnacle of teamwork and professional and personal trust and good faith that ideally epitomizes the organ transplant endeavor
3380910 the team consists of surgeons physicians nurses coordinators patients and donors all working together toward the same goal
3380911 patients can wait up to eight years for a deceased donor transplant
3380912 this donor chain may enable hundreds of patients to receive a kidney thanks to one generous altruistic donor rather than in the past where only one patient benefited from an altruistic donor this could significantly decrease the waiting list for kidney transplantation
3380913 i have had the incredibly sad experience of having a colleague die while waiting for a kidney transplant
3380914 i have a close friend who donated a kidney to her brother and i have a close friend who received a kidney more than a decade ago and i see the terrific experiences shes had since
3380915 when i started thinking about it i thought im able and healthy at this point in my life to do this to help someone have more years of a better life why not donate the beauty of this partnership between excellent doctors transplant coordinators and staff at newyork presbyterian weill cornell ucla and a group of seven people a partnership connecting both coasts is that a chain of people have better lives and the chain goes on
3380916 if we can get this exchange program going its going to be the answer to lots of peoples situations
3380917 this is going to help so many people down the line
3380918 pam couldnt sit on the transplant wait list for several years something needed to be done im glad i could do my part to help
3380919 everyone would benefit if more donated today its me tomorrow its someone else
3380920 it was like a closed door that is now being opened again
3380921 randy and i talked about it and we said ok hes willing to give to somebody else and i wont have to take as many medications after the surgery
3380922 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3380923 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3380924 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3380925 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3380926 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
3380927 certainly by the end of the year people need clarity if nothing else in terms of the future
3380928 people will need to know there are obvious timetables under what conditions certain things are going to happen
3380929 it was a tight enough election but it was a definitive decision against lisbon as it stands its far too soon to be speculating on whether you have another one or if you have another one
3380930 its not being arrogant or dismissive in the past when treaties were not passed then short of renegotiation there were other avenues that were opened up and utilised not least ourselves in terms of nice i and nice ii
3380931 the idea that we are going to negotiate with this group or that group or that sector and say please vote yes and we will give you x y or z i dont think that is a modus operandi that we can go down
3380932 if there is a rerun of the lisbon referendum it should be done on its own
3380933 if ratification takes place in the other 26 states in the autumn we will be able to ask ireland to find a solution which will not block the integration process and go to the european elections with the new rules foreseen in the lisbon treaty
3380934 the challenge of solving europes political problems will begin on the day when the treaty enters into force and when the eu countries find out they can no longer rely on the right to veto by one of them
3380935 a unanimous decision from the european council representing 27 member states promising not to interfere with the neutrality abortion laws and taxation of ireland
3380936 it was an independent poll carried out by one of irelands leading independent pollsters which is red c which is based in dublin
3380937 the irish government should do as the french president has reportedly said and organise a second referendum on the lisbon treaty
3380938 why shouldnt be able to carry out a poll we were surprised from the beginning that a similar poll hadnt been taken immediately asking irish voters how they would feel about a second referendum
3380939 my sense of reality tells me that the lisbon treaty will still not be in force in the middle of 2009 i fear that the irish people would view another referendum in the spring as a surprise manoeuvre
3380940 a very clear decision of the european council that nothing will be touched in relation to neutrality and the abortion and tax regimes of ireland
3380941 youd have to arrive at that decision by a logical means by the end of this year its shaping that way its being kicked around
3380942 where its going to come to a crisis will be when the commission has to be appointed by the end of this year 25 if not 26 countries will have ratified lisbon ireland will become as the days pass increasingly exposed and dependent on goodwill that could melt away
3380943 the process of surveying the public on the reasons behind the no vote is only under way this is only one part of a few elements the government will use to inform their decision
3380944 it is a very foolish route we are taking if we think we can have another referendum
3380945 european armaments policy to provide structure for european defence and security equipment markets and to allow a sustainable and competitive technological and industrial base
3380946 the headline goal and european security strategy envisage a broad and significantly challenging set of potential missions these include separation of warring factions by force on the sort of scale that would have been required had a ground invasion of kosovo in 1999 turned out to be necessary they may also encompass stabilising operations in a failed state so the demands of todays european security and defence policy are already potentially deep and comprehensive
3380947 providing the eu with ready to go military capability to respond to crises around the world
3380948 shall not engage in or promote any activity of a primarily military relevance without the prior approval of the government
3380949 we will work closely with enterprise ireland to exploit potential research and commercial opportunities arising
3380950 a strategy for a stronger and more competitive european defence industry
3380951 but the risk of unhelpful developments during the french presidency particularly related to eu defence were just too great
3380952 we want to advance the european defence whatever the future of the treaty of lisbon is
3380953 be the first step for the rejuvenation of the european defence in the years to come
3380954 bring forward the necessary preparations in order to implement the treaty timely and smoothly and to assure that the treaty can be fully used from the time it is entering into force
3380955 france had long championed the eu over nato but president nicolas sarkozy changed that
3380956 strengthening eu nato cooperation including increasing transparency will be a priority both at the strategic and tactical levels
3380957 france should use its eu presidency for a masterstroke connecting nato and the eu by creating an operational civil military eu planning and conduct capability closely linked to natos capacities at shape
3380958 externally the eu is prospering from its openness to the rest of the world in economic terms but also in terms of cultural and knowledge exchange and in terms of the recognition given to european values worldwide
3380959 work on the implementation of the commission communication on global europe and to renew the eus commitment to global europe by asking the commission for an up date as a formal and integral part of the lisbon strategy
3380960 in effect the weight given to the external dimension is not insignificant it signals the fact that european unification is entering a new phase in its history centred no longer on europe itself but on its relationship with the rest of the world
3380961 our military tools have to adapt to globalisation and the new threats
3380962 he named among others a common air and sea combat troop and a commonly used transport fleet consisting of airbus a400m
3380963 europe works fairly well in many areas with the current treaties
3380964 we had originally made reservations for an eu debate in the autumn and perhaps a referendum due to the irish referendum the situation is now so unclear that the plan is no longer current
3380965 countries which share a common cultural heritage such as germany and austria great britain and ireland or the benelux countries could share a common commissioner
3380966 the idea of combi commissioners or half half commissioners is not even a bad summer joke
3380967 can you imagine an english commissioner for the british isles with all the history that exists between ireland and the uk said one commission official
3380968 or a german representing austria it is a total non starter
3380969 commission shall be less than the number of member states
3380970 commission shall be less than the number of member states

3380972 what it claimed to be an organisation that sprang up to deal with one issue on an ad hoc basis
3380973 ireland was used during the course of the recent election campaign not just by libertas but by a whole range of groups to promote their self interest ireland was used as a springboard for a lot of peoples ambitions including those of libertas and mr ganley
3380974 his ambitions to become involved in some sort of pan european right wing movement has been evident for some time there has long been more to libertas than meets the eye
3380975 it has very close links with people who wouldnt share the irish view of europe including ukip the uk independence party
3380976 junior minister roche is right to say that the lisbon treaty debate is over if only he and his government truly believed that rather than plotting behind the scenes to run the lisbon treaty referendum again
3380977 im hoping for a historical settlement between aland and finland on how we are to handle eu relations and to guarantee aland positions are considered

3380980 clinically important refractive error affects half of the u s population 20 years or older
3380981 our estimated prevalence of myopia was higher than the 25 percent reported in previous u s studies and similar in persons under 40 years to that of ethnic chinese persons in singapore
3380982 the direct annual cost of refractive correction for distance visual impairment is estimated to be between 3 8 and 7 2 billion for persons 12 years and older
3380983 although turkey doesnt like the present regime it has always tried to keep iranians both at bay and collaborate with them it is an extremely delicate balancing act and it will continue to be so
3380984 the visit is all about controlled risks and the most important aspect is a gas deal with iran not the nuclear program because turkey has little influence on that

3381000 inside there was a mother father and their two children they were all dead a tank just shot them
3381001 if america told them to stop fighting tomorrow they would
3381002 look we have beautiful children just like yours all we want is peace in south ossetia
3381003 the most influential response to this situation is the one articulated by zbigniew brzezinski the dean of the democratic party foreign policy establishment going back to the jimmy carter regime and even earlier brzezinskis name is associated with a new strategy which calls for a de emphasis of the middle east in favor of a global approach to crushing the power of russia and china once and for all

3381008 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3381009 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person
3381010 how do you get original material you begin to molest your neighbors kids maybe your own kids and your relatives

3381014 in other words that piece of legislation would overturn any laws that any state legislature has passed for example prohibiting taxpayer funding of abortion allowing parents a right to know when their teenage daughters are considering having an abortion a right to know or informed consent or any other common sense limits like partial abortion bans that weve put on the books that would overturn all of those laws
3381015 the boy scouts equal access act says if the school has opened its facilities for use by other organizations then it must give equal treatment to the boy scouts
3381016 that act does not say that schools must only give access to the boy scouts and not to other organizations that are religious yet thats how some of these school districts are applying this law
3381017 liberty counsel is about ready to file two other lawsuits that are very similar to this on behalf of child evangelism fellowship where in other states those schools are also using this boy scouts equal access act to justify their action

3381343 governor pawlenty so far senator mccain has said that he thinks the objective of the russians is regime change in georgia do you think that hes been on target so far
3381344 well one of the advantages of having experience in military and national security matters is you get the wisdom that comes with it as he correctly called the need for a change in strategy in iraq with the surge i think hes is correctly calling this situation he said when he looked in the eyes of vladimir putin he saw a k a g and a b i think he senses correctly that russia still has an aggressive posture in terms of its foreign policy and this could be very well an example of that so senator mccains response an aggressive response as it relates to the u n as it relates to nato as it relates to sending the secretary of state to europe i think are the right steps and it reflects his wisdom and experience in dealing not just with this region but dealing with the people involved and its a big benefit to him
3381345 as governor of a major state like minnesota and as somebody who is on the short list to be vice president why should the american people care about whats happening in georgia
3381346 georgia of course is an american ally a country that leans west the president of georgia is somebody who is educated in the united states and the alliance between that country and our country has been positive the friendship between that country and our country has been positive on a whole range of issues including economic issues including energy issues including various diplomatic and positive cultural exchanges its a nation that has been positive towards the united states it really has been a friend of our country and we want to promote those relationships around the world

3381393 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
3381394 all this unfolds so surely and hypnotically that the reader forgets that the story is based on an old shakespearian template reading it is like entering a long dream that wont let you out until its ready
3381395 the great novels do this they strip away the world and the reader re enters the everyday as if surfacing from a depth this long novel begins slowly back in 1919 but bear with it because wroblewski develops a hypnotic narrative mounting in tension as edgars life ruptures and he flees with three dogs into the wilderness
3381396 t his is a great big mesmerizing read audaciously envisioned as classic americana the story of edgar sawtelle is by no means hamlet with hounds this books brief encounters with prophecy and the supernatural have as much to do with mr kings wisconsin as they do with shakespeares denmark
3381397 o ver clever parallels look ma hamlet with dogs too often undermine wroblewskis genuine and considerable gifts yet its a measure of those gifts that i still found myself thinking who cares if im a cat lover i want a sawtelle dog
3381398 engs writing is luminous and dreamy this is a grandly old fashioned book in its scope and lushness in its lack of irony in its preoccupation with loyalty and duty and the moral quicksand to which they sometimes lead
3381399 beautifully written and deeply moving tan twan engs debut novel is one of the best books ive ever read anyone who thinks the novel is in decline should read this one
3381400 this deft first novel by malaysian writer tan twan eng stands as a lavish demonstration of the truth of william faulkners dictum the past is never dead its not even past how the war he fights within himself plays out against the backdrop of the war spreading across south asia makes the book an engrossing story of interlocking worlds
3381401 eng is unraveling a true saga here writing in great detail about the historical milieu that his fictional characters inhabit eng is a vivid writer in love with the descriptive power of strong similes even ones that seem a bit overstated
3381402 tan twan eng has written a most ambitious first novel a wide ranging epic about war and inner peace love and betrayal and the clash between east and west all seasoned with dramatic action and not a few martial arts donnybrooks that would make jackie chan envious if engs first opus has a flaw it is that the characters and dialogue can be lyric dramatic or purposeful to the point of being stilted

3381429 their problems are reduced to one simple explanation which is repeatedly emphasized
3381430 they receive unconditional love acceptance and attention from a charismatic
3381431 they are subject to entrapment isolation from friends relatives and the mainstream culture and their access to information is severely controlled

3381433 we know how obama operates weve seen it in chicago for years and were not taking any chances
3381434 if a candidates got delegates then both names can be placed in nomination
3381435 clay dougherty another san francisco delegate for clinton said that
3381436 for the first time in a generation its been a close election and this was such a unique situation
3381437 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3381438 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3381439 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3381440 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3381441 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3381442 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3381443 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3381444 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3381445 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3381446 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3381447 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3381448 the countrys still pretty divided people may want a divided government they want change but im not sure that the democratic agenda has the support of a majority of americans
3381449 until we know what senator clinton and senator obama have worked out
3381450 a regulator can never and should never attempt to control the animal spirits of the market
3381451 financial markets are not the place to practice field surgery and experimental medicine because they are too important to the vitality of the world economy

3381453 we are in the midst of a severe economic crisis
3381454 increasingly loud calls for action for someone to fix everything that has gone wrong
3381455 quick fixes and knee jerk responses generally do more harm than good by creating new problems with every attempted solution
3381456 let me assure you that this sec action had absolutely no effect on anyones ability to short any of these 19 institutions
3381457 instead it has created hidden problems in the back offices of investment and commercial banks across the street wall street that are likely to manifest themselves in coming months
3381458 i really really really wanted to win and i really really believed in it and in myself and trying to do the most that i could with it so i was quite upset about it

3381470 there is a destiny that makes us brothers none goes his way alone all that we send into the lives of others comes back into our own
3381471 lifes challenges are not supposed to paralyze you theyre supposed to help you discover who you are
3381472 omg dude i was thinking about calling you you know to see if you wanted to come to my house and eat korean bbq like with the fams but then i forgot

3381475 it could be a recycled pager it could be a number of things were just going to look at why someone else would have that number and why they would be paged by us

3381478 some people dont want to do a list because they dont want to make a menu
3381479 the time you take to plan your meals before heading to the store will pay for itself in results at the end of the week first make a list of healthy meals that fit your diet and are highly appealing
3381480 the participants who did the online ordering said it helped them stop impulse purchases and make healthier choices
3381481 you actually order less because you go look in the cupboard and make sure you dont have three boxes of rice already
3381482 its going to help you fill up more without the high calories on the main entree fruits and veggies fill your stomach without loading up calories
3381483 skip the bagel in the morning and fuel up with protein its going to stick with you longer
3381484 i really believe in eating the whole egg because there are some valuable nutrients in the yolk that you dont get other places so easily
3381485 consider that the healthiest foods in the supermarket the fresh produce are the ones that dont make fda approved health claims which typically festoon the packages of the most highly processed foods
3381486 the food label can be a consumers best shopping tool
3381487 you can compare nutrients and ingredients between similar products determine which nutrients the food contributes to your total diet safe preparation methods and much more
3381488 avoid portion distortion a muffin that you make at home would have 210 calories but the size you get in a bakery is 500 plus calories
3381489 the georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped trained that they have gained military experience in iraq it feeds this revanchist mood how can south ossetia be demilitarized when all of georgia is bristling with weaponry and its only an hours ride by tank from tbilisi to tskhinvali
3381490 obviously star wars was a huge opportunity for me and opened a lot of doors but just on a basic cool level i got to play darth vader its not often where you get to work on a film and run around every day with a lightsaber i really have no qualms about that character following me for the rest of my life
3381491 the very first day hayden walked out on the set with the darth vader suit was about two or three weeks before we finished shooting about 1 000 people from all over sydney came to watch it because it was like a seminal iconic moment in their life we tried to let as many people on the stage as we could
3381492 the films bind generations together it grows on the younger people because the mom and dad talk about them they develop a common bond in families
3381493 its tough on me because i have to see the movies quite a number of times to watch all the rest of me in the background
3381494 in the early days they put out an action figure that made me look like the blond guy from scooby doo but now theyre becoming a little more sophisticated theyre putting the cleft in my chin and making my hair brown instead of yellow
3381495 my daughter likes them because she can stick pins in them when shes mad at me
3381496 the first time i went to a convention i went how pathetic seeing all these people dressing up in silly costumes
3381497 well wait a minute this is exactly what i do for a job i better shut up
3381498 in 1982 i met a young kid with his dad and recently that young kid came to a convention here he had grown up and had become an animator because of the star wars movies its extraordinary how many people have caught on to george lucas dream and many of those youngsters are now working in animation studios or are directors or film cameramen its done an awful lot of good
3381499 they invited me into their family and now i can go around the world and hold my head and chin up and say im part of the lucasfilm family new zealand is such a small place i never imagined being in a movie let alone star wars when i had my first day of filming i knew as soon as the first shoot that this was my new family every time i see them they treat me like family
3381500 its been great being a part of that whole experience all of us who had the experience working with george lucas have been very fortunate were talking about a real legacy
3381501 it was the shampoo where you could twist off my head and pour liquid out of my neck lather up with leia and youll feel like a princess yourself i dont think they make it anymore but that was my favorite

3381511 we need to hide the fraud in the source code not reveal the fraud because its needed to control the vote in south florida
3381512 i left because all of the meetings with feeney let me know i wasnt in a situation i wanted to be in
3381513 hes in there selling contracts telling us how to bid them special little formulas being employed how you get right point structure they were going to limit how many vendors could apply to government contracts so only connected vendors could get on the approved list
3381514 in a few years they can tote this as evidence there was no fraud
3381515 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
3381516 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
3381517 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
3381518 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
3381519 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
3381520 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
3381521 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
3381522 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
3381523 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
3381524 my source also notes that dick cheney who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
3381525 instead he went to doug feiths office of special plans and asked them to do the job it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the central intelligence agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity
3381526 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
3381527 mars is not a dead planet it undergoes climate changes that are even more pronounced than on earth
3381528 weve gone from seeing as a dead planet for three plus billion years to one that has been alive in recent times
3381529 the finding has changed our perspective from a planet that has been dry and dead to one that is icy and active
3381530 of all the solar system planets has the climate most like that of earth both are sensitive to small changes in orbital parameters
3381531 now were seeing that mars like earth is in a period between ice ages
3381532 these extreme changes on mars provide perspective for interpreting what we see on earth landforms on that appear to be related to climate changes help us calibrate and understand similar landforms on earth furthermore the range of microenvironments in the antarctic dry valleys helps us read the mars record

3381536 as early as 1993 when i personally briefed cia director james woolsey on the ufo matter we knew of on going secret projects to which president clinton and mr woolsey were denied access the senior counsel for the senate appropriations committee then headed by senator byrd d wv told me directly that upwards of 100 billion per year was going into so called black projects including ufo programs but that with a top secret clearance and a subpoena power he could not penetrate the veil of secrecy
3381537 the clintons refused further disclosure of the matter cia director woolsey frankly stated that they could not disclose programs over which they had no control or access mr woolsey and the clintons were shaken by the secrecy and the power behind it

3381541 we are pleased to see a recognized leader in fingerprint for laptops adopt our technology for their mobile phone and we are delighted to have the opportunity to support such a leading global manufacturer in their ongoing effort to bring greater levels of security and convenience to users of mobile devices
3381542 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3381543 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3381544 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3381545 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3381546 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3381547 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3381548 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3381549 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3381550 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3381551 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3381552 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3381553 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3381554 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3381560 is just unreal guys are walking around this place just in awe
3381561 i think its something that no one should have ever have to go through but lifes not fair so its never going to be about that kind of stuff at the end of the day it happened and we have to see if we can come to grips with that and the sooner we can kind of process it the better off were going to be
3381562 were just focusing primarily on trying to attend to barbara and her needs and the family trying to deal with the shock of losing todd and trying to go through the grieving process as well as dealing with the logistical issues of being in china
3381563 my family is my life so that distinction has been very easy for me im passionate about volleyball i like my job volleyball been wonderful for elisabeth and i but at this stage for me its very easy to focus on the task at hand which is taking care of my immediate family and once weve got that taken care of we can focus on other things in life
3381564 elisabeth and her family were very excited to come to the olympics as spectator and support the team
3381565 i think it happened quite quickly i dont think anything was said
3381566 to our knowledge no one had any prior contact with the individual until the act occurred
3381567 i believe that random act of violence are random acts of violence
3381568 there is no evidence here of any premeditation or anything it just seems unfortunately a case of the wrong place at the wrong time
3381569 but her injuries were significant but the surgical team has done a marvelous job of repairing the wounds and giving her the best possible chance of recovering
3381570 clearly elisabeth is a victim in this as well she is physically unscathed but having to deal with this event has been hard for her shes shown incredible strength and you know the last couple of days weve been having to talk through it obviously theres been a lot of tears and a lot of hugs but the fact that shes able to get amongst it and address what happened is a testament to whatever you want to call it her intestinal fortitude her character

3381591 the cruises are not intended to look for energy resources that is not a primary or even a secondary objective
3381592 however its inevitable because there are so few data in this area of the arctic there will be great interest in using this data
3381593 ultimately what is going to be needed is a more comprehensive ecological study of that region and some indication as to whether or not any technology that we have today is likely to be able to clean up spilled oil in that set of conditions

3381597 this is the first war that the united states has fought where so many of the people and resources involved arent of the military but from contractors
3381598 it was considered an all out imperative by the administration to keep troop levels low particularly in the beginning of the war and one way that was done was to shift money and manpower to contractors but that has exposed the military to greater risks from contractor waste and abuse
3381599 it is a shocking number but i still dont think it is the full cost
3381600 i dont think there have been any credible cost numbers for the iraq war there was so much money spent at the beginning of the war and nobody knows where it went
3381601 these new numbers point to the overall question when do you cross the line in terms of turning over too much of the public mission of defense to private firms
3381602 there are some things that are appropriate for private companies to do but others things that are not but we dont seem to have had a strategy for determining which was appropriate and which wasnt we have just handed over functions to contractors in a very haphazard way
3381603 the truman committee held 60 hearings on waste fraud and abuse

3381631 no hay nada que explicar me remito a los resultados del ltimo a o
3381632 es el m ximo candidato al oro porque la pista del torneo ol mpico es una de sus superficies predilectas se desenvuelve mejor y ha obtenido mejores resultados
3381633 cuando vi el cuadro hewitt aparec a como el rival m s fuerte pero sigo viendo el torneo complicado es cierto que ante hewitt especialista en esta superficie jugu un gran partido andreev es complicado tambi n igual que el resto si alguno de los favoritos ha perdido pues mejor
3381634 las sensaciones van y vienen y ojal que ahora pueda mantener el nivel no creo tampoco que haya habido mucha diferencia entre el primer partido y este el duelo contra starace me sirvi para coger el ritmo de la competici n
3381635 hay momentos en los que est s mejor y otros peor se hace duro este es el a o que menos he parado en casa que m s he competido y eso se acusa

3381647 ive already said that in accordance with the united nations code we are trying to force georgia which started the aggression to peace we find this tactic very effective and the only possible one i want to remind you that history has seen many examples of pacification by the aggressor in this way western countries did it seventy years ago and you know the tragic consequences of it i mean the lessons of the munich agreement of 1938
3381648 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country we are in the process of the destruction of world order as it was established after the end of the cold war and it is so obvious that the world has to react there is no way georgian people would ever live with occupation and annexation
3381649 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the twenty first century
3381650 what is going on there is so far beyond what the general public around the world is allowed to see you can not not react with compassion and pity for what the individuals of gaza is going through i want to reach there all of us desperately hope that there will be humanitarian aid increase and a port opened for these people to be able to go in and out of this giant open air prison

3381691 we would rather stay the way we are part of the unincorporated county
3381692 until the annexation started last december we thought we were ok
3381693 the only sure way of protecting our community is to incorporate
3381694 when you divide the county into a smaller piece again
3381695 and you have to see how supportive the county is because it is a player in this too
3381696 especially when you know the reasons for it to make sure they dont get annexed by st petersburg
3381697 its basically that they want to be left alone and the city of st petersburg wants a part of them
3381698 if im mayor baker im going to jump on this

3381712 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3381713 we admitted we were powerless over alcohol that our lives had become unmanageable
3381714 came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity
3381715 made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of god as we understood him
3381716 admitted to god to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs
3381717 were entirely ready to have god remove all these defects of character
3381718 made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all
3381719 made direct amends to such people wherever possible except when to do so would injure them or others
3381720 continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it
3381721 sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with god as we understood him praying only for knowledge of his will for us and the power to carry that out
3381722 having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs
3381723 dubai has already become the host to the highest number of supertowers in the world
3381724 we are going to add a few more to the citys growing skyline out of the 13 supertowers that are being designed by us five of them will be located in the uae and one in qatar
3381725 this is a unique technique never employed in supertowers dubai will be the first city in the world to have them implemented
3381726 the new buildings that we have designed for dubai can save energy by 40 to 60 per cent we can get to 0 level in energy consumption
3381727 we can in fact design buildings that can create energy for the city instead of consuming energy these buildings can actually contribute energy to the city
3381728 the new towers that we have planned the ac tower and ep towers will for the first time employ the latest architectural ideas and techniques they will be more energy efficient high density building and highly sustainable
3381729 for example a canal and waterway will pass through the ac towers and will create an open space for educational and theatrical activities
3381730 we have designed them to reflect on dubais rich heritage developed especially for dubai it is covered by ribbons of steel that helps it to utilise the solar energy and make it sustainable
3381731 the steel ribbon helps save energy besides the buildings have been designed to withstand wind pressure and manage the pressure more efficiently at peak it will tilt less than 1 25 metres either way
3381732 these will be very energy efficient intelligent and smart buildings there will be open garden spaces with water creating an oasis surrounding the six buildings
3381733 besides energy saved by one tower could be passed on to another this way these buildings complement the use of energy
3381734 this concept is unique and we are going to implement this in dubai for the first time with the new dubai based master developer
3381735 the ep 15 tower filters wind and light and the prism shape helps the tower to withstand the pressures of high wind and minimises risks
3381736 the six holes on the building helps pass the wind through and costs 25 per cent less
3381737 we believed that ultimately the third party chipset market would disappear that has indeed come to pass

3381740 sars believes there are many employers who have not yet complied with the legal requirement to submit their declarations within a 60 day period which started on 1 july this year
3381741 non compliant employers will make it very difficult for their workers to submit completed income tax returns when the filing period for individuals opens on 1 september 2008
3381742 a new emphasis is being placed on the information supplied by employers to sars in respect of the paye deducted from employees

3381744 given the strategic importance of mobile communications and the political economic and even military considerations one of chinas mobile communications operators is likely to implement a homegrown standard and the worldwide delay in the transition to 3g mobile communications provides china with time and room for improvement of its own technology

3381748 iets beloven is makkelijk iets concretiseren is een een pak moeilijker we hebben daar in het verleden al een aantal negatieve ervaringen mee gehad hoewel het voorstel van de directie op papier voldoet tien procent extra aanwervingen is niet slecht en kan zeker soelaas brengen om de werkdruk te verlagen maar de werknemers geloven het niet het is ook moeilijk te realiseren we spreken hier over laagbetaalde jobs die bovendien heel flexibel zijn je moet hier op elk moment van de dag beginnen en je hebt daardoor ook eigen vervoer nodig dat allemaal voor minder dan 1500 euro per maand zon mensen vind je niet direct dat is een gekend probleem op de luchthaven het is niet toevallig dat hier regelmatig jobbeurzen georganiseerd worden
3381749 we zitten in een patsstelling traditioneel worden dergelijke problemen dan opgelost door daar een financi le compensatie aan te koppelen nochtans gaan de problemen daar niet over maar als je mensen wil overtuigen van je goede bedoelingen zal er iets tegenover moeten staan er was iets beloofd 5 cent anci niteitsverhoging om de drie jaar maar dat was veel te mager
3381750 grote flexibiliteit hoge werkdruk en een karig loon dat daar tegenover staat flightcare was vroeger sabena waar de lonen wel goed waren aviapartner is een priv bedrijf waar er weinig problemen waren tot het drie jaar geleden door een durfkapitalist werd overgekocht die persen de mensen uit als citroenen ze testen iedere keer uit hoe ver ze kunnen gaan de staking van zondagavond was dan ook geen verrassing het was enkel wachten tot er een staking zou uitbreken wij hebben het afgelopen jaar telkens de directie gewaarschuwd dat er iets moest gebeuren
3381751 een thomas cook vliegtuig komt aan met 150 pasagiers een ploeg bagagisten trekt daar naar toe om de bagageruimte leeg te halen vroeger bestond die ploeg uit vijf werknemers nu nog uit vier of drie zon vliegtuigruimte is ettelijke meters lang als je met onvoldoende werkkrachten bent moet je die koffers heel ver gooien je moet dat werk bovendien op je knie n doen in heel weinig tijd in volle vakantieperiode is het extra druk en er wordt geen extra personeel voorzien jobstudenten inschakelen is moeilijk want het werk is te gevaarlijk en vraagt toch wat technische kennis
3381752 het vertrouwen is geschonden het zal niet makkelijk zijn om in deze firma een duurzame oplossing te vinden de werknemers voelen zich niet gerespecteerd een paar weken geleden werd dan nog een consultancybureau ingeschakeld dat berekende dat er hier eigenlijk nog vijftien man te veel werkt dat was olie op het vuur men heeft geen voeling meer met wat er leeft op de werkvloer drie jaar geleden leidde de vorige gedelegeerd bestuurder nvdr alex verougstraete het bedrijf ook al heel strak maar die deed dat tenminste nog met kennis van zaken maar sinds een investeringsmaatschappij 3i nvdr het bedrijf overnam gebeurt dat allemaal veel anoniemer het is hier echt niet makkelijk werken hoor
3381753 ik begrijp de onvrede bij de passagiers en ik wil mijn excuses aan bieden bij hen maar men moet begrijpen dat de situatie hier voortdurend verslechterd en dat het niet om wat meer loon draait maar wel om een veel te hoge werkdruk

3381761 if your mission ends and you have come back as far as my tenure as the inspector general of police is concerned there will be no extension of a peacekeeping mission for any single security outfit in the gambia
3381762 you must be loyal to the president and serve the gambian people if you cannot be loyal to the president its high time for you leave the service before you get sacked there will be no compromise for those who are not loyal to the president even if you get 20 phds as far as you are not loyal because as security officers you have to be loyal to the president and your country the gambia and promotions within the security outfits will be based on merit
3381763 you are security officers you must be willing to serve your country and be loyal to the president of the republic

3381773 to demonstrate our seriousness mend has rejected an offer of 20 million bribe by the federal government through its chief negotiator the secretary to the federal government
3381774 we suggest that the government puts that money to better use through the moribund national emergency management agency nema by providing relief materials such as tents blankets medicine and potable water to the displaced agge community in bayelsa state
3381775 unprecedented deadly attacks on the expatriate staff of julius berger inside abuja and other parts of the country until they comply
3381776 the federal governments policy on crimes and criminals of all forms is well known the activities and utterance of criminal gangs such as the one attributed to the so called mend are totally condemned and government will continue to ensure that the perpetrators face the wrath of law
3381777 the government policy is not to negotiate with the criminals who kidnap threaten and murder innocent nigerians and foreigners alike falsely invoking nobler causes for their nefarious act

3381779 i put in a tremendous amount of work meeting all these requirements when i could have put that work into the actual game and made it even a little more polished little bit better

3381784 the launch of the fta is not an end in itself but a beginning of a process
3381785 the focus should be on addressing the real economic constraints that hinder deeper integration in our region
3381786 this will complicate the process of establishing a sadc customs union especially agreeing on a common external tariff
3381787 we therefore need to re evaluate our priorities given the challenges and endeavour to find practical solutions to deepen sadc integration
3381788 you will remember that name because i think pretty soon its going to be your surname britney brand
3381789 i dont feel like they show me on the hills sticking up for myself they edit that out in real life though im bubbly and fun and talkative and when you see me on the show im always sitting there and sad but im fine with it because its not my show
3381790 its so different from a reality show because i have lines to memorize the hills definitely helped just in terms of being in front of the cameras and being used to crews watching me it made it a lot more comfortable on a film set
3381791 as soon as they started talking about it back in february we saw crime jump
3381792 criminals know were short staffed now were seeing people coming here from richmond and oakland because they think its fertile ground
3381793 we have over 100 000 passengers per day even the 10 percent cuts that the ap is reporting thats 90 000 passengers per day
3381794 so unlke some smaller airports that may suffer a much greater cut its very different at sky harbor
3381795 a lot of passengers are in the airport theyre spending more time in the airport than they used to getting there early
3381796 and so the retail stores the shops the restaurants the food vendors a lot of people are buying food to take on the airplane so no danger of anyone closing
3381797 wed withdraw a bond if the customer instructs us to do so and this must be done in writing

3381800 we do not object to filing the expanded form with the i r s
3381801 we are not asking congress to prevent the expanded form from taking effect we have one issue only to prevent public disclosure of personal financial information
3381802 i finally get to the point where im making 150 grand and they want to put my name and address on the form so the lawyer next door who makes a million dollars a year can laugh at me
3381803 a hundred and fifty thousand here is not the same as it is in dubuque iowa or west texas
3381804 if as requested professional associations like the n f l are allowed to keep salary information from the public other tax exempt groups would ask for the same treatment this would be contrary to the goal of increasing transparency and accountability from tax exempt organizations to the public
3381805 we believe that people who need to know about salaries paid to n f l staff are the owners who already can access that information no valid purpose is served to supply the same information to the general public
3381806 the i r s obviously wants to look at it for excessive compensation perhaps or insider dealing we dont believe theres any of that taking place and that the disclosure will lead to problems with our employees both at the human resources level and outside interest levels
3381807 recognizing vehicles at the head of the class for safety helps consumers distinguish the best overall choices without having to sort through multiple test results
3381808 audi has been working hard to design vehicles that qualify for top safety pick
3381809 by requesting tests outside of our normal schedule companies are able to get test results out to consumers faster and theyre able to publicize that theyre offering their customers state of the art safety more manufacturers are requesting early tests of new models or tests of models in categories we dont usually evaluate and we accommodate this whenever we can

3381812 theyre afraid because if they get detected by ice through joe arpaio thats a death sentence for a lot of those people because they have to go back and they have to come back and risk their lives again
3381813 he is so feared by our people that the minute they see the lights of any patrol cars our people begin to cry and to tremble at the fact that they may be stopped and arrested
3381814 i think we should go out and firmly oppose what hes doing
3381815 but we need to be very careful not to create the atmosphere of getting back at sheriff joe
3381816 it is important that we do not get back at him because then we become the animal that we believe he is

3381839 enterprise risk management standard amp poors to apply enterprise risk analysis to corporate ratings
3381840 s amp ps decision to apply erm analysis to its corporate ratings further thrusts risk management into the spotlight and ultimately is a good thing for companies and investors alike
3381841 with dramatic corporate events continuing to make headlines around the world from numerous product recalls to rogue bank trading activity to the continued fallout from the sub prime mortgage crisis one thing is clear executive management teams and their boards are fundamentally rethinking their focus on risk management together with our partners sap is uniquely positioned to help our customers implement a forward thinking strategic risk management program
3381842 our cfo survey shows that the ability to manage enterprise risk is a key differentiator for companies that outperform their peers in revenue and stock price growth but only half of the companies have any sort of formalized risk management program in place
3381843 the critical risks vary from one industry to the next
3381844 protiviti has developed risk and kri catalogs for sap grc risk management that enable enterprises to ensure that they not only have their key risks identified but that they also have the continuous kri monitoring in place this approach of embedding risk monitoring into existing business processes across the enterprise not only reduces the exposure to unwanted risk events but also builds a strong risk culture within the company more specifically integration of risk management with enterprise performance management is where the real action is
3381845 new enterprise performance management solutions from business objects enable customers to link strategy to execution

3381926 since he spoke longer than expected he spilled over into the networks next half hour time period since network time is always divided into blocks of half hours and hours this meant the network had to fill whatever part of the half hour nixon left
3381927 a few of our own correspondents and an outsider or two to discuss the speech the audience had just heard on this night following nixon i and a few others got the unpleasant duty to discuss his speech until the beginning of the next hour

3381962 este comportamento continua sendo reflexo do aquecimento do setor de constru o devido s vendas para a auto constru o e as pequenas reformas a expectativa para o segundo semestre que o setor continue aquecido

3381975 de spaanse wielerbond heeft enkele verklaringen uitgegeven over doping maar ik zou ze niet te serieus nemen
3381976 hoe veel zijn er in spanje gepakt ik denk dat er onder de nieuwe dopingwet nog geen n is aangeklaagd
3381977 het ziet er niet naar uit dat de sporters die daarin verstrikt zijn werkelijk vervolgd gaan worden het toont aan dat het probleem in de cultuur zit en dat veel spaanse sporters bereid zijn naar dope te grijpen
3381978 we gaan eerst in de reglementen kijken of het wel mogelijk is om sjoerd in te zetten
3381979 nu gaan we hem elke dag behandelen het is nog te vroeg om te zeggen of hij voor de finale fit is of niet

3381986 hit me in the face you got to stab it and then you gotta eat it quick real quick
3381987 in a few days i would like lose my mind and it would be trying to explode on me
3381988 i got in a fight with the guards a lot of times you know tried to kill a few
3381989 but at the time they was turning into insects and i wanted to kill them
3381990 they was acting just like the guards but they were aliens and i had to kill the aliens they were attacking the world
3381991 she got into the front seat drivers seat and i had the knife on her and i sat in the back seat and
3381992 you jumped in the car and pulled a knife on her
3381993 just turned her around and she didnt move and i stabbed her four times
3381994 not in pain i didnt want her to be suffering in pain
3381995 you think if somebody stabbed you four times in the back youre not gonna suffer
3381996 you know she was still alive when you drove away
3381997 what was going through your mind at the time when you were talking to him on the phone
3381998 its like you telling me how to find a frisbee that youve tossed and lost
3381999 if he knew what he was doing at the time and he was competent to be executed at the time that sentence was given why shouldnt he die for what he did
3382000 i think the evidence points overwhelmingly to the fact that he was insane at the time
3382001 he told them exactly what hed done he even told them where hed thrown out the murder weapon so they could find that on the side of the road
3382002 i think the fact that greg thompson can remember things does not detract from the fact that at the time of the crime he was suffering delusions and he was hearing voices
3382003 thats correct never brought up at the trial because the trial attorneys did not consult with the proper people that would have seen those clear signs of gregs psychosis at the time the clear signs of psychosis that everybody agrees about right now
3382004 i dont believe that he was insane at the time he killed her uh now i dont know hes been sitting on death row 22 years almost anyone might be insane after this period of time
3382005 its just not right that he was given a death sentence and it not carried out
3382006 it destroyed my family basically my mother certainly never got over it
3382007 and of course what happened is a terrible tragedy but the point now is that greg thompson is psychotic that hes delusional that he does not have a rational understanding of why the state seeks to execute him
3382008 well see i wrote some songs and sent them to hollywood
3382009 what if i said to you there was no check
3382010 what if i said to you though there was no check its in your head not in your name
3382011 no there was a check it wasnt in my head you know
3382012 are you a con man are you acting for me
3382013 no im serious this is me this is who i am
3382014 how can you be sure that greg thompson is not just acting up that hes not just pretending
3382015 for over 20 years prison doctors have administered very powerful anti psychotic drugs to greg thompson i dont know of any doctor that would prescribe or force that type of medication upon a person unless they believed they were truly psychotic
3382016 it doesnt take away his mental illness hes always insane but what it does is that it hides that insanity
3382017 well i had a i made a choice years ago that if i were to get to that point id rather be normal than insane
3382018 because it hurts im tired of being mentally ill you know so if they want to kill me at the end then they kill me at the end
3382019 i am a christian and we are to forgive people its hard
3382020 but you want him to die for what he did
3382021 im on drugs right now and i feel good im not afraid when i when these drugs wear off a little bit ill be afraid again
3382022 if you were executed what do you think would happen to you afterwards what comes next
3382023 because if the dead can speak that means you got thought in the grave you got thoughts going on in the grave i dont know about that
3382024 acho que esses s o bons princ pios para delimitar o problema e dar fim a esta dram tica situa o estes princ pios podem ser usados tanto pela ge rgia quanto pela oss tia do sul

3382028 who are these near kin of yours whose love is obligatory upon us

3382030 behold my ahl al bayt are like the ark of noah whoever embarked on it was saved and whoever turned away from it perished
3382031 the need to belong in groups is paramount to young learners and exclusion is something they see as the end of the world
3382032 bullying of this kind can be quite insidious it can just be a look that a child is given children feel under immense pressure to look right and having the key brands is part of that
3382033 young people are image conscious and a lot of bullying is based on appearance targeting others for not having the right look accessory or brand is unfortunately all too common but it is precisely the sort of behaviour beatbullying can help change

3382043 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3382044 this should be unacceptable to all the democratic countries of the world and should draw us together in universal condemnation of russian aggression
3382045 first go and see if all the people are asleep

3382047 the one who hasnt slept and doesnt sleep sees us even if people dont see us
3382048 do you not fear he who neither sleeps nor is heedless of anything that happens
3382049 allah the almighty has said o son of adam so long as you call upon me and hope in me i shall forgive you for what you have done and i shall not mind

3382084 im drawing attention here to what i believe to be the fundamental meta level source of all the divisions between christians the issue of authority
3382085 your position leaves us with no authoritative determination of what is orthodoxy and what is heresy one mans orthodoxy is another mans heresy and there is no one to provide the authoritative adjudication if no one can provide the authoritative determination of orthodoxy and heresy then we are left with theological relativism

3382091 andy would love to send out information to all the members but cant because the government took all the asd computers and therefore the asd database with all the names phones numbers and email addresses

3382102 i went to church here and im sure the cynics say well you know it was just a state sponsored church and thats true
3382103 on the other hand it gave me a chance to say to the chinese people religion wont hurt you you ought to welcome religious people and it gave me a chance to say to the government why dont you register the underground churches and give them a chance to flourish and hu listened politely i cant read his mind but i do know that every time i met with him i pressed the point
3382104 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings so america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists
3382105 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
3382106 we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs

3382147 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3382148 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3382149 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3382150 the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscar

3382176 interestingly alzheimers disease pathology was associated with physical frailty in older persons both with and without dementia
3382177 the level of frailty was approximately two times higher in a person with a high level of ad pathology compared with a person with a low level of ad pathology
3382178 together both of these studies suggest that frailty can be an early indicator of alzheimers disease pathology and may appear before memory loss
3382179 these findings raise the possibility that alzheimers disease may contribute to frailty or that frailty and alzheimers disease share a common cause we theorize that the accumulation of these plaques and tangles in the brain could affect the areas of the brain responsible for motor skills and simple movements years before the development of dementia

3382186 plants are dying out at the bottom of their ranges and at the tops of their ranges they seem to be growing in and doing much better
3382187 the only thing that could explain this happening across the entire face of the mountain would be a change in the local climate
3382188 i was surprised by how nice the data looked and how unambiguous the signal was
3382189 it is clear that ecosystems can respond rather rapidly to climate change
3382190 the plants should still be in a recovery phase where they are growing back in
3382191 but they have stopped recovering and now are dying which these plants should not be doing
3382192 by protecting pacific leatherback turtle nesting habitats from logging local communities can increase their income while preserving their native landscapes ability to provide clean water healthy food and shelter

3382196 this funding would allow the locals to develop and diversify their businesses the funding source would be forward sales of avoided deforestation carbon markets credits secured by securing the source of the logged trees on the beach
3382197 in other words by securing the concession where the cut logs are originating and using this concession as an avoided deforestation project the developer can fund the protection of the leatherback turtles

3382336 joss is a big supporter of barack obama and was very excited to be asked to do this for him
3382337 he sent a personal message asking her to get on board
3382338 he has always admired her music and thinks she is the perfect choice because of her unique appeal to black and white voters
3382339 its a singles night at one of the local churches i thought you could attend
3382340 well it was just so nice of all these people to come out for my 90th birthday it was her 86th i dont even know most of them
3382341 at least shes somewhere where her mind is completely back now and its only selfish of us to want her to stick around in pain just so we feel better
3382342 she was a friend to everyone and a mentor to many the first to arrive with food for the sick and the last to leave when someone was in need of a comforting hand
3382343 at the moment im a bit curvier having done the
3382344 obviously im still vain thats still in there i wanted to look my best and i wore a bit of fake tan but what woman wouldnt if theyre being honest
3382345 i did strive to have my most perfect body and in moments when i lack confidence that voice is always there waiting to tell me
3382346 it used to be the loudest voice in my head but now i just tell it shut up
3382347 i dont have a strict diet any more i eat cake crisps sugar free chocolate and chips if i want to i cant be bothered to follow a gruelling food plan im a petite person and if i eat relatively healthily ill stay that way

3382349 we want community input on the size and cost of the middle school
3382350 we know a lot of people are interested and we hope they show up
3382351 we are delighted that singh is kinng has had a fantastic opening weekend

3382354 from my perspective i had been expecting oil to level off because thats the way the futures markets were pricing it so it seemed that if that happened headline inflation would abate a bit at least
3382355 now with the decline in energy prices and assuming that sticks that clearly improves the inflation outlook relative to what i was earlier expecting
3382356 we shouldnt lose sight of the fact that energy prices have risen a lot over the last several years all told so i dont think at least from my perspective that its going to provide a huge amount of stimulus to economic activity at these levels
3382357 if you wait till you have conclusive evidence you run the risk of waiting too long and so the real message is youve got to be willing at some point along the way to say you know i have enough confidence in my outlook its time to go
3382358 the thing about this most recent rally is that it has pushed people to look forward
3382359 youre going to continue to get write offs from the financial sector
3382360 investors will either look past that or periodically they are going to stare at that with shock and cause sell offs
3382361 weve been able to take advantage of the situation clearly
3382362 this has been a great environment for boutiques and regional firms
3382363 but people are very opportunistic when attracting good people and theres a lot of hiring going on right now
3382364 this particular market condition affords rare recruiting opportunities and we are able to find people and make the types of economic agreements with them that one doesnt normally see
3382365 weve really started to see some high quality talent come out and looking for jobs
3382366 we have been a direct beneficiary of the dislocations in the larger firms
3382367 i think you were built for this game both mentally and physically
3382368 this should be a wholesome development for the us for it promises both political stability for the worlds largest country and continuing opportunities for the us to export to and invest in the worlds fastest growing economy
3382369 you want to know what was the trigger i wonder if there was something about his wifes illness elizabeth edwards has advanced breast cancer that somehow got him to cheat or contributed at least i think we get so caught up in good or bad is somebody a good person or bad person cheating is wrong but i think there are multiple factors was he doing it because he had a fear of losing his wife there are lots of different reasons
3382370 here we go again and is this similar or different to all the others politicians whove had affairs that was my question about the whole thing
3382371 there are many politicians who are targeted theyre powerful sometimes theyre good looking so they are going to be in a situation that other quote normal men may not be in
3382372 he couldnt stop himself in a sense you know the career of politics involves all sorts of change variety novelty risk uncertainty they tend to be natural rule breakers the folks who go in there if they followed the strict rules theyd have a 9 to 5 ordinary job theres all the admirers the opportunities this is why it happens so frequently it attracts a certain kind of person into that lifestyle
3382373 a lot of these women must know their men are going to be targeted maybe they make a decision my relationship is more important than some woman and im not going to allow some fling to interfere with my relationship and its a business relationship for a lot of these people in addition to being an emotional relationship
3382374 heres my challenge if you are using outbrain use the social features the reasons its a value add to your readers but more importantly if you are on the outbrain network youre getting links from sites who are being social youre taking from others and not giving back and thats in part greedy in part just not very cool
3382375 i think it will be a number of years before they start paying taxes again the mayor told a news conference
3382376 look at those losses they can carry them forward for a number of years
3382377 i am worried about the states bond rating it could start to fall if the state doesnt do something about its budget problems bloomberg said noting his administration has already deepened spending cuts
3382378 if they the state cut back were going to feel it no question about it bloomberg said
3382379 they can find a way to economize more he added later
3382380 when we were doing a research group for the pitch someone said what you really need to do is give everyone in britain a heart attack
3382381 were bringing heart attacks to life in living rooms because understanding how one could feel might mean the difference between life and death
3382382 we are trying to stop this as soon as possible
3382383 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country
3382384 we have to go to the shelter because there are russian planes flying over the presidential palace here sorry
3382385 at the moment our troops are pushing out capturing and disarming groups of georgian law enforcement agencies which have been surrounded in the capital of south ossetia
3382386 the 1992 treaty which georgia signed among others clearly defines the limits of responsibility of the russian peacekeeping contingent and is doesnt have any tasks of invading the georgian territory
3382387 inflicted damage on operational systems troops and military facilities of georgia
3382388 overnight as many as 50 russian bombers were reported operating simultaneously over georgia targeting civilian populations in cities and villages as well as radio and telecommunications sites
3382389 during their mop up operations in south ossetia georgian commandos have thrown hand grenades into the basements where civilians were hiding
3382390 in the beginners mind there are many possibilities in the experts there are few
3382391 im not sure theres any issue where they differ as much as this sometimes we complain in politics that democrats and republicans run to the center and they copy each other with their proposals at least in health care we dont have to worry about that
3382392 our proposal is to give every family in america a 5 000 refundable tax credit and they take that tax credit and that money a refundable tax credit to go across state lines to go any place in america and go online and pick out the insurance policy they want
3382393 democrats want the government to make the choices thats a fundamental difference
3382394 but if youre one of the 45 million americans who dont have health insurance then you will have it available to you no one will be turned away because of a pre existing condition or illness
3382395 everyone will be able to buy into a new health insurance plan thats similar to the one that every federal employee from a postal worker in iowa to a congressman in washington currently has for themselves
3382396 while sen obama wants to build on top of the employer sponsored insurance system sen mccain wants to build away from it and move more people to the individual insurance market
3382397 is there a way of disabling the found new hardware wizard in windows xp embedded
3382398 casual workers are caught in a double bind low pay means they need to work more hours taking on more work shifts but irregular hours shift work short call ins and minimal notice of scheduling are undermining their ability to balance work and family obligations
3382399 life is a scramble for casual workers and recent provincial policy changes have made getting by even tougher
3382400 bc is often promoted as the best place to invest
3382401 but if it is also going to be the best place to work the provincial government needs to rethink its approach
3382402 what am i going to do with you and where the bad word bad word are you from

3382409 this isnt the first time this has happened and it doesnt surprise me anymore
3382410 politics takes precedence over sport with the iranians and the olympic spirit is as far from them as east is far from west
3382411 my heart goes out to the iranian athletes in the athens olympics one of their sportsmen who was a gold medal favorite had to pull out because he was drawn against an israeli
3382412 theres no place for this kind of behavior in the ol ympic movement and its a shame it continues
3382413 when i was young i never neeeeeeded anyonnnne and makin love was just for fun those days are gone all by my selllllllllllf dont wanna be all by my selllllllllllllllllllf anyyyymooooooooore
3382414 oh my god i love josh i am majorly totally butt crazy in love with josh
3382415 that little hole of epicurean knowledge that i never knew i was missing yes yes it is now complete
3382416 at what price can someone answer this simple question for me why is it ok for georgia to declare its independence from russia but not ok for south ossetia to do the same from georgia georgia should have thought about the ramifications of their actions before acting
3382417 it proved very difficult for most of the combinations out there the rest of the team did a great job and its great to have that silver medal
3382418 its like saying once you get into willy wonkas chocolate factory and youre in the garden where everythings edible you have it all

3382423 it was a common perception that there be no contact with the witnesses in this case
3382424 reasonable minds can differ with what judge mcduffee was talking about my recollection and its my earnest belief that the judge carved out family
3382425 i think people from watching the simple life where i was playing this airhead rich brat kind of character years later people still picture me like that even though im completely different from that

3382540 ok what the hell happened just now were the definitive foodies weve been to bouley boulud etc why am i feeling like a complete fool right now why cant i think straight i couldnt even listen properly to what he was saying
3382541 you know for the life of me i cant figure out i need a pen to mark through the options on the menu and then select through a process of elimination looking at these options and food descriptions and with his words still ringing in my ears i just cant think straight
3382542 ok so we must let the left brain take over now lets start reading aloud what these options are and what they could be like as we start hearing our own voices things may become clearer
3382543 so you obviously know about cinderella her plain looking step sisters and the ugly wicked witch
3382544 excuse me sir but theres no wicked witch in cinderella just a fairy godmother you are mixing up cinderella with snow white
3382545 precisely if dark chocolate is cinderella and milk chocolate is the plain step sister then white chocolate is the witch that has nothing to do with the story so you see my point is white chocolate isnt chocolate
3382546 thats persuasive enough for me sir ill see what i can do though for a moment i was wondering about the potency of those rhone valley grapes

3382556 the polar bears habitat is melting at an alarming rate this year the polar bear was put on the endangered species list

3382563 when the athletes understand and feel that they are getting faster and stronger thats when they buy into the program

3382565 the team does it for no more than 10 to 20 minutes with primary focus on the hips legs and groins
3382566 i think its a huge factor in our program in terms of injury prevention
3382567 i hope to be back in the competition circuit soon
3382568 i definitely do it for the love of riding and dont receive a lot of money for it

3382573 unless we make radical changes in the way we live by the time the youth of 2008 reach my age the world may well have become a rather inhospitable place
3382574 in many developing countries in particular youth especially girls and young women are often responsible for farming finding water and collecting fuel wood these tasks will be rendered more difficult and will take even more time away from education or productive activities as climate change affects the availability of water agricultural productivity and the survival of ecosystems

3382579 he was an extremely talented man very knowledgeable about music but his temperament was his undoing
3382580 even if someone made a minor suggestion hed turn on him and say what do you know about music he fought with almost everyone because of this he sat at home most of his life and wasted his talent but the body of work he has produced small as it might be ranks among the best in hindi film music
3382581 its true he wouldnt let musically unqualified people interfere with his work but the popular perception of him being stubborn is not right
3382582 sajjad had a rational explanation for every action of his you had to know him to recognise his tremendous erudition the fact that he was far superior to every other music director in the industry
3382583 hed tell the producer ive created a tune which even lata cant sing
3382584 i take pride in the fact that i lifted your tune not that of some second or third rater
3382585 all of us including myself turned to some source for inspiration
3382586 this sajjad never needed to do each note of the music he composed was his own
3382587 the mandolin bore the halo of a ravi shankar sitar or an ali akbar sarod his playing is that of a mighty maestro
3382588 but what is far more important is that to the last day of his life my father was happy there was no bitterness no regrets he could have been hugely successful made piles of money but the only thing he wanted was to be acknowledged as a great musician and to live life on his own terms and i think he achieved that

3382602 there are use cases we are looking at supporting some are working today dashboard builder for example lets you lasso crystal reports content and drag and drop it into a dashboard you can add xcelsius components and even web intelligence docs
3382603 going forward we are looking at things like moving a web intelligence query into voyager for slicing and dicing work sets from polestar into web intelligence for someone else other then the casual information user to then create scheduled reports for publishing et cetera
3382604 the characters view blogs with some suspicion as i think newspapers tend to do

3382606 the safety and effectiveness of the hpv vaccine gardasil as a preventive cervical cancer treatment for girls are questioned in a report
3382607 etfos own research shows that elementary public school teachers worked over 115 hours longer than their secondary colleagues this school year
3382608 one of the key reasons why elementary teachers have a greater workload is that they receive far less preparation time than secondary school teachers
3382609 this results in elementary teachers having 37 minutes less time every day for lesson preparation marking and student assessment less preparation time means teachers have less time to tailor their efforts to best meet the needs of each individual child
3382610 as we move toward winter the rising cost of fuel is weighing heavy on the minds of our constituents who use oil or natural gas to heat their homes i believe this winter will be the most difficult on record for those families who bare the brunt of high fuel cost through home heating bills
3382611 of much greater importance is the smear campaign being launched against the country s human rights tribunals in the mainstream media and by unhinged bloggers
3382612 until canada has a free press or at least one that doesn t practise defamation and censorship to serve israel they will continue to be an unfortunate necessity
3382613 we will go with whatever the members decide but it would be harder without a guaranteed poker machine revenue stream

3382617 on the 4th august 2001 my 15 year old nephew timothy winkler also took his own life because of constant bullying whilst also attending kadina high school at lismore
3382618 how many more young lives and families will be destroyed before this bullying is addressed and eradicated
3382619 when someone takes their own life the pain and suffering does not stop with the death of that person
3382620 its the loved ones left behind who suffer through no fault of their own
3382621 they suffer guilt complexes like why didnt i see it coming where did i fail but the truth is it is not their fault
3382622 my brother timothys father battled with this along with the rest of the family until it became too much for him on 22 4 2003 when he took his own life to stop his own pain and suffering
3382623 surely the objective is to stamp out bullying and in the process save lives
3382624 why when this person asks you whether he the accused wanted them in the hospital or cemetery did you answer cemetery
3382625 i am committed to making australia the most asia literate country in the collective west

3382628 he knew what he wanted in life he aspired to great things and had big dreams he had a love for life that infected everyone who met him
3382629 he was always asking questions curious to know everything about the world i look around this room today i know his impact has been felt
3382630 im angry doujon i am so angry that you were taken from us so abruptly and far too early
3382631 but mostly doujon i am grateful that i had the privilege of knowing you and im grateful for every moment we shared
3382632 the thought of being reunited with my brother is on my mind every second of the day to think i will never be able to be with him touch him again or go to him in a time of need will haunt me
3382633 his presence was unique no matter where he was or who he was with he always managed to light up a room
3382634 it started the day doujon came into this world and continued with their shared interest in coffee outings midnight chats and dancing lessons around the kitchen
3382635 yes there may be some impact on public hospitals but our estimate is that it is likely to be modest

3382638 gerard was like a child in many ways he was a good happy jolly boy
3382639 these kids have said we want you to come with us but no explanation was given
3382640 the victim said no and the seven year old allegedly has produced an implement and stabbed her in the hand
3382641 weve spoken to the child and his parents about the incident but there wont be any formal action taken
3382642 a matter has to be referred whenever a child is deemed at risk
3382643 both the victim and the offender are under 16 and there are mandatory reporting requirements but i dont know whether this one fits the bill
3382644 the philly soul online store will only ship orders within the united states and canada
3382645 just in time for all of the fun this year
3382646 if we play like we played this week well beat australia
3382647 this is a very exciting stage but a starting stage the key is to turn up to every single test match like we turned up to this one with the structures and the players weve got the type of attack weve had in this game the way weve gone about the game and the way weve been up for it every single day and the emotions that the guys have come out with its not far away from a perfect start its the way we want to play our cricket in the future
3382648 what we have got to do is look at the australians and learn from them they are on it every day and every session that is what we have to do and my main drive with this team is to be on top of it every day and make sure we do not have any comfort zones

3382661 new negotiations have started but at this moment differences are still too deep to be bridged quickly the striking workers at flightcare the airports other handling company have decided to carry on their solidarity actions as long as negotiations at aviapartner continue
3382662 for the moment the situation is still going on we have just started a meeting with the unions in which the management is further discussing a proposal which was put on the table early yesterday evening
3382663 we hope that based on this pre proposal we will come to an agreement with the unions this morning and that it will go to a union vote around lunchtime the management was very disappointed that they started the strike despite a peace agreement
3382664 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3382665 our service men and women are unsung heroes and the help for heroes challenge match at twickenham is a great way of showing support for those injured armed service personnel
3382666 this is clearly a valuable cause and the england cricket team fully supports the outstanding work carried out by the joint services rehabilitation centre
3382667 i think this series is obviously the one that meant the most to us it has taken a very long time to get hold of the trophy
3382668 so far i think this is the most successful south african season we have probably ever had
3382669 so credit to the team in the way they have developed the collective team effort in regards to performance over that period of time
3382670 i think weve learned one or two little things in terms of what we need to do to keep improving
3382671 when you go to pakistan then to india and then you come here those are three massive challenges within a period of time
3382672 and when you have won two out of the three series and drawn the other one that is a side that is definitely on the up
3382673 i think the confidence that we have gained from winning the series is an important facet for us going to australia
3382674 that has been the really tough place to play skill wise mentally and physically
3382675 but hopefully with a bit of luck we can keep everybody fit and if the form is good early tour in australia and we can round the year off with a win there that would be a great achievement
3382676 it is still too early to say anything about the differences in their leadership
3382677 when a man is captain for five years there is a certain trait that is there a legacy that he has left
3382678 the team plays in a certain way i think kevin will find that over time he has obviously had success in his first game but he seems to be a much more positive confident guy on the field
3382679 michael was more controlled in the way he did things kevin is more seen on the field
3382680 he might just as well meet the challenges that are coming up for him in a very positive way
3382681 i think it is going to take time to see his style emerging and how england change under his leadership

3382685 the batsmen did not do well and that cost us the series the middle order not getting the runs proved critical our batting was never consistent
3382686 it was not easy to pick runs when ajantha mendis and muttiah muralitharan were bowling together the pressure they created made it tough
3382687 i returned from holiday today to discover i and my family will continue for the next five years to be deprived of live cricket on television
3382688 will it never again be a birthright to be able to see test matches as they happen from our living rooms
3382689 if you could indulge me momentarily i would like to explain the impact on one life of your ongoing agreements with satellite broadcasters
3382690 i am a lifelong cricketer and cricket spectator who had selfishly perhaps hoped to pass on some of the pleasure i have derived from the sport to my young sons
3382691 i take them to watch club cricket when time allows and encourage them to play themselves too in the back garden or at the village ground
3382692 it was part of my initial strategy too though to foster their interest via the spectacle of international and first class cricket on tv
3382693 as a modest earner satellite subscriptions are and will remain out of reach and i have discovered more and more that without prominence through live broadcast children conclude the sport is an irrelevance
3382694 the absence of cricket on television in the young minds of those whose parents cannot beam in satellite means it must be a minority interest
3382695 instead they will choose a more mainstream pastime football inevitably and frustratingly occupying their brains their hearts their ambition and their entire bedroom wall space
3382696 i foolishly hoped you might with twenty20 riches in your pockets be able to rectify this situation by rising above what was once apparently the financial necessity of broadcast deals and start to properly look after the future of english cricket
3382697 i understand from reports that 30million is to be made available from your new broadcast revenue to the grassroots game
3382698 what i do not understand though is the point in that benevolence when your method of fundraising has already eliminated the majority of those aspiring cricketers and potential spectators who might otherwise have benefited
3382699 you are building the facilities of the future for people who will not exist brilliant
3382700 as an optimist i try to hope that another five years hence something will have changed
3382701 public service broadcasters may no longer be obsessing quite so madly over soap operas costume dramas and reality programming to the exclusion of a sport once defining to england now largely historical
3382702 the ecb may press the point even forsake the myopic removal of cricket from terrestrial schedules realising at last that millions of competitors and consumers have long been lost
3382703 it will be too late for me and mine of course at the ages of 11 and 13 by 2013 cricket will probably be a distant memory of a whim which took hold and passed during a few hours of a sunny afternoon back in summer 2005
3382704 they might never have been switched on to cricket of course it might just not have been their thing i just wish they and millions of others had been given the chance
3382705 yours in resignation and isolation awaiting grandchildren and other miracles
3382706 crafted himself an image as one of those rare reformers who succeeds
3382707 the idea of barack obama as a reformer is a great lie
3382708 obamas campaign got the other three candidates disqualified as well
3382709 when you get criticism as long as its fair and honest players will always accept it and kevin can do that its quite insightful how he sees the game and if he gives feedback it will be fair and honest
3382710 if that was the situation and they thought they should cop it then theyd be happy to take it they would take it on the chin and respond to it
3382711 i think players like to be supported because its a tough environment out there
3382712 there will be a case to be supportive but also there will be times when he will have words with players because that will be the right thing to do at the time
3382713 what they will know with kevin is that hell be in there scrapping with them he will put his own neck on the line and hell get stuck in and go with it and i think theyll respect him for that
3382714 since ive been here he works harder than anyone else on his game and hes full of beans and energy
3382715 in your first test match youre going to be like that
3382716 what kp is saying is that if you can have 11 blokes that work on their game then youre a tough side to beat and thats the challenge for everybody within the set up
3382717 the captain will lead that and its up to everybody else to make sure we get ourselves in the right place before we start any game and also stay there throughout the game
3382718 they werent really reservations it could have been anybody that we were asking to be captain
3382719 the coach and the future captain need to talk about how they see the way forward because if theres some real fundamental clashes there you want to be able to sort them out at the front end and decide where youre going
3382720 kevin captained true to his word he said he was going to want to play positive cricket but also thats got to be linked to being disciplined trying to be aggressive and take the game to the opposition
3382721 i thought at times he did and its worked well for us and weve come out on top its something to build on and its a great start for everybody a great boost before the one day series
3382722 the promise to all men that god may take birth within their souls
3382723 whether you consider yourself a believer or a skeptic i invite you to seek the same kind of honesty and to grow in an understanding of the nature of your own doubts the result will exceed anything you can imagine
3382724 if you listen to u2 moby and johnny cashs hurt sometimes in church use sermon illustrations from the sopranos drink lattes in the afternoon and guinness in the evenings and always use a mac if your idea of quintessential christian discipleship is mother teresa martin luther king jr nelson mandela or desmond tutu if you dont like george w bush or institutions or big business or capitalism or left behind christianity if you love the bible as a beautiful inspiring collection of works that lead us into the mystery of god but is not inerrant if you search for truth but arent sure it can be found if youve ever been to a church with prayer labyrinths candles play doh chalk drawings couches or beanbags your youth group doesnt count if you loathe words like linear propositional rational machine and hierarchy and use words like ancient future jazz mosaic matrix missional vintage and dance then you might be an emergent christian
3382725 when you look at your children and you are overwhelmed with gratefulness for them who do you thank
3382726 steve ive thought about that a lot and while im still not a believer ive found myself offering prayers of thanksgiving even if it doesnt make sense

3383018 the point of difference between travelsupermarket com and travel agents both on and offline is we do not add on any fees or charges we simply display the price customers will pay if they click through and purchase a flight on one of our partners websites

3383050 the well being of older people in the downpatrick area has been uppermost in my mind in considering the future of st johns house
3383051 i have already seen the encouraging plans for a modern supported housing scheme on the site of the old appletree childrens home and i believe that this is where the future lies in terms of supporting older people to live safely independently and with dignity
3383052 the trusts proposals offer support in terms of domiciliary care day care and intermediate care to a far greater number of people in the downpatrick area to support them to live independently in their own homes for as long as possible and i welcome that
3383053 importantly their proposals also envisage supported living accommodation for 20 30 people who need that level of support i am confident that these proposals represent the best possible outcome for the people of downpatrick

3383059 this is the first election i ever actually looked at someone else other than the republican candidate
3383060 barack wants to focus on new technologies to cut foreign oil dependency and mccain wants offshore drilling
3383061 well why dont we do a hybrid of both candidates ideas
3383062 we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars
3383063 that way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in which will then create new jobs and energy independence energy crisis solved
3383064 the enthusiasm gap in this election season could not be clearer
3383065 it seems as if charlie crist is the only person in florida excited about john mccain and his promise of a third bush term floridians know that the bush mccain crist failed economic polices gave us the first recession in 16 years record job loss and home foreclosures
3383066 we expect a large turnout at the meeting because the members of the state executive committee understand it is their duty to approve the slate of electors so when barack obama wins florida there will be no question about our electors
3383067 with so many new democratic voters a record number of volunteers and great candidates running for offices across florida we are seeing a wave of support building to elect barack obama and democrats up and down the ticket
3383068 the florida democrat organization cant hold a candle to the our time tested strategy of recruiting volunteers and focusing on the people who are likely to vote and they certainly cant do it by focusing all their energy on young people and those who have never voted before in their lives
3383069 the democrats have beaten us in new registration before but what they dont do is turn those registered voters out at the polls at the end of the day the only thing that matters is who turns out and actually casts a vote
3383070 we have a volunteer system like no new campaign has seen in decades
3383071 you only need a certain amount of structure when youre operating within our campaign the volunteer system is so serious with our supporters were able to get operational in a very short amount of time
3383072 i just became a voter on jan 26 of this year so i really enjoy voting
3383073 i want to vote early here because i feel like voting is one of the basic fundamental rights that every american should use and exercise to determine who our representatives are
3383074 its a lot more convenient than the courthouse as far as parking and time and just driving

3383077 we as a womens group basically are out to support women candidates and find women candidates for office
3383078 its basically a chance to meet like minded women from all over the state and find out what theyre doing in their chapters and communities to get democrats elected and push for resolution to some of the issues facing us today
3383079 candidate debates are one of the cornerstones of our democratic system but so far during this campaign vern buchanan has tried to hide from any real debate on the issues and his record
3383080 we look very much forward to debating all of the candidates
3383081 its just part of a larger pattern of vern buchanan not giving voters any consideration
3383082 we welcome him at debates if he does decide to give the voters that consideration
3383083 it appears that hes made up his mind that hes not going to appear on any platform with chris jennings
3383084 for whatever reason he will not get on the platform with the other candidates for the 13th district race
3383085 we said that when the time comes to campaign we will consider a candidate forum but that the congressman was not yet in campaign mode
3383086 it would imply that tiger bay would be endorsing him just as i could not have chris jennings come by herself because that would imply tiger bay club was endorsing her thats the quandary im in

3383098 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3383099 i had great teachers in the public schools of montgomery county maryland in the 1950s and 1960s to these fine men and women it came naturally to praise america and to teach their students that love of their country was an integral part of mental health in those long forgotten days teachers believed it was their job to build moral character and that patriotism was a major part of that character and im grateful for it i dont have anywhere near the strength of character of many people around me but what little i do have is owed largely to my teachers

3383151 if you lose weight after diagnosis you can achieve some long term benefits in terms of blood pressure and glycemic control that extend even beyond the point at which you regain weight
3383152 we havent had results like this before this is telling us that with a significant mean weight loss of 10 7 kilograms 23 5 pounds in 18 months theres an improvement despite weight regain after 36 months
3383153 its entirely possible that one of the explanations here is that if we looked at 15 years we wouldnt find that benefit continuing
3383154 losing weight is a good idea even if you regain it

3383170 i never asked the party to kiss my ring or anything like that
3383171 it would have been appropriate if the party interviewed me before they nominated you
3383172 im not going to apologize because the party respects my record of service of 26 years
3383173 they know they need someone in washington who will stand firm will mean what they say and say what they mean
3383174 politics shouldnt be comfortable it needs to change faster than it changes today
3383175 i dont take away your 26 years but i think we need change
3383176 when development proposals come before you have the science developed you end up with development limiting options for restoration
3383177 the governor has not reviewed the specific details in the proposal by florida crystals
3383178 while there may be an opportunity for economic development efforts to work in partnership with everglades restoration the governors focus is in making sure that there are no barriers to the restoration efforts
3383179 what were trying to achieve here is really to create a balance between economic development our sugar operation and the environment
3383180 you have 1 700 people here who are waiting for some kind any kind of answer
3383181 its the most important thing i think i will ever do as the governor
3383182 why do you want to be on the supreme court
3383183 i think many of us have thought since we were young about being on the supreme court
3383184 one of the big problems with our branch of government is when the economy turns south our work picks up
3383185 foreclosures are up in multiples in florida at a time when we dont have the money to keep the courts open
3383186 its the most important thing i think i will ever do as the governor
3383187 why do you want to be on the supreme court
3383188 i think many of us have thought since we were young about being on the supreme court
3383189 one of the big problems with our branch of government is when the economy turns south our work picks up
3383190 foreclosures are up in multiples in florida at a time when we dont have the money to keep the courts open
3383191 when development proposals come before you have the science developed you end up with development limiting options for restoration
3383192 what were trying to achieve here is really to create a balance between economic development our sugar operation and the environment
3383193 you have 1 700 people here who are waiting for some kind any kind of answer
3383194 we just want to be treated with fairness and respect
3383195 id just like to ask them eyeball to eyeball and say im a cpa by profession so numbers mean a lot to me to show me what justifies a 47 percent increase
3383196 the key is support for the filing and for the rate thats being requested
3383197 unfortunately the credit crunch hit at the same time as portability
3383198 if we werent experiencing that portability would be really really impressing people it will work for us yet im utterly convinced of that
3383199 people are afraid to take on any greater financial responsibility right now
3383200 any way you cut it whether its one home or 1 000 homes were better off with portability
3383201 i bet i answer two dozen portability questions a day theyre thinking about it but they want to know how much further do i think home prices will drop and when will it end
3383202 he was responsible exercised restraint and yet was decisive he taught me that
3383203 i was always taught to do your job and keep your mouth shut
3383204 she tipped me a dime every time i pumped her gas
3383205 i never thought i would stay in washington this long ever
3383206 theyre really looking for someone with a law enforcement background
3383207 i thought i could overcome that but it came up in every interview with the governors and the cabinets aides
3383208 apparently i dont have the votes of the governor and cabinet
3383209 that was the feedback i got late this afternoon from the cabinet aides
3383210 i feel like nancy pelosi as the democratic leader has failed our country miserably funding for more war
3383211 the speakers failed to hold george bush and dick cheney accountable
3383212 the speaker has the highest respect for cindy sheehan ms sheehan lost her son in the iraq war and has the right as every american has to run for office
3383213 i am as confident as ever about the future of the space coast the entrepreneurial spirit is part of our dna
3383214 they woke up this weekend and figured out that that ad resonated and they needed to do something about it
3383215 if the celebrity issue were not hurting them they would have ignored it

3383255 my company has been shut down three times because we were installing sidewalks without a locate
3383256 ive called thousands of times for locates theyll bust me for driving a stake into the ground 6 inches but they let these politicians go around and dig 2 and 3 foot post holes and put their signs in
3383257 the ones i see typically are in the areas where the utilities are
3383258 to lower energy prices that are crippling small businesses tourism and central florida families
3383259 i have heard loud and clear that central floridians want a comprehensive energy plan that lowers energy prices today and maps out a plan for americas future
3383260 whenever liberals decide they are willing to vote on a plan for american energy i will be there
3383261 everywhere i went people pretty much said the same thing im glad to see you tom
3383262 republicans are clearly frustrated that the american public is not buying their johnny one note energy policies of the past
3383263 we had oil rigs galore decimated by hurricanes for three years running in the gulf of mexico and not one spill the safety factors have increased so much since 1969

3383269 its such a hyper technical statute he chalifoux made an assumption that others made before
3383270 im going to protect my name i didnt do anything wrong
3383271 shipped our jobs overseas wrongly started the war in iraq and destroyed our economy
3383272 that mailer is an outright lie to mislead the voters
3383273 i dont think that district wants a convicted felon speaking for them anymore
3383274 everyone was saying that this team is not even going to make it to the second day we read all that yeah we did
3383275 we sat up in the computer lab and said we cant believe theyre writing this stuff we always knew at the least that we would be a team that would be in position to be looking at a medals podium
3383276 we talked every night we never stopped believing in ourselves
3383277 as far as im concerned this is gold for us
3383278 i said you guys this meet has been great regardless of what happens
3383279 i told them that i loved them no matter what happens

3383290 coaching education and training is even more critical with younger athletes
3383291 sounded a bit thin with no distortion but then again who am i to talk as johnny marr once recalled how many guitarists do you need to screw a light bulb one to do it and the rest to stand around saying how they would have done it better

3383294 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3383295 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3383296 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3383297 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3383298 over the years the endangered species act has become a regulatory nightmare that kills or stalls even the most well crafted land use projects

3383323 they can no longer remain they brought shame upon themselves as peacekeepers they committed crimes

3383352 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3383353 above all this irony emerges clinton ran on the basis of managerial competence on her capacity as she liked to put it to do the job from day one in fact she never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel
3383354 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited

3383418 privately dismissed the notion that sir alex ferguson has turned his sights to thierry henry
3383419 in no mood to let him leave having sold ronaldinho
3383420 that leaves united with a deal to do over berbatov before the end of the month with ferguson admitting there was an issue with scoring goals after the community shield game against portsmouth had to be settled on penalties following a goalless draw
3383421 we are a wee bit slow out of the start but once we find our style we can put a bit of a move on
3383422 i know we made a few people in the stands a bit nervous because ive got a few texts saying we were jittery but we werent worried
3383423 we dont place too much emphasis on the times because the races can be so different
3383424 it is more the pattern of the splits that we will look at well look at the two times but the important thing is we are in the final
3383425 weve got one more race now which we want to race our best in and i feel we are peaking at the right time
3383426 you could definitely say its one of the worst feelings
3383427 its the olympics and im with the team in the village
3383428 theyre not going to give me a tough time because i lost but its nice to make others proud and to win for new zealand
3383429 when you dont its tough but thats how it goes
3383430 it did go through my mind but it wasnt something i dwelt on
3383431 but i was thinking at one stage i had match point this could have been done but it didnt happen
3383432 any loss in the olympics is tough you want to do well in the olympics
3383433 but that might have been the problem maybe she wanted to do well too badly it seemed to me morita wasnt expecting anything and was quite loose
3383434 marina was muscling the ball too much and was not really relaxed
3383435 if its a form slump you lose one and one she hasnt done that what i think is maybe shes creating too much expectation for herself and putting a little too much pressure on herself
3383436 i think that the bucharest communique stands the allies have said in bucharest that one day georgia will join nato
3383437 nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict
3383438 it is very important that all parties go back to the status quo ante that is as it existed on august 6
3383439 none of the ministers are able to leave the capital right now
3383440 nat rlich rgere ich mich ber diesen fehler aber wenn er nicht passiert w re h tte es auch nicht mit bronze geklappt und wenn es dann so knapp ist w ren wir auch nicht gl cklicher gewesen

3383443 it kind of goes without saying this is a pretty big day for us
3383444 there are four beautiful little daughters all eating cake playing with each other and its very surreal its hard to believe this is the life i somehow wandered into
3383445 the university of calgary faculty of environmental design donated a table they made especially designed to feed the four babies each of the girls has their own spot and theyre actually finger feeding themselves now
3383446 we started with toenail polish and then we got brave and we let that wear off
3383447 its always been colours autumn was autumn colours red yellow brown orange brooke is water colours so blue or green and calissa is pink and dahlia is purple
3383448 autumn is just a smiley happy little girl brooke is the most laid back calissa is absolutely the busiest of the girls if theres trouble shes causing it or on her way to it dahlia is very independent
3383449 we dont want to raise our kids as a collective quad
3383450 simon is amazing in himself he is so sweet and gentle hes their favourite person definitely their favourite person
3383451 i do remember very clearly when they pulled out autumn and youre so worried and you dont know whats going to happen and they pulled her out and she let out this great big cry and i just remember thinking shes going to be ok shes crying shes crying
3383452 and then brooke calissa and dahlia and then i was out and i was always worried they were going to pull out a fifth
3383453 jj has been a valued member of the bears family both on and off the field the past two years and we thank him for his key contributions in helping us win the 2007 atlantic league championship while at the same time wishing him much happiness and success in his next career path
3383454 we are working toward an agreed framework five or six points the more difficult points are settled what is important is that areas of convergence are increasing but areas of divergence remain tawang in arunachal pradesh state remains the most important
3383455 till that the issue of tawang is settled whatever else we may do it is difficult to say we have crossed the rubicon
3383456 when they the chinese talk in terms of movement forward they keep arguing tawang has always been a part of tibet which is a matter of debate
3383457 tawang is an area with substantial settled populations not a small number it flies in the face of guiding principles and political parameters for china to demand it how we work out whether i have the ingenuity or mr dai bingguo the chinese special representative has the flexibility we will see
3383458 they the talks have not gone cold far from it last six months they put everything on hold next month we will be holding the talks it is my turn to go across to china
3383459 we were supposed to meet earlier this year but my counterpart dai bingguo was getting upgraded
3383460 so there was doubt whether he would be the interlocutor by the time that got settled they got into the olympic mode we have been in touch we are very comfortable quite happy with the progress we have made
3383461 chinese have been a little more assertive in all the areas that are treated as disputed
3383462 they have been careful not to intrude into any area which is either not disturbed or which by their very careful assessment does not fall within what they regard as their area
3383463 but we dont realise why they should increase the frequency of their visits to the areas
3383464 we have not been able to fathom this but once again i would take the views of the political leadership
3383465 yes there will be instances of this kind we havent settled the border its not demarcated or delineated there will always be a certain amount of discomfort we are careful
3383466 we dont wish to do something which would aggravate the situation from either side
3383467 we are conscious of it the instructions are that you cannot be complacent because you have to guard our border from our side there will be no provocative action

3383470 there was no evidence to support the prosecution case and there is not any i feel ashamed for the belarusian judiciary
3383471 because first of all he has threatened not only mr zeltser but myself as well that he was going to destroy us unless we helped him to get 50 percent of this supposed wealth mr patarkatsishvili had
3383472 an absolute world class swindler who deceived thousands of people in the united states and not only in the united states it is a known fact
3383473 over 100 tablets containing drugs and psychotropic substances were seized from zeltser
3383474 the ongoing parliamentary election campaign in belarus is a time of increased risk for foreigners who come to visit our country because you come with your own goals but then become hostage to some political situation

3383478 we were really concerned they were missing out on some quality learning time especially since the first two hours are the literacy block
3383479 theres now some reluctance to be seen as a latecomer arriving late is an interruption to the class and there is an element of courtesy we encourage
3383480 the first day we launched it i was there and we were watching parents running to the classes so they didnt have to scan their kids in
3383481 many schools would have systems of their own where they track children coming in and out
3383482 but if st christophers has come up with a novel and innovative idea and it is taken in the sense of the good that it does and the children arent treated as objects coming into a supermarket checkout it sounds like a wonderful program
3383483 out of the millions of books in the largest library in the country in 1977 the first successful blind student at the university of tokyo couldnt read a single one this fact inspired me to develop library and information services for blind students on campus thirty years ago my goal became the development of equitable information services for blind people and other disadvantaged people who were excluded from written human knowledge

3383485 development policies have paid too little attention to how gender roles affect agricultural productivity and rural economic growth
3383486 without a specific focus on gender the policies and programs on technology and market access and for rural services are prone to reinforce and even exacerbate social and economic inequalities between women and men
3383487 this conference will help identify strategies to improve womens access to markets and business development services as well as ways to connect women to emerging opportunities through agricultural diversification
3383488 despite south asias strong economic record it has some of the highest levels of undernutrition in the world
3383489 a key reason for this is the weak status of women in the region
3383490 if south asian women involved in agriculture are to succeed future efforts must focus on increasing their empowerment and their control of critical resources

3383492 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3383493 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3383494 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3383495 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3383496 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
3383497 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
3383498 a listing of credits on april 28 1960 with a theater review of west side story on its return to the winter garden theater misstated the surname of the actor who played action
3383499 we can do that we can have a vote on that
3383500 but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and is not just a hoax on them
3383501 you cant account for everyones stupid actions but when things do happen if you respond to it and take the appropriate action thats reassuring
3383502 thats just its wrong its a place where families come to eat and them taking a bath in the sink thats just not work ethic
3383503 its entertainment thats set up by people who are high minded enough to not be racist or offensive
3383504 the whole film is based on the idea that what we actors do at some level is offensive and who we are at some level is despicable and pathetic which is the truth and not the truth but the part of it that is the truth is entertaining
3383505 it came to me that this woman loves and worships the same god i do
3383506 i had this sharpened awareness that in that moment she was in touch with god just as i was it was a dawning and an awakening and it was liberating because it liberates you from standing on a pedestal and looking down on someone else
3383507 is that we can find a way to bridge the chasm between christians muslims jews hindus and buddhists and make atlanta a model city that over the next year or two we can develop an interfaith immersion program
3383508 a soft evangelical i ask questions and listen rather than telling people what they ought to do or believe
3383509 im the most unlikely candidate for becoming a spokesperson about islam
3383510 i wondered who i was now that i wasnt a teacher preacher traveler or speaker
3383511 you get beneath the dogma and creeds to the essence of what religion is about its about god in human beings in human consciousness
3383512 a voice in my head said and you dont know anything about islam which was true i have five degrees four of them theological and other religions had never been taught seriously to me
3383513 everything about my faith is rooted in the stories my two grandmothers told me
3383514 no one formally taught me to pray as a child i had the question what is god like my grandmother answered that is like a drop in the ocean trying to understand what the ocean is like this is something i feel with my heart god is present in everything god is all around us
3383515 there were a couple of imams muslim clerics and im thinking they know all this stuff and im stumbling around in it
3383516 we had a pastor and an imam describe how they came to the faith that gives their lives meaning
3383517 and we asked people to talk at their tables about how their faith came to them
3383518 i dont think just knowledge about another faith is any good
3383519 youve gotta meet someone who is of the faith who is speaking out of conviction and out of experience to really feel what islam is like
3383520 puts muslims at ease because hes mastered the broad historical perspective of islam but also some of the nuanced details
3383521 people are more open to learning a new perspective from someone they respect ben is not trying to convert anyone but to inform people and build understanding
3383522 when i heard him talk about islam i thought we need him
3383523 many christians are fearful of islam so they put up barriers they trust ben so they are willing to take the first step and listen for understanding
3383524 if you sit in silence you can get deep enough into your faith that it touches another person
3383525 the reality is that at the core were all the same
3383526 first we make our habits then our habits make us
3383527 there comes to you the blessed month of ramadan a month in which allah has made fasting obligatory on those who are able whosoever denies himself of the benefits of that month denies himself many virtues
3383528 your practice of faith will not be correct unless your actions are correct and your actions will not be considered correct unless your heart is correct
3383529 there were areas in the inner cities where violence has forced individuals within a 30 square feet radius to remain there for years they cannot go up the lane down the lane or anywhere else because of violence the end result is this heart breaking situation
3383530 the males have never left it their communities to find a girl
3383531 there are cases where mothers have turned to their sons because their husbands or spouses are in prison and they go to her sons to fulfil her sexual needs
3383532 i am aware of it we have never had a case to deal with it at fathers inc but there are at least four communities where there are just too many instances of this happening
3383533 i have come across situations where during the investigation of a crime you find everybody with the same surname in one instance i interviewed 30 persons and they all have the same surnames
3383534 they were brothers sisters cousins and friends it got to a point where you say wait a minute what is happening here only to retrace your steps to find that they are all family in the sickest kind of ways
3383535 they are the product of the same lineage and this cannot be good for any country and any community can you just imagine the maladjustments of this generation of young people
3383536 this is well known we know this already i work in an inner city community and this is something i know very well
3383537 while supporters like you are out knocking on doors registering new voters and organizing in your local communities our opponents are not even trying to match your efforts instead theyre spending millions to spread the smear that barack is just a celebrity and that our grassroots movement is just a bunch of mindless fans
3383538 two million donors is an incredible number a number that was previously unimaginable for presidential campaigns
3383539 and its a number this campaign never dreamed we could reach before the convention
3383540 somebody made that decision to not feed that child and my daughter had to follow instructions
3383541 in short goldman is no longer as much in the right place at the right time at least compared to the past year
3383542 key drivers of revenue such as investment banking and mergers and acquisition have simply not been happening enough to stimulate related businesses
3383543 as goldmans revenues are relatively the most equity linked of its broker peers the fact that broad global equity market indices are all down double digits will have a meaningful effect on the companys earnings

3383546 an integration of matter and concomitant dissipation of motion during which the matter passes from an indefinite incoherent homogeneity to a definite coherent heterogeneity
3383547 was not a specialist in biology and his speculations on biological problems have not advanced that science to any very great extent
3383548 he became one of the most influential promoters of the new doctrine of evolution
3383549 only alternative to the hypothesis of evolution is the hypothesis of special creation
3383550 the belief that each species of organism was specially created
3383551 arisen by insensible steps through actions such as we see habitually going on
3383552 a s if there were nothing in heaven and earth except an omnipotent deity acting as his own agent or natural selection of chance variations
3383553 in order to improve the appearance of his own case
3383554 the progressionist implication was retained in a rather different form by the philosopher herbert spencer the person who did most to popularize the term evolution in its modern context spencer advocated a system of cosmic progress which included a theory of the inevitable evolution of life toward higher forms darwins theory came to be tagged evolution even though he seldom used the term himself and most people still imagine that evolution is an essentially progressive process
3383555 spencers belief in the universality of natural causation was together with his laissez faire political creed the bedrock of his thinking it was this belief more than anything else that led him to reject christianity long before the great conflict of the eighteen sixties moreover it was his belief in natural causation that led him to embrace the theory of evolution not vice versa his faith was so strong that it did not wait on scientific proof spencer became an ardent evolutionist at a time when a cautious scientist would have been justified at least in suspending judgement for him the belief in natural causation was primary the theory of evolution derivative
3383556 it is easy enough to set up a straw man to point to the whales vestigial pelvic bones for example and to say that if god had created the whale directly and from nothing he wouldnt have included these useless parts typically neo darwinists then argue that it simply does not make sense to attribute the whale to divine creation as if there were nothing in heaven and earth except an omnipotent deity acting as his own agent or natural selection of chance variations
3383557 darwins contrast of the explanatory powers of his theory with the creationist especially in the areas of geographical distribution morphology embryology and rudimentary organs represents i think the strongest line of arguments in the origin yet even here where darwins arguments are strongest nagging questions remain for example a reader of the origin might be justified in wondering what creationist view darwin is referring to perhaps this is a problem more for the present day reader darwins contemporaries may have known exactly what he meant though i doubt it often the creationist position seems merely a straw man set up only to be knocked down the constraints on space in the origin which led darwin to abandon his original intention of arguing on both sides of the mutability issue add to this feeling the result is that the creationist position is never clearly defined in the origin
3383558 evolution without evidence charles darwin and the origin of species
3383559 charles darwins hostile preoccupation with the belief that god had separately and individually created each of the animal and plant species in the world is one of the most intriguing but neglected features of the origin of species historians have disagreed about what to make of it some have accused darwin of setting up a straw man in order to improve the appearance of his own case lastly there are those who believe correctly i think that darwins rejection of special creation was part of the transformation of biology into a positive science one committed to thoroughly naturalistic explanations based on material causes and the uniformity of the laws of nature a change to which the origin was a signally important contribution consequently it was not a harmless straw man but a traditional bias found among scientists and laymen alike and one that stood in the path of any novel way of viewing the problem of species darwin then was not engaged in anachronistic shadowboxing but had selected his target well and knew exactly what he was doing his attack on special creation was a response to the crisis and an attempt to resolve it by helping to promote the restructuring of biology along positivist lines the critique of special creation in the origin was systematically organized to that end there were then in 1859 a minority of naturalists some of them influential who believed in miraculous creation others of shifting number who believed in direct divine intervention in some mysterious but lawful manner to create each new species a third group a small minority who had accepted the descent theory a fourth larger group who were moving away from a belief in direct divine intervention in favor of a natural cause but who were either skeptical of its being found or who were engaged in a quest for laws rather than true causes and lastly a group that busied itself with practical work and renounced theory altogether all of these save the third combined willy nilly to create a genuine obstacle in the path of the project charles darwin had undertaken
3383560 evolution entered the english language as a synonym for descent with modification through the propaganda of herbert spencer that indefatigable victorian pundit of nearly everything evolution to spencer was the overarching law of all development and to a smug victorian what principle other than progress could rule the developmental processes of the universe thus spencer defined the universal law in his first principles of 1862 evolution is an integration of matter and concomitant dissipation of motion during which the matter passes from an indefinite incoherent homogeneity to a definite coherent heterogeneity two other aspects of spencers work contributed to the establishment of evolution in its present meaning first in writing his very popular principles of biology 1864 67 spencer constantly used evolution as a description of organic change second he did not view progress as an intrinsic capacity of matter but as a result of cooperation between internal and external environmental forces this view fit nicely with most nineteenth century concepts of organic evolution for victorian scientists easily equated organic change with organic progress thus evolution was available when many scientists felt a need for a term more succinct than darwins descent with modification
3383561 the straw man fallacy is the tactic in argument of misrepresenting an opponents position making it appear more implausible so that it can more easily be refuted then going ahead and arguing against the imputed position as though it were really that of your opponent
3383562 spencers idea of evolution herbert spencer was not a specialist in biology and his speculations on biological problems have not advanced that science to any very great extent he nevertheless deserves a place in the history of biology as a rare example of a consummate and typical representative of that evolutional mode of thought which was awakened to life by the general tendency of the times in the middle of last century and which was promoted by darwinism he is commonly called the most consistent philosopher of evolution which that period produced evolution forms the very groundwork of his system in its essential features this system was already pretty definite before the advent of darwin it was promulgated in a number of small articles in periodicals often characterized by masterly penetration and lucidity afterwards brought together to form an imposing work entitled a system of synthetic philosophy which was the fruits of thirty years work and which gives a broad often too broad development of what is recorded in the short treatises hoffding when darwin produced his theory spencer associated himself with it although he interprets it after his own mind and he became one of the most influential promoters of the new doctrine of evolution otherwise he is said not to have been in favour of extensive studies he preferred to think for himself and was very jealous of his independence
3383563 in his autobiography herbert spencer recounts in excruciating detail the process by which he developed a naturalistic outlook beginning when he was a boy over time he writes a breach in the course of physical causation had come to be if not an impossible thought yet a thought never entertained spencer 1904 1 172 as in darwins case members of spencers family described his adherence to naturalism in near religious terms his father drew a parallel between the sons naturalism and the fathers own religion from what i see of my sons mind it appears to me that the laws of nature are to him what revealed religion is to us and that any wilful infraction of those laws is to him as much a sin as to us is disbelief in what is revealed spencer 1904 1 655 this semireligious attachment to naturalism explains why spencer eventually became a tireless promoter of darwinism it was not because he was persuaded by darwins scientific theory he rejected darwinism and embraced lamarckianism yet spencer saw clearly that once he had embraced philosophical naturalism he had no alternative but to accept some form of naturalistic evolution as he puts it having discarded orthodox christianity he developed an intellectual leaning towards belief in natural causation everywhere operating and in that naturalistic leaning doubtless a belief in evolution at large was then latent why latent because anyone who abandoning the supernaturalism of theology accepts in full the naturalism of science tacitly asserts that all things as they now exist have been evolved spencer accepted naturalism first and then accepted evolution as a logical consequence he goes on the doctrine of the universality of natural causation has for its inevitable corollary the doctrine that the universe and all things in it have reached their present forms through successive stages physically necessitated spencer 1904 2 7 just so once one accepts the philosophy of naturalism some form of naturalistic evolution is an inevitable corollary finding a plausible scientific theory is secondary in spencers writings we get a glimpse of the intellectual pressure that impelled him toward a naturalistic view of evolution i cheerfully acknowledge he writes in the principles of psychology that the hypothesis of evolution is beset by serious difficulties scientifically yet save for those who still adhere to the hebrew myth or to the doctrine of special creations derived from it there is no alternative but this hypothesis or no hypothesis and no one can long remain in the neutral state of having no hypothesis spencer 1896 1 466n similarly in an 1899 letter he writes that already decades earlier in 1852 the belief in organic evolution had taken deep root not for scientific reasons but because of the necessity of accepting the hypothesis of evolution when the hypothesis of special creation has been rejected he concludes with these telling words the special creation belief had dropped out of my mind many years before and i could not remain in a suspended state acceptance of the only conceivable alternative was peremptory duncan 1908 2 319 here is a candid admission that spencer was driven by a sense of philosophical necessity naturalistic evolution was the only conceivable alternative to creation more than by a dispassionate assessment of the scientific evidence
3383564 an argument proposes a false dilemma when it presumes that only two alternatives exist when in actuality there are more than two for example either science can explain how she was cured or it was a miracle science cant explain how she was cured so it must be a miracle these two alternatives do not exhaust all the possibilities its possible for example that she was cured by some natural cause that scientists dont yet understand because the argument doesnt take this possibility into account its fallacious again either have your horoscope charted by an astrologer or continue to stumble through life without knowing where youre going you certainly dont want to continue your wayward ways so you should have your horoscope charted by an astrologer if someone is concerned about the direction his or her life is taking there are other things he or she can do about it than consult an astrologer since there are other options the argument is fallacious
3383565 how to think about weird things critical thinking for a new age
3383566 we have to choose between two hypotheses the hypothesis of special creation and the hypothesis of evolution either the multitudinous kinds of organisms which now exist and the far more multitudinous kinds which have existed during past geologic eras have been from time to time separately made or they have arisen by insensible steps through actions such as we see habitually going on both hypotheses imply a cause the last certainly as much as the first recognizes this cause as inscrutable the point at issue is how this inscrutable cause has worked in the production of living forms this point if it is to be decided at all is to be decided only by examination of evidence let us inquire which of these antagonist hypotheses is most congruous with established facts
3383567 if then of this once numerous family of beliefs the immense majority have become extinct we may not unreasonably expect that the few remaining members of the family will become extinct one of these is the belief we are here considering the belief that each species of organism was specially created many who in all else have abandoned the aboriginal theory of things still hold this remnant of the aboriginal theory ask any well informed man whether he accepts the cosmogony of the indians or the greeks or the hebrews and he will regard the question as next to an insult yet one element common to these cosmogonies he very likely retains not bearing in mind its origin for whence did he get the doctrine of special creations catechise him and he is forced to confess that it was put into his mind in childhood as one portion of a story which as a whole he has long since rejected why this fragment is likely to be right while all the rest is wrong he is unable to say may we not then expect that the relinquishment of all other parts of this story will by and by be followed by the relinquishment of this remaining part of it
3383568 the belief which we find thus questionable both as being a primitive belief and as being a belief belonging to an almost extinct family is a belief not countenanced by a single fact no one ever saw a special creation no one ever found proof of an indirect kind that a special creation had taken place it is significant as dr hooker remarks that naturalists who suppose new species to be miraculously originated habitually suppose the origination to occur in some region remote from human observation wherever the order of organic nature is exposed to the view of zoologists and botanists it expels this conception and the conception survives only in connexion with imagined places where the order of organic nature is unknown
3383569 besides being absolutely without evidence to give it external support this hypothesis of special creations cannot support itself internally cannot be framed into a coherent thought it is one of those illegitimate symbolic conceptions which are mistaken for legitimate symbolic conceptions first principles 9 because they remain untested immediately an attempt is made to elaborate the idea into anything like a definite shape it proves to be a pseud idea admitting of no definite shape is it supposed that a new organism when specially created is created out of nothing if so there is a supposed creation of matter and the creation of matter is inconceivable implies the establishment of a relation in thought between nothing and something a relation of which one term is absent an impossible relation is it supposed that the matter of which the new organism consists is not created for the occasion but is taken out of its pre existing forms and arranged into a new form if so we are met by the question how is the re arrangement effected of the myriad atoms going to the composition of the new organism all of them previously dispersed through the neighbouring air and earth does each suddenly disengaging itself from its combinations rush to meet the rest unite with them into the appropriate chemical compounds and then fall with certain others into its appointed place in the aggregate of complex tissues and organs surely thus to assume a myriad supernatural impulses differing in their directions and amounts given to as many different atoms is a multiplication of mysteries rather than the solution of a mystery for every one of these impulses not being the result of a force locally existing in some other form implies the creation of force and the creation of force is just as inconceivable as the creation of matter it is thus with all attempted ways of representing the process
3383570 the belief in special creations of organisms arose among men during the era of profoundest darkness and it belongs to a family of beliefs which have nearly all died out as enlightenment has increased it is without a solitary established fact on which to stand and when the attempt is made to put it into definite shape in the mind it turns out to be only a pseud idea this mere verbal hypothesis which men idly accept as a real or thinkable hypothesis is of the same nature as would be one based on a days observation of human life that each man and woman was specially created an hypothesis not suggested by evidence but by lack of evidence an hypothesis which formulates ignorance into a semblance of knowledge further we see that this hypothesis failing to satisfy mens intellectual need of an interpretation fails also to satisfy their moral sentiment it is quite inconsistent with those conceptions of the divine nature which they profess to entertain if infinite power was to be demonstrated then either by the special creation of every individual or by the production of species by some method of natural genesis it would be better demonstrated than by the use of two methods as assumed by the hypothesis and if infinite goodness was to be demonstrated then not only do the provisions of organic structure if they are specially devised fail to demonstrate it but there is an enormous mass of them which imply malevolence rather than benevolence thus the hypothesis of special creations turns out to be worthless by its derivation worthless in its intrinsic incoherence worthless as absolutely without evidence worthless as not supplying an intellectual need worthless as not satisfying a moral want we must therefore consider it as counting for nothing in opposition to any other hypothesis respecting the origin of organic beings
3383571 a kindred antithesis exists between the two families of beliefs to which the beliefs we are comparing severally belong while the one family has been dying out the other family has been multiplying as fast as men have ceased to regard different classes of phenomena as caused by special personal agents acting irregularly so fast have they come to regard these different classes of phenomena as caused by a general agency acting uniformly the two changes being correlatives and as on the one hand the hypothesis that each species resulted from a supernatural act having lost nearly all its kindred hypotheses may be expected soon to die so on the other hand the hypothesis that each species resulted from the action of natural causes being one of an increasing family of hypotheses may be expected to survive
3383572 the hypothesis of evolution is contrasted with the hypothesis of special creations in a further respect it is not simply legitimate instead of illegitimate because representable in thought instead of unrepresentable but it has the support of some evidence instead of being absolutely unsupported by evidence though the facts at present assignable in direct proof that by progressive modifications races of organisms which are apparently distinct from antecedent races have descended from them are not sufficient yet there are numerous facts of the order required beyond all question unlikenesses of structure gradually arise among the members of successive generations we find that there is going on a modifying process of the kind alleged as the source of specific differences a process which though slow does in time produce conspicuous changes a process which to all appearance would produce in millions of years any amount of change
3383573 in all respects then the hypothesis of evolution contrasts favourably with the hypothesis of special creation it has arisen in comparatively instructed times and in the most cultivated class it is one of those beliefs in the uniform concurrence of phenomena which are gradually supplanting beliefs in their irregular and arbitrary concurrence and it belongs to a genus of these beliefs which has of late been rapidly spreading it is a definitely conceivable hypothesis being simply an extension to the organic world at large of a conception framed from our experiences of individual organisms just as the hypothesis of universal gravitation was an extension of the conception which our experiences of terrestrial gravitation had produced this definitely conceivable hypothesis besides the support of numerous analogies has the support of direct evidence we have proof that there is going on a process of the kind alleged and though the results of this process as actually witnessed are minute in comparison with the totality of results ascribed to it yet they bear to such totality a ratio as great as that by which an analogous hypothesis is justified lastly that sentiment which the doctrine of special creations is thought necessary to satisfy is much better satisfied by the doctrine of evolution since this doctrine raises no contradictory implications respecting the unknown cause such as are raised by the antagonist doctrine
3383574 von baer lived in the days when the development hypothesis was mentioned only to be ridiculed and he joined in the ridicule what he conceived to be the meaning of these groupings of organisms and these relations among their embryological histories is not obvious the only alternative to the hypothesis of evolution is the hypothesis of special creation and as he did not accept the one it is inferable that he accepted the other but if he did this he must in the first place have found no answer to the inquiry why organisms specially created should have the embryological kinships he described and in the second place after discovering that his alleged law was traversed by many and various nonconformities he would have been without any explanation of these
3383575 on considering the general aspects of the special creation hypothesis we discovered it to be worthless discredited by its origin and wholly without any basis of observed fact we found that it was not even a thinkable hypothesis and while thus intellectually illusive it turned out to have moral implications irreconcilable with the professed beliefs of those who hold it contrariwise the general aspects of the evolution hypothesis begot the stronger faith in it the more nearly they were considered by its lineage and its kindred it was found to be as closely allied with the proved truths of modern science as is the antagonist hypothesis with the proved errors of ancient ignorance we saw that instead of being a mere pseud idea it admits of elaboration into a definite conception so showing its legitimacy as an hypothesis instead of positing a purely fictitious process the process which it alleges proves to be one actually going on around us to which add that morally considered this hypothesis presents no radical incongruities thus even were we without further means of judging there could be no rational hesitation which of the two views should be entertained
3383576 our formula therefore needs an additional clause to combine this satisfactorily with the clauses as they stand in the last chapter is scarcely practicable and for convenience of expression it will be best to change their order doing this and making the requisite addition the formula finally stands thus evolution is an integration of matter and concomitant dissipation of motion during which the matter passes from an indefinite incoherent homogeneity to a definite coherent heterogeneit y and during which the retained motion undergoes a parallel transformation

3383595 we are grateful that the cbbf subjected julie coram to a prompt fair and reliable drug test
3383596 the results were not at all surprising to us she tested absolutely clean she had no traces whatsoever of any banned substances in her sample julie has been exonerated
3383597 inferior drug testing protocols can yield inaccurate results however the reliability of the cces drug testing protocol is in line with the world anti doping agency which is considered the gold standard for drug testing
3383598 hopefully julies cces results may encourage fame to re examine its anti doping protocols and bring them up to the standards of other organizations so that true dopers can be caught and rightfully punished but innocent athletes are not ensnared

3383730 the book of pierre p grasse is a frontal attack on all kinds of darwinism its purpose is to destroy the myth of evolution as a simple understood and explained phenomenon and to show that evolution is a mystery about which little is and perhaps can be known now one can disagree with grasse but not ignore him he is the most distinguished of french zoologists the editor of the 28 volumes of traite de zoologie author of numerous original investigations and ex president of the academie des sciences his knowledge of the living world is encyclopedic and his book is replete with interesting facts that any biologist would profit by knowing
3383731 professor pierre grass who for thirty years held the chair for evolution at the sorbonne
3383732 more recently another book critical of darwins theory was published in france by dr pierre p grass the book
3383733 dr grass poses the question this way how does the darwinian mutational interpretation of evolution account for the fact that the
3383734 according to grass mutations are merely hereditary fluctuations around a medium position a swing to the right a swing to the left but no final evolutionary effect they modify what pre exists grass 1977 p 87 whereas darwin thought that variations led to new species the evidence proves the contrary namely that variation improves the ability of the species to maintain itself against radical change
3383735 the problem says grass is that some contemporary biologists as soon as they observe a mutation talk about evolution this conclusion says grass does not agree with the facts
3383736 to hammer his point home grass feels compelled to use the computer as an appropriate reference point the computer is limited in its operations by the program controlling it and the units of information fed into it to enlarge its possibilities its contents have to be enriched
3383737 to be programmed and fed with external information in order for novelties to emerge
3383738 the systematically similar structures of fossilized organisms and their modern day counterparts if not extinct are described by grass biologists find it hard to admit that in their basic structure
3383739 synthetically reproduced protolife and artificial evolution in computers have already unearthed a growing body of nontrivial surprises yet artificial life suffers from the same malaise that afflicts its cousin artificial intelligence no artificial intelligence that i am aware of be it autonomous robot learning machine or massive cognition program has run more than 24 hours in succession after a day artificial intelligence stalls likewise artificial life most runs of computational life fizzle out of novelty quickly while the programs sometimes keep running churning out minor variation they ascend to no new levels of complexity or surprise after the first spurt computational life based on unadorned natural selection has not seen the miracle of open ended evolution that its creators and i would love to see as the french evolutionist pierre grasse said variation is one thing evolution quite another this cannot be emphasized strongly enough mutations provide change but not progress grass 1977 pp 6 218 so while natural selection may be responsible for microchange a trend in variations no one can say indisputably that it is responsible for macrochange the open ended creation of an unexpected novel form and progress toward increasing complexity
3383740 what artificial selection actually shows is that there are definite limits to the amount of variation that even the most highly skilled breeders can achieve breeding of domestic animals has produced no new species in the commonly accepted sense of new breeding communities that are infertile when crossed with the parent group the eminent french zoologist pierre grass concluded that the results of artificial selection provide powerful testimony against darwins theory in spite of the intense pressure generated by artificial selection eliminating any parent not answering the criteria of choice over whole millennia no new species are born a comparative study of sera hemoglobins blood proteins interfertility etc proves that the strains remain within the same specific definition this is not a matter of opinion or subjective classification but a measurable reality the fact is that s election gives tangible form to and gathers together all the varieties a genome is capable of producing but does not constitute an innovative evolutionary process grass 1977 pp 124 25 in other words the reason that dogs dont become as big a elephants much less change into elephants is not that we just havent been breeding them long enough dogs do not have the genetic capacity for that degree of change and they stop getting bigger when the genetic limit is reached
3383741 the time available unquestionably has to be taken into account in evaluating the results of breeding experiments but it is also possible that the greater time available to nature may be more than counterbalanced by the power of intelligent purpose which is brought to bear in artificial selection
3383742 none of the proofs provides any persuasive reason for believing that natural selection can produce new species new organs or other major changes or even minor changes that are permanent the sickle cell anemia case for example merely shows that in special circumstances an apparently disadvantageous trait may not be eliminated from the population that larger birds have an advantage over smaller birds in high winds or droughts has no tendency whatever to prove that similar factors caused birds to come into existence in the first place very likely smaller birds have the advantage in other circumstances which explains why birds are not continually becoming larger pierre grass was as unimpressed by this kind of evidence as i am and he summarized his conclusions at the end of his chapter on evolution and natural selection the evolution in action of j huxley end other biologists is simply the observation of demographic facts local fluctuations of genotypes geographical distributions often the species concerned have remained practically unchanged for hundreds of centuries fluctuation as a result of circumstances with prior modification of the genome does not imply evolution and we have tangible proof of this in many panchronic species i e living fossils that remain unchanged for millions of years grass 1977 p130
3383743 grass denied emphatically that mutation and selection have the power to create new complex organs or body plans explaining that the intra species variation that results from dna copying errors is mere fluctuation which never leads to any important innovation dobzhanskys famous work with fruitflies was a case in point according to grass the genic differences noted between separate populations of the same species that are so often presented as evidence of ongoing evolution are above all a case of the adjustment of a population to its habitat and of the effects of genetic drift the fruitfly drosophila melanogaster the favorite pet insect of the geneticists whose geographical biotropical urban and rural genotypes are now known inside out seems not to have changed since the remotest times grass 1977 p 130
3383744 grass insisted that the defining quality of life is the intelligence encoded in its biochemical systems an intelligence that cannot be understood solely in terms of its material embodiment the minerals that form a great cathedral do not differ essentially from the same materials in the rocks and quarries of the world the difference is human intelligence which adapted them for a given purpose similarly any living being possesses an enormous amount of intelligence very much more than is necessary to build the most magnificent of cathedrals today this intelligence is called information but it is still the same thing it is not programmed as in a computer but rather it is condensed on molecular scale in the chromosomal dna or in that of every other organelle in each cell this intelligence is the sine qua non of life where does it come from this is a problem that concerns both biologists and philosophers and at present science seems incapable of solving it if to determine the origin of information in a computer is not a false problem why should the search for the information contained in cellular nuclei be one grass 1977 p 2
3383745 grass was an evolutionist but his dissent from darwinism could hardly have been more radical if he had been a creationist it is not merely that he built a detailed empirical case against the neo darwinian picture of evolution at the philosophical level he challenged the crucial doctrine of
3383746 grass acknowledged that such speculation arouses the suspicions of many biologists because it conjures up visions of the ghost of vitalism or of some mystical power which guides the destiny of living things he defended himself from these charges by arguing that the evidence of genetics zoology and paleontology refutes the darwinian theory that random mutation and natural selection were important sources of evolutionary innovation given the state of the empirical evidence to acknowledge the existence of some as yet undiscovered orienting force that guided evolution was merely to face the facts grass even turned the charges of mysticism against his opponents commenting sarcastically that nothing could be more mystical than the darwinian view that nature acts blindly unintelligently but by an infinitely benevolent good fortune builds mechanisms so intricate that we have not even finished with analysis of their structure and have not the slightest insight of the physical principles and functioning of some of them
3383747 naturalists must remember that the process of evolution is revealed only through fossil forms a knowledge of paleontology is therefore a prerequisite only paleontology can provide them with the evidence of evolution and reveal its course or mechanisms neither the examination of present beings nor imagination nor theories can serve as a substitute for paleontological documents if they ignore them biologists the philosophers of nature indulge in numerous commentaries and can only come up with hypotheses this is why we constantly have recourse to paleontology the only true science of evolution from it we learn how to interpret present occurrences cautiously it reveals that certain hypotheses considered certainties by their authors are in fact questionable or even illegitimate
3383748 evolution of living organisms evidence for a new theory of transformation
3383749 present day ultra darwinism which is so sure of itself impresses incompletely informed biologists misleads them and inspires fallacious interpretations the following is one of the numerous examples found in books today in microorganisms the generation time is rather short and the size of the population can be enormous therefore mutation acts as a very powerful evolutionary process during a shorter lapse of time than in populations of higher organisms levine 1969 p 196 the italics are mine this text suggests that modern bacteria are evolving very quickly thanks to their innumerable mutations now this is not true for millions or even billions of years bacteria have not transgressed the structural frame within which they have always fluctuated and still do it is a fact that microbiologists can see in their cultures species of bacteria oscillating around an intermediate form but this does not mean that two phenomena which are quite distinct should be confused the variation of the genetic code because of a dna copy error and evolution to vary and to evolve are two different things this can never be sufficiently emphasized bacteria which are both the first and the most simple living beings to have appeared are excellent subject material for genetic and biochemical study but they are of little evolutionary value
3383750 biochemists and biologists who adhere blindly to the darwinism theory search for results that will be in agreement with their theories and consequently orient their research in a given direction this intrusion of theories has unfortunate results it deprives observations and experiments of their objectivity makes them biased and moreover creates false problems darwinians have seldom taken fossils into consideration or and this is more serious they have applied the laws of genetics to them without making a critical analysis assuming that the darwinian hypothesis is correct they interpret fossil data according to it it is only logical that they should confirm it the premises imply the conclusions the error in method is obvious
3383751 today our duty is to destroy the myth of evolution considered as a simple understood and explained phenomenon which keeps rapidly unfolding before us biologists must be encouraged to think about the weaknesses of the interpretations and extrapolations that theoreticians put forward or lay down as established truths the deceit is sometimes unconscious but not always since some people owing to their sectarianism purposely overlook reality and refuse to acknowledge the inadequacies and the falsity of their beliefs
3383752 the code of conduct that the naturalist wishing to understand the problem of evolution must adopt is to adhere to facts and sweep away all a priori ideas and dogmas facts must come first and theories must follow the only verdict that matters is the one pronounced by the court as proved facts indeed the best studies on evolution have been carried out by biologists who are not blinded by doctrines and who observe facts coldly without considering whether they agree or disagree with their theories
3383753 thus during the whole history of the therapsids the ancestors of mammals the development of the bony parts of the mandible i e lower jaw and of the motor elements the muscles has been closely coordinated such was also the case for innervation the transformation of the reptilian mandible into the mammalian mandible could only occur thanks to a triple coordination simultaneously involving bones muscles and nerves this is what we call evolution it is not a mosaic of random variations affecting just anything at any time
3383754 mutations do not explain how coordinated variations play upon several organs at a time some lethal or sublethal mutations of a gene produce multiple effects a mutation substituting one or more amino acids for one or more others in the globin of human hemoglobin may depending on its location have serious effects on the structure at various levels and properties of this pigment such as the case of abnormal hemoglobin s in the anemia of cresentic red blood cells drepanocytosis or sickle cell anemia but these pathological cases have no relationship whatsoever with the slow and coherent attainment of a new form of a new function we do not question the existence of the multiple effects i e pleiotropy a single gene can produce but we do not think any geneticist would maintain that the transformations of the jaw of its muscles and nerves of the ossicles of the middle ear etc could be induced by a single gene
3383755 mayr refers to natural selection and maintains that selection pressure was strong in the various forms of theriodonts how does he know his conclusion does not rely on any demographic data we have no knowledge of population densities ecological factors etc nor on ecological or climatic data we know little about the environments in which theriodonts lived how could natural selection give rise to the single mammalian structure while it acted upon populations living in very different environments asia south africa south america environmental conditions change from one continent to the other and the climates were already characterized both in the triassic and in the jurassic how could natural selection in the midst of such diversity manage to favor the same forms everywhere without being inconsistent with the neo darwinian principle that each environment has its own privileged genotype which by chance is better preadapted to it we wonder
3383756 four events have had an immense effect on the evolutionary path these are the synthesis of chlorophyll the change from schizophyte to cell from a single cell to a multicellular organism and from diploblastic metazoans to triploblastic metazoans sexual reproduction by combining in a single being the characteristics of two plus the characteristics of the entire population through the interplay of the consecutive generations has played a fundamental role in the history of the two kingdoms
3383757 the genesis of the fundamental structural plans which characterize the subphyla and classes themselves the main branches of the genealogical tree of the animal kingdom has been the greatest achievement of evolution there have been few creations fewer than twenty phyla and eighty classes for the animal kingdom less than half that many for the plant kingdom they are all very ancient the last major group to date the vertebrates made its appearance with the agnatha ostracoderms cyclostomata during the ordovician 488 444 mya and with jawed fishes during the devonian 416 359 mya some 450 millions years ago since the jurassic 200 145 mya rhaetic 200 million years ago when the first mammals and the precursors of birds portlandian 135 million years ago no new classes have appeared the interruption of the genesis of the fundamental plans and the fact that they are so few in number are two facts that have been underestimated in the attempt to understand evolution the creative powers of evolution have gradually decreased with the aging of the flora and fauna and since the eocene 60 to 33 million years ago the formation of orders has been interrupted eutherian mammals and birds being the last to appear
3383758 from the facts already discussed one notices that the maneuvering space of evolution has never stopped decreasing the genesis of the phyla stopped in the ordovician of the classes in the jurassic of the orders in the paleocene eocene 65 34 mya after the eocene the evolutionary sap still flowed through a few orders since mammals and birds continued to specialize in various directions and invaded all the terrestrial and marine biotopes previously occupied by reptiles the extent of evolutionary novelties gradually changed they no longer affected the structural plan but only involved details the only form which evolution took was speciation in insects since the oligocene 34 23 mya in mollusks since the miocene 23 5 mya in birds and simians since the pliocene 5 2 mya and in some glirines and hominids since the holocene 2 0 mya homo sapiens the last in line is probably 100 000 years old evolution has not only slowed down but with the aging of the biosphere it has also decreased in scope and in extent we are certain that it does not operate today as it did in the remote past something has changed it is of the utmost importance to determine what has changed this should shed light upon the internal mechanisms of the phenomena the structural plans no longer undergo complete reorganization novelties are no longer plentiful evolution after its last enormous effort to form the mammalian orders and man seems to be out of breath and drowsing off
3383759 it has often been noted that despite the presence of all the presumably efficient causes evolution still stops vandel 1972 has recently elaborated a very good example of this the two species of woodlouse of the genus australoniscus a alticolus in nepal and a springetti in western australia have been separated because of the splitting of the gondwana continent and because of continental drift since the beginning of the cretaceous i e approximately 140 to 135 million years ago they differ by a minor characteristic the endopodite end of the first male pleopod is different it is straight in springetti bent into a hook in alticolus thus in 140 million years neither segregation nor mutations there certainly have been some nor selection operating in different environments has provoked any change in these crustaceans
3383760 the evolution of all zoological groups was initially highly productive then slowed down and is now restricted to the creation of new species it seems to us that evolution is not more productive in plants than in animals creative stages ended long ago except in birds and mammals which became individualized at the beginning of the tertiary 65 2 mya and specialized during that era now their evolution is also confined to speciation biologists find it hard to admit that in their basic structure present living beings differ at all from those of the past to begin with such a supposition seems contrary to the scientific spirit but facts are facts no new broad organizational plan has appeared for several hundred million years and for an equally long time numerous species animal as well as plant have ceased evolving
3383761 man is one of the most cosmopolitan terrestrial animals he lives in all kinds of climates he underwent several thousand types of mutations judging from the number of alleles reported in the various human populations presently comprising three billion individuals all showing different genotypes the potential supply of mutants for selection is thus very abundant what has happened then nothing important or even noticeable mutations do differentiate individuals but the human species despite the magnitude of its population and the diversity of its habitats both of which are conditions favorable for the evolution of the human species exhibits anatomical and physiological stability in wealthy western societies natural selection is thwarted by medical care good hygiene and abundant food but it was not always so today in underdeveloped countries where birth and death rates are equally high tropical africa amazonia pakistan india patagonia some polynesian islands natural selection can exert its pressure freely yet the human type hardly changes within each population men differ by their genotype and yet the species homo sapiens has not modified its plan or structure of functions to the common base are added a variety of diversifying and personifying ornaments totally lacking evolutionary value
3383762 natural selection plays a conservative rather than an innovating role the mutations which diverge from the wild type or from the privileged genotype are swept away when the environment changes hence the stability of the species panchronic species living fossils which like other species are subject to the assaults of mutations remain unchanged their variants are eliminated except possibly for neutral mutants in any event their stability is an observed fact and not a theoretical concept
3383763 panchronic species living fossils which like other species are subject to the assaults of mutations remain unchanged
3383764 our logic with its many hypotheses attributes the interruption of biogenesis to changes in the physicochemical conditions prevailing on earth around the earth under the earths surface and in the seas which prevent the synthesis of prebiotic materials once the proteins floating in the ocean waters had been consumed by the first living beings the recurrence of any new biogenesis became impossible this situation required that their immediate successors possess the ability to reproduce on their own as well as a capacity for chemosynthesis their perenniality could not have been maintained without these two conditions
3383765 the number of mutations computed by geneticists is extremely high however the types of mutants are very much fewer in number the source from which arises the evolutionary flow is less important than suggested by darwinians the infinite creative potential of dna is surely not so great as has been claimed mutations have a very limited constructive capacity this is why the formation of hair by mutation of reptilian scales seems to be a phenomenon of infinitesimal probability the formation of mammae by mutation of reptilian integumentary glands is hardly more likely integuments of reptiles show very few integumentary glands gabe and saint girons 1967 etc
3383766 the opportune appearance of mutations permitting animals and plants to meet their needs seems hard to believe yet the darwinian theory is even more demanding a single plant a single animal would require thousands and thousands of lucky appropriate events thus miracles would become the rule events with an infinitesimal probability could not fail to occur much as in the swiss family robinson which i used to read in my childhood rescue would always occur at the right moment and this would have had to have happened throughout the ages one could admit that one bacterium out of billions and billions can be the lucky preadapted one but the number of reptiles evolving into mammals or of primates evolving into men did not exceed a few tens of thousands and often fewer the chances of the appearance of useful mutations therefore decrease in the same ratio and become almost nonexistent
3383767 moreover from what we know of the mechanism of mutations invention in biology has never been the product of a genetic variation it can occur only through the combination of several changes thanks to the coordination of parts the whole is fully functional it materializes a structural plan the origin of which is totally unknown natural selection could not have conceived it and even less constructed it since adequate materials were lacking simpsons opposition to oriented evolution leads ultimately to the denial of evolution in the living world everything would be subject to randomness or change and would occur in just any fashion and at any time simpson offers chaos whereas in fact the living world has evolved and perpetuates itself in an orderly manner
3383768 our study will concentrate on the eye the genesis of which is a major challenge to evolutionists
3383769 we know absolutely nothing about the evolution of the eye of the vertebrate and embryology is of little help the problem is to know whether random mutations could have given rise to an organ requiring because of its complexity a considerable number of data for its elaboration the number of mutations must have been enormous for adequate ones to occur at a given point by chance and to enable the organ to function we need not belabor the diversity of the transparent parts on the relationships between the intraocular fluid aqueous humor and the venous system schlemms canal among others the complexity of the retina of the sheaths etc need not detain us either all this is extremely well known but we must say that no recent publication inspired by darwinism even mentions it
3383770 we took the eye as an example but the ear would have been just as instructive is not the human brain the organ capable of abstraction an even better example even the architecture of the cortex with its 14 billion neurons is not known with any degree of precision in mammals all sense organs evolved almost simultaneously
3383771 if one considers the great number of simultaneous timely mutations satisfying existing needs involved in their genesis one can not fail to be confounded by so much harmony so many lucky coincidences due entirely to omnipotent chance
3383772 selection must complete its work on successive generations and must find in them the materials it needs moreover successive generations reproduce preceding ones otherwise they have no evolutionary value we have already listed the lucky chances required for the slightest evolution to result from mutations p 94 anyone who endorses the random theory of evolution admits that the eye and the ear to become what they are have required thousands and thousands of lucky chances synchronized with the needs of their construction what probability is there of such wonderfully fortuitous success
3383773 natural selection if one admits that it is the builder of the living world can only operate if it possesses the correct building materials needed for the construction of the organ at the right moment what is the use of appropriate mutations if they appear too early or too late in the course of phylogenesis if the formation of the crystalline lens and of the retina had not been closely coordinated the retina is the inducing agent of the anterior parts of the eye the eye could not have formed the necessary mutations could not have occurred independently the influence of the organ extends to structures in its immediate vicinity can one imagine an eye without eyelids or without lachrymal glands moreover these accessories necessarily formed early in the course of evolution the eye is indeed too fragile to be able to do without them the chronology of phenomena in any ontogenesis is inflexible the formation and the subsistence of the living being requires that successive transformations arise in an orderly manner and that its architecture be equally ordered randomness and chance have no place here
3383774 moreover during phylogenetic organogenesis natural selection must be capable of foresight isnt choosing its prime function but the choice cannot take place without predicting the future role of the incipient organ without such prescience the coordination of successive states is incomprehensible did darwin take this into consideration without its predictive powers selection would not be able to favor an incipient organ which at the time had little or no usefulness what sort of advantage could result from the starting of an eye when the materials forming it were not yet transparent of what use was the development of the dentary and the accompanying regression of the proximal jaw bones in theriodont reptiles the ancestors of mammals an answer can always be invented but all this merely adds another supposition to the mass of previous suppositions
3383775 we repeatedly hear that chance is all powerful statements are insufficient evidence must be produced i do not consider the spontaneous appearance of resistance to an antibiotic in a nonresistant population of bacteria as evidence neither structures nor fundamental functions are involved here this is so true that variations of this kind although repeated millions of times have left bacteria practically unchanged
3383776 directed by all powerful selection chance becomes a sort of providence which under the cover of atheism is not named but which is secretly worshipped to insist even with olympian assurance that life appeared quite by chance and evolved in this fashion is an unfounded supposition which i believe to be wrong and not in accordance with the facts
3383777 what interests us for the time being is to what extent the losses suffered by any animal or plant population participate in the evolutionary process the wholesale destruction of eggs spermatozoa seeds and larvae is not selective death does not choose its victims but strikes blindly during development of the embryo and in infancy the elimination of the unfit and of the pathological is fully operative it safeguards the genotype but has no guiding influence in evolution the massive losses caused by natural cataclysms that destroy huge areas are unselective whether for animals or for plants they devastate blindly and are random as to place and circumstance tidal waves floods forest fires bush fires respect no one and nothing at any rate it does not call any novel species into being
3383778 let us not confuse creative evolution with variations in the composition of a population through circumstances they are two distinct things and any attempt to connect them is purely specious
3383779 since evaluation of what is or is not advantageous is impossible in the case of fossil animal populations whatever may be said about the selective value of a given characteristic is pure imagination it is not because individuals with long spines become more numerous in a population of cidarid sea urchins that the characteristic long spine accounts for their predominance this might be a very natural effect of growth continuing with age quite another characteristic resistance to parasites lower embryonic losses etc may be a possible cause where the imagination is given free rein we must learn to control it
3383780 many cases of selection are age old but never modify the species darwins example of the wolf and the deer is a case in point the differences in speed among the individuals making up the population are never eliminated among migrating salmon there is a group too weak to negotiate the rapids or to hurdle the barriers across the rivers up which they have to swim in order to spawn in both examples the individuals eliminated are born of progenitors who overcame these same obstacles since only by so doing were they able to breed the deficient individuals possibly owe their inferiority to the unfavorable conditions in which they developed in fact what is eliminated are acquired not inherited characteristics this illustrates the complexity of phenomena concerning the equilibrium of populations and the limited power of selection
3383781 the lynx feeds on hares and is a fierce predator both high and low figures apply to both populations the hunter and the hunted the struggle is unremitting as the statistics prove the evolutionary effect is nonexistent morphologically and physiologically both hare and lynx remain unchanged
3383782 selection tends to eliminate the causes of a populations heterogeneity and thus to produce a uniform genotype it acts more to conserve the inheritance of the species than to transform it thus these are largely theoretical speculations for natural populations are highly heterogeneous being mainly or entirely composed of heterozygotic individuals it may be added that uniform external appearances often mask a deep rooted heterogeneity the presence in the same population of numerous heterozygotic genotypes is attributable either to the weakness of selection or the neutral or indifferent state of the characteristics determined by the various alleles both possible causes often act together and they insure the persistence of the diverse genotypes there is no need to resort to calculations the reason why natural populations prove on examination to be so highly heterozygotic is that selection works efficiently only against extremely harmful pathogenic genes
3383783 natural selection acts as regulator of the genotype performing a function of genetic hygiene as to its role as effective agent of evolution this is not certain in fact if it had the full power attributed to it it would soon stop evolution every noncarrier of the environmentally adjusted genotype would be eliminated in the event of a change of environment there would be no preadapted genotype to cope with the altered conditions thus natural selection is possible for a population only if it is not too severe
3383784 this is a very grave philosophical and truly anthropomorphic error making selection as an active and transcendental entity selection in nature acts upon species to eliminate the not so good the flawed the disabled that is its chief role
3383785 although a population threatened with destruction by a cataclysm may on occasion be saved by its randomly occurring preadapted mutants there would seem no reason why such exceptional variants would generate a continuous guided evolution as observed in plant or animal lines who would dare argue that the marvelous adaptation to aquatic life and the plumbing of the ocean depths that we see in the whale represent a random collection of properties themselves aleatory in harmony always by chance with an environment and mode of living not yet adopted by the animal yet another random event was the preadapted mammals stumble into the water where he liked it so much he decided to stay such fairy tales like those told by my grandmother for my amusement are not to be taken seriously the chance preadaptations noted so far are confined to a single property elaboration of an enzyme by a mutated gene and have nothing to do with a set of coordinated features their evolutionary importance if any is thereby seriously reduced
3383786 the humblest creature often poses evolutionary problems in stark terms that cannot be escaped by mere rhetoric none is more antichance than the ant lion larva for it offers the naturalist an exceedingly rich collection of coaptations and in all its organs pushes specialization both morphological and physiological to an extreme so we now have to turn to the darwinians and ask have you ever seen a mutation simultaneously affecting two separate components of the body and producing structures that fit one another precisely tell us have you ever beheld three four or five simultaneous mutations with matching structures producing coordinated effects how many chance occurrences would it have taken to build this extraordinary creature that braves the burning sands of the sahara endures prolonged fasting economizes water detects the slightest vibration in the ground lies in wait for days on end at the bottom of a funnel or goes forth freely to hunt down its prey it is not enough for a property to appear it has to come at the right time these accidents always fortunate of course produced their effects by occurring in a certain order for out of order and untimely they would have remained imperative what scientist would venture to estimate the chances of such a cascade such an avalanche of coordinated and mutually adjusted chance occurrences the odds are infinitesimal please remember too that the case of the ant lion is not at all an exceptional one chosen to support a thesis such an accumulation of adaptations and coaptations is the rule
3383787 natural selection working for the continuance and welfare of animals plants and man himself is seen to be the grand law which organizes the living universe
3383788 the role assigned to natural selection in establishing adaptation while speciously probable is based on not one single sure datum paleontology does not support it direct observation here and now of the genesis of a hereditary adaptation is nonexistent except as we have stated in the case of bacteria and insects preadapted to resist viruses or drugs the role of natural selection in the present world of living things is concerned with the balance of populations it is primarily of demographic interest to assert that population dynamics gives a picture of evolution in action is an unfounded opinion or rather a postulate that relies on not a single proved fact circumstances occasionally award a given mutation a selectivity bonus but for a variable time as witness the heterogeneity of populations due to the abundance of alleles of a single gene and their composition over time studies on natural populations in their own proper environment show that the composition of genes is changeable and that dominant species vary over time the gene composition of populations changes continually by the occurrence of mutants for tens of millions of years populations of drosophila have undergone millions of mutations what is left of them the insignificant modifications discovered by laborious analysis these tiny disorderly fluctuations of genes start no new line they are apparently unconnected with the great process that has given birth to types and subtypes of organization no experiment justifies the assimilation of demographic changes of population to a slice of evolution as an innovative creative process
3383789 let us go a step further what need do reptiles have for a secondary palate a mandible reduced to a dentary only suitable for mammals lizards snakes and tortoises have gone on living with no partition in their buccal cavity no complexly structured mandible there was no necessity for theriodonts to acquire a secondary palate which really served a purpose only in the case of mammals by creating in the splanchnic skull two superimposed and separate stories one for respiration and another for food in the case of the theriodont we might speak as cuenot did with respect to other animals about prophetic organs
3383790 evolution as revealed by fossil remains of plants and animals does not bear the characteristics attributed to it by theory from one parental stock we get variants that are perpetuated in their offspring in one or more lines
3383791 the changeover from aquatic to terrestrial life was probably preceded in the case of rhipidistian crossopterygii by a long evolution preparatory to adaptation to the new environment and involving internal factors it had to affect not an isolated characteristic but the organism as a whole since the variations had to be coordinated if they were to be meaningful and effective and consequently could not depend on chance
3383792 we are that much less inclined to accept the story of the little magellan of evolution fish since the mudskippers periophthalmus and boleophthalmus very specifically reproduce its experiment they hop about on the mud climb onto the roots of the mangroves and stand upright on their pectoral fins as if on short legs for millions of years they have lived like this and although they are hopping around all the time however clumsily their fins are still fins and do not turn into legs how terribly unaccommodating of these animals
3383793 what need did the diploblastic animals have to acquire a third layer we can try to find out since we can put down on paper whatever we like but arriving at the truth is quite another matter and these diploblastics although engendering triploblastics still continue with no sign of abatement
3383794 evolution went on the necessity inherent in the achievement of the living creature was fully satisfied but who shall tell us what necessity there was for life to appear on earth at all this question is not addressed to the biologists for it concerns the transcendental let the philosopher or theologian answer it if he can
3383795 after impartial investigation which i have carried on for years i am in a position to conclude that 1 the lamarckian and darwinian theories in whatever form do not resolve the major evolutionary problem that of the genesis of the main systematic units the fundamental organizational schemes 2 they fail to account for a great many fundamental aspects and phenomena of evolution 3 we have not yet obtained from the fossil record all the information it is capable of yielding
3383796 freeing our minds of theoretical notions wherever they may have come from let us take an honest look at the phenomenon of evolution and in all objectivity set aside the accepted doctrines notably every form of darwinism i have proved that evolution is not the product of natural selection
3383797 moreover it may be taken as proved that since adaptation is seldom perfect the living creature makes do with a compromise in respect to its environment in the broadest sense it survives despite its comparative inadaptation provided its physiological balance sheet is sound interspecific competition is very far from being universal death is more often blind and unselective than it is discriminating
3383798 i have shown with a great many facts how far mutations fall short of the evolutionary variations that gave rise to phyla classes orders etc in order to create evolution demands new materials such as genes formed de novo or untried patterns of overprinted codons it is not at all the same gene that from one class of vertebrates to another induces the tegumentary ectoblast and its mesenchymatous lining to form ganoid placoid or cycloid scales in fishes epidermal osseous scales in reptiles feathers in birds hair in mammals every novelty demands its own genes which are themselves also novelties
3383799 the true course of evolution is and can only be revealed by paleontology
3383800 each evolution that we know about in some detail genesis of amphibians reptiles mammals history of the various orders of mammals and so on forces us to admit that a phenomenon whose equivalent cannot be seen in the creatures living at the present time either because it is not there or because we are unable to see it occurs in the course of it for this phenomenon the cell is both the instrument and the effector it paves the way for the evolution of living things it does so in accordance with the influence exerted on the organism by external factors and by certain internal ones connected with the chemistry of living things
3383801 as a non darwinian i am not directly concerned in this debate but simply note that biologists do while remaining faithful to the principles laid down by the founder recognize that these do not entirely account for evolution and in particular that natural selection acting on populations is incapable of guiding evolution
3383802 at the risk of repeating myself mutations do not explain either the nature or the temporal ordering of evolutionary facts they do not account for innovations the precise arrangements of the component parts of organs and the mutual adjustments of organs are beyond their capacity
3383803 this is what an american geneticist has to say on the subject yet being an effective policeman natural selection is extremely conservative by nature had evolution been entirely dependent upon natural selection from a bacterium only numerous forms of bacteria would have emerged the creation of metazoans vertebrates and finally mammals from unicellular organisms would have been quite impossible for such big leaps in evolution required the creation of new gene loci with previously nonexistent functions ohno 1970 all this is rather obvious but if people wilfully close their eyes to it they will not see
3383804 biochemists take as a pretext the heterogeneous structure of dna and the transcription of its information by rna to proclaim the dogma of dna being not only the depository and sole distributor of the specific information available to the living creature but of its presiding over the very genesis of that information dna does not manifest its properties let us say its powers unless the cytoplasm conceived in its totality allows it to do so through the life cycle from the ovum to the adult animal via the genesis of the gametes and fertilization dna retains its structure this is undeniable but its activation depends on the circumambient cytoplasm the organism is a whole dna alone can do nothing
3383805 information forms and animates the living organism evolution is in the end the process by which the creature modifies its information and acquires other information
3383806 mutation is an accident or disease having only a remote bearing on the evolutionary process this is proved by the independence of mutagenesis with respect to evolution
3383807 now we know and must bear in mind that as the world of living beings has grown older evolution has never ceased to dwindle why are evolutionary reactions becoming rarer in our present state of knowledge it is futile to ask when molecular biology has increased in accuracy and refinement we may be able to find the answer
3383808 but according to darwinian doctrine and cricks central dogma dna is not only the depository and distributor of the information but its
3383809 the whole range of mutations or mutational spectrum of a species has nothing to do with evolution the jordanons mutants of whitlow grass erophila verna the wild pansy viola tricolor plantains plantago candytuft iberis which constitute well catalogued and rich collections are irrefutable proof of this they are not derived from one another and are indefinitely stable they display the species with all its collection of invariant variants translating so to speak oscillations in the polymorphy of a specific unit about the equilibrium state of a genome in its environment thus despite their innumerable mutations erophila verna viola tricolor and the rest do not evolve this is a fact
3383810 the catalogue of breeds of dogs as of any other domestic animal is simply the mutational spectrum of the species sifted by artificial selection the same can be said of the list of varieties of any cultivated plant nothing of all this constitutes evolution
3383811 genetics textbooks are extremely discreet about the formation of new genes they ignore this problem of primordial importance in any explanation of evolution no formation of new genes has been observed by any biologist yet without it evolution becomes inexplicable a gene formed can function only with the aid of a specific enzyme that opens out the dna molecule at its level and enables synthesis of the message bearing rna such a requirement diminishes the chances of a random successful synthesis since formation of the enzyme is just as unlikely as that of the gene in order to create evolution has to win not just on one count but on two or even three in theory this is possible but a low probability is not far from zero besides is it not presumptuous to try to explain a phenomenon that has held to a precisely plotted course for thousands of years by a mechanism based on the most slender expectation of success
3383812 the dependence of dna on genic activators nucleotide producers and probably also rna producers originally implies a dual creation of a gene plus its activator the gene and its activator s contained in the nuclear sap or the cytoplasm must have been first simultaneously or consecutively obtained here again we see the difference between mutation and innovation in the former the gene changes and the corresponding activator is always present in the cytoplasm the genes expressivity is constant in the latter it is likely possible or at any rate that the birth of the new gene is not synchronous with the genesis of its activators lacking an activator for the gene innovation cannot occur
3383813 in summary the creative evolutionary process conceived according to the data of molecular biology involves three events 1 formation of a new meaningful sequence of codons 2 formation of a specific enzyme to activate the new gene 3 adequate identification of the enzyme depending upon cellular differentiation but nothing of all this accounts for the orientation of evolution or the finality of the information
3383814 let us end our survey by drawing up a balance sheet while still unsatisfactory it has some favorable aspects and dispels of one or two interpretations often presented as certainties 1
3383815 any system that purports to account for evolution must invoke a mechanism not mutational and aleatory this is indeed what the reformist darwinians and lamarckian biologists realize hence their recourse to internal factors the united efforts of paleontology and molecular biology the latter stripped of its dogmas should lead to the discovery of the exact mechanism of evolution possibly without revealing to us the causes of the orientations of lineages of the finalities of structures of living functions and of cycles perhaps in this area biology can go no farther the rest is metaphysics
3383816 that evolution is a mystery about which little is and perhaps can be known
3383817 evolution is a mystery about which little is and perhaps can be known
3383818 giard 1905 himself a shrewd scholar but blinded by a foolish anticlericalism went so far as to abjure lamarckism and write
3383819 evolution of living organisms evidence for a new theory of transformation

3383825 when all kinds of trials and temptations crowd into your lives my brothers dont treat them as intruders but as friends realize that they come to test your faith and to produce in you the quality of endurance you will find you have become men of mature character men of integrity with no weak spots
3383826 yeah just look at this thing look at what it can do i could drive this baby up the side of a building
3383827 are you kidding do you know how much i paid for this thing no way in fact i was just on the way to the car wash
3383828 you know you have a lot of really great beliefs you talk about them all the time i think its time you started putting some of them into practice you talk about how you trust me you talk about how you believe i can provide for your every need let me put you in a situation where you have no other resources and really have to trust me for that provision

3383830 but at midnight paul and silas were praying and singing hymns to god and the prisoners were listening to them
3383831 at once the prison doors flew open and everybodys chains came loose
3383832 ive been watching you guys ive seen how you have taken such terrible punishment without cursing ive seen how you can worship in the worst circumstances and how you could have escaped but didnt all i can say is whatever you have i want it
3383833 my gracious favor is all you need my power works best in your weakness
3383834 so now i am glad to boast about my weaknesses so that the power of christ may work through me since i know it is all for christs good i am quite content with my weaknesses and with insults hardships persecutions and calamities for when i am weak then i am strong
3383835 they played very well it was a high level soccer game between two very good teams
3383836 there was more at stake for sweden of course and you could see they were very pumped up for the task so were my players they had qualified but the players kept their focus very well
3383837 theres a huge rivalry between them and us we get excited to play the u s all the time and now we get to do it in the olympics
3383838 many of my patients are now requesting shoulders like madonna and keira knightley
3383839 surgeons in new york have reported a rise in the number of women undergoing shoulder liposuction
3383840 i do lipo on almost every area of the body and even many areas most people dont but the shoulders themselves are an area i have never seen that needs to be done i strongly feel that if someone has fat shoulders then it typically is a musculoskeletal issue of larger muscles and bones and maybe that they need to lose weight

3383861 the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about senator obamas judgment it answers them
3383862 would kicking russia out of the g 8 have stopped this invasion
3383863 i dont see how those two are related that is the test of leadership are you proposing things that can advance american interests
3383864 to condemn russias aggression to call for an immediate halt to the violence and to review multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia including russias interest in joining the world trade organization
3383865 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on

3383875 we are not at peace yet but we are at a stage of temporary cessation of hostilities which is certainly significant
3383876 we will need more evidence everyone in this situation needs a binding agreement until that happens we are mobilised we are prepared for everything
3383877 there has been more damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties today
3383878 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses
3383879 if this news that military operations are stopping is correct then it is what this country needs and we can then get on to build peace

3383886 if youve ever been to an emergency room one of the first questions they ask you is to rate your pain on a scale of 1 to 10
3383887 how are we supposed to figure out what to do with our lives
3383888 just pick a project that seems interesting to master some chunk of material or to make something or to answer some question
3383889 dont worry if a project doesnt seem to be on the path to some goal youre supposed to have paths can bend a lot more than you think so let the path grow out the project the most important thing is to be excited about it because its by doing that you learn
3383890 a person can perform only from strength one cannot build performance on weakness let alone on something one cannot do at all
3383891 discover where your intellectual arrogance is causing disabling ignorance and overcome it first rate engineers for instance tend to take pride in not knowing anything about people but taking pride in such ignorance is self defeating go to work on acquiring the skills you need to fully realize your strengths
3383892 we all have a vast number of areas in which we have no talent or skill and little chance of becoming even mediocre in those areas a knowledge workers should not take on work jobs and assignments it takes far more energy to improve from incompetence to mediocrity than it takes to improve from first rate performance to excellence
3383893 what i feared most for myself at your age was not poverty but failure
3383894 so why do i talk about the benefits of failure simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential i stopped pretending to myself that i was anything other than what i was and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me i was set free because my greatest fear had already been realized and i was still alive and i still had a daughter whom i adored and i had an old typewriter and a big idea

3383897 oil demand data are coming in weaker on an underlying trend basis
3383898 this only reinforces the view that high prices are beginning to play a central role in determining demand at least for the oecd countries
3383899 remains high by any measure sustaining inflationary concerns not least in developing importer countries
3383900 while oecd demand could still surprise us on the downside non oecd prospects particularly for china and the middle east gulf could be subject to upside adjustment
3383901 this is real entertainment what the fuck am i doing talking about my pain wheres the pleasure in that who in their right mind would want to hear about that wheres the skill wheres the craft im too lazy and insecure to even write a joke

3383903 its probably best thought of as work for people weve already got its a little too soon to say what the long term implications will be
3383904 its a brand new vehicle and the typical product development time for a new vehicle is 24 to 36 months were going to do it in a little bit faster than 24 months
3383905 suffice to say we think we think well produce more than the 3 500 weve got pretty strong confidence this vehicle will be in high demand
3383906 the flames wont beat the sharks but lets have fun anyway
3383907 i started in lapidary sawing grinding and polishing stone and shell
3383908 i was always amazed at how beautiful the materials were and the fact that they came straight out of the earth or bottom of the sea i still get that feeling today with our new designs combining the art of jewelry design and the technology involved with the production process is still very challenging and rewarding even 30 plus years later
3383909 while many u s jewelry manufacturers have found it more profitable to farm work out to other countries weve relios chosen to stay and uphold our made in the usa value system and its paid off
3383910 of course there are certain concessions weve had to make there are hardly any stone cutters left in the u s so many of our stones and beads are sourced worldwide but everything else is done right here at our albuquerque factory from design modeling the original and casting to stone setting and assembly all right here under one roof it helps us serve our customers better to have that kind of quality control
3383911 consistent customer service has gotten us where we are today and thats not all
3383912 were relios very committed to the idea that in order to be successful all stakeholders must be satisfied employees customers vendors and shareholders we focus a lot on employee team building
3383913 and the end result is a higher level of participation enthusiasm and pride in satisfying its customers it really is based on a strong set of principles and a commitment to continuous improvement

3383917 these guys had a number of opportunities to make the right choices and unfortunately a number of times they actually made the wrong ones
3383918 these guys were severely punished in the form of suspension and fines and they face real uncertainty as to where their future lies
3383919 they took risks and they made bad choices and theyre now suffering the consequences

3383939 we are not mindless fans we will open our wallets to stop this smear our idolization of barack the beautimous is not because of his celebrity we follow obama because of his many policy position papers items things he is dreamy

3383961 we ask motorists to take care be patient and observe the safety speed limits while road works are under way
3383962 in an effort to minimise the impact to motorists were trying to keep things consistent during the day and schedule works needing major speed reductions at night or in off peak
3383963 this is a 1 billion plus project they really should be giving motorists a better deal
3383964 we are aware of the problem of covering old line marking
3383965 we are looking at what technology is available in the short term to make line marking clearer for the motorist before we do the final resurfacing of the whole road
3383966 during construction we are monitoring this and undertaking maintenance where and when required
3383967 this is the biggest issue facing australia and there needs to be a big systemic change
3383968 we need to help employers think laterally about how to support carers by giving them things like 12 months leave being flexible with work hours and larger employers can look at what they can do on site to support staff juggling these roles
3383969 it was once a held view that women would give up their careers to be the carer but theyve invested so much into their careers and education that now they want to work and we need ways to help them keep working
3383970 if you added up the cost of the work these unpaid carers do it would cost australia more than 30 billion a year

3383982 rather than just complaining to an empty house chamber congressman kuhl should use his personal relationship with president bush to ask him to call congress back into session to deal with the problem
3383983 representative kuhl believes that i dont understand the washington process hes right i dont and neither do the vast majority of americans who know the washington process is broken thats what this election is about building a new process and starting over i dont understand why congress cant take real action to find real solutions to our nations problems i dont understand why career washington politicians like mr kuhl cant get anything done when hes worked so hard to maintain such a close personal relationship with president bush
3383984 initially mr kuhl stated that the lives of our children and the future of our country were at risk then he stated that he objected to the release and backfill of any of our strategic petroleum reserve because the situation was not urgent and now he feels that having an argument in an empty congressional chamber is more important than getting our president to call congress back to deal with this problem washington politicians want the problem for a campaign issue but they dont want a solution so we can all pay our home heating bill
3383985 it is a shame representative kuhl has decided to engage in negative political showmanship rather than working for a real solution to our nations energy crisis the president should call congress back in session today we need an open and honest debate for all america to witness he should immediately direct the federal reserve and the treasury to take all steps possible to strengthen the value of the dollar so that the price of crude oil will immediately drop and we must now start developing plans on how we will help new yorkers get through winter mr kuhl has a long record of talking a good game in western new york but when he goes to washington he prefers to play the dc special interest game

3384015 they begin to get the earliest forms of disability about 16 years later than do the controls
3384016 they have the same or fewer knee replacements or destroyed knees they have less musculoskeletal pain they spend less money on medical care expenses and by any metric that you use they have benefited from their lifelong exercise habit
3384017 compress the morbidity of the average life into a shorter and shorter period between when the disability comes and when one dies
3384018 this was a radical change in the way people were then thinking about it and there were no real data
3384019 the other third for the most part changed to other vigorous athletic activities and they changed for the reasons you wouldnt have thought they changed because they moved away or they lost their running partner everything but knee pain they never changed for knee pain almost never
3384020 they kept the habit of exercise although some people got bored with running and quit because they were bored
3384021 if we can deal with prevention of medical treatment through looking after ourselves better exercising vigorously eating well those sorts of factors then it makes sense that well have reduced disability and premature mortality
3384022 were all going to die some day but we want to compress that to the final days of our life if we can
3384023 i suppose the simplest one is that vigorous serious exercise regularly over a lifetime swapping off into another exercise if you have some difficulty with one of the exercises is a very very good way to go
3384024 we found out that konstantinovs doping test was positive when we were at our training camp in korea before the games there were suspicions and new tests were made but we received the results when we were already in beijing as the tests were positive again it was decided that konstantinov should not take part in the game against china in order not to jeopardize the participation of the whole team

3384067 the emotions of love and friendship youd assume would be missing or rotten in these communities existing even more so for their being sought amidst illegality fragmentation and betrayal

3384069 i was completely unaware of the scale of the aids epidemic in india before i took part in this project
3384070 i was both intellectually challenged and emotionally moved by what i saw and learned when an epidemic gains a human face and you actually meet people who are dying of this disease everything changes
3384071 we simply dont like to talk about it even to impart or receive essential life saving information
3384072 none of the doctors i met had initially been trained to face the disease what they were now was shaped by it and hiv had confronted each in a slightly different incarnation a rumour a makeshift pedagogy a death

3384093 the shortest life expectancy is among recycled material collectors a trade popular among roma as a means to earn their living
3384094 their life expectancy is around 45 years due to the extremely hard conditions surrounding them
3384095 one does not have to rely on statistics to see the poverty that prevails among roma
3384096 there are 593 roma settlements surrounding the big cities of serbia without any infrastructure or normal living standards
3384097 this ruling could have an impact on many countries in europe

3384100 how far do our feelings take their colour from the dive underground i mean what is the reality of any feeling
3384101 the great majority of patients who sustain a medical injury as a result of negligence do not sue
3384102 recent studies have found that one of every 100 hospital patients suffers negligent treatment and that as many as 98 000 die each year as a result only a small fraction of injured patients perhaps 2 percent press legal claims
3384103 just 1 1 percent of all doctors accounted for 30 percent of all malpractice payments made between 1990 and 2002 while only 5 2 percent of doctors were responsible for 55 percent of all payouts

3384119 the first thing i noticed when testing flock 2 was the speed at which the program now operates
3384120 if youre a normal user who only has a few tabs open at a time you might notice a slight difference however if youre like me the number of tabs you keep open is larger than youd like to admit in previous versions this would slow down flock to an almost unusable speed now flock opens closes and loads new pages just as fast as you need it to it also uses fewer system resources so multitasking is possible again

3384122 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3384123 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3384124 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3384125 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3384126 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3384127 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
3384128 man i am so ready to play b a baracus i was a big big mr t fan
3384129 so we will never again be faced with the situation where one state fails to pass on information to another and a doctor who is not practising well or who is practising beyond his or her level of accreditation will be pulled up very very quickly and wont be able to be employed in another jurisdiction
3384130 before the end of the year queensland will introduce the first piece of legislation which all other states and territories will sign on to as the first step to establish a national registration scheme for doctors and other allied health professionals including nurses
3384131 so were getting to the sharp end of the development of the national registration system to be up and running by the middle of the 2010
3384132 it was agreed that queensland would be the host state which im particularly proud of

3384140 thats what the chinese do so well against us they fight when theyre down then come back
3384141 they never give us anythng so it was fantastic to turn that on them for a change and come back from five points down in the third set
3384142 it was probably the best eight or nine points we have played against one of the best pairs in the world
3384143 it might have meant a tiny bit more being chinese in the first round in china
3384144 and the fact she beat us in the olympic final four years ago might have given us a little bit more incentive but its the and all that
3384145 i just want to get on with the next match now
3384146 planet earth needs me and a veto proof democrat majority in the house and a filibuster proof democrat majority in the senate in order to save the planet
3384147 therefore in the interest of saving the planet i will yield on the drilling issue at least until obama and fellow socialists take over the us government
3384148 however once the elections are in the books i promise to get back to work for the citizens of the world by shutting down all drilling and outlawing the combustion engine in america

3384157 they were fresh honest and had what i thought a sort of presence and star quality whatever that is
3384158 brian put us in suits and all that and we made it very very big
3384159 we were in a daydream till he came along we had no idea what we were doing
3384160 its my wifes fault about three years ago she got us on a park district bus trip to a boat in iowa and i hit a slot jackpot for 1 034 weve been going every couple of months ever since
3384161 it was my wifes birthday we went to the roulette table together minimum bets were 5 and minimum chip value was 1 she just plays red or black or sometimes odd or even but i decided to spread a few bucks in the middle
3384162 what i actually did was to add an extra dollar and bet 2 each on three numbers
3384163 i wanted my wifes birthday oct 26 so i bet 2 on 10 and 2 on 26 then i took the third 2 and put it on our anniversary the 18th
3384164 hah id have figured you for something more scientific but wait till you hear what happened
3384165 the first spin was 26 so i won right away the second spin was 18 so now id won on both a birthday number and the anniversary and this is what floored me the third spin was 10 id won single number bets on the first three spins we were playing with three different numbers
3384166 seems like i should have made more money with odds like that i figure i came out 198 ahead for those three spins could i have made more
3384167 fresh juices nectars purees coulis homemade mixes and fresh garnishes
3384168 i just never felt it was the right time to make the jump with my wife being self employed i just didnt think we wanted to be put in the situation where we didnt have at least one steady stream of income but the world series changed all of that
3384169 the guy who won the poker on espn the other night
3384170 its been a lot of fun to hear from people who i havent talked to in a long long time theyre all really happy for me
3384171 i was more nervous watching the show than i was when i played at the final table
3384172 you never know how many hands theyre going to show or what theyre going to say about you i also knew that my mother was miked up for the whole thing and i had no idea what she was going to be saying it was a surreal experience sitting there in front of the tv watching myself
3384173 i made sure that i didnt show up any of my opponents and i dont think i got real excited until i actually won it
3384174 and my mom kind of stole the show in the telecast i feel bad because she got more face time that my heads up opponent james akenhead which is too bad because he played great my moms really enjoying this shes become a mini celebrity as well and shes also heard from a lot of people she hasnt been in contact with for a while
3384175 i was trying to keep a low profile because the episode of me winning hadnt been on tv yet and i figured nobody knew what i looked like
3384176 but every time i reached for my chips the cameras would zoom in on me and the boom mike would be hanging over my head after about an hour someone at the table finally said why are they taping you and i had to explain that the whole story to everyone
3384177 i just tell them that the heads up match lasted 2 hours and it was just going back and forth the whole time and the aggression for both of us kept escalating
3384178 he was betting a lot when he had nothing and i was doing the same that time i made what looked like a pretty bad move but it worked out for me thats for sure
3384179 ive never been out of the united states so i want to try and play in some events in some locations where it will be fun to travel to
3384180 if you get knocked out of a tournament early on and youre in the caribbean its not such a bad thing

3384184 the minister has informed me that the cupar test centre will close on 30th september 2008 but i am not prepared to accept this without a fight
3384185 i have called on the minister to review this decision and to carry out an up to date examination of local circumstances which in my view more than justifies keeping the cupar centre open
3384186 i think that our preseason pick is reflective of where we finished last year
3384187 i dont like to have a big target on my back so id rather be under the radar instead of everyone gunning for you

3384191 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3384192 we are heartbroken he will be deeply missed he was a wonderful kind and gentle man
3384193 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
3384194 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
3384195 that is a pretty amazing statistic but not so hard to understand given the intense marketing of psa testing for so many years
3384196 one thing that is often missing in the psa discussion is the level of risk men face this is of course crucial information how else can you weigh the potential benefits and known harms if you dont know your chances to begin with unfortunately the risk information isnt usually part of the discussion or when it is its usually given in aggregate terms for example you will read that 220 000 men were diagnosed last year or 28 000 died those numbers hide the fact that the risk changes dramatically with age the numbers also do not provide context ie competing risks of death for interpreting the risk
3384197 the paper shows how we developed risk charts which present the 10 year chance of death from various causes and all causes combined at different ages with regards to prostate cancer the charts show that for younger men there isnt a lot of risk to reduce with screening out of 1000 men less than 1 will die of prostate cancer in the next 10 years another way of saying that is more than 999 will not die of prostate cancer during this time
3384198 mr suskind reports that the bush administration in its pursuit of war created and promoted forged documents about iraq
3384199 i am particularly troubled that the decision to disseminate this fabricated intelligence is alleged to have come from the highest reaches of the administration

3384202 so it shouldnt come as much of a surprise that the overwhelming number of victims and perpetrators of violence are black men
3384203 lift the veil of shame and encourage other young african americans to confront their depression and really understand that they can actually take steps to feel better
3384204 fact is depression favors no one multimillion dollar contracts cant protect you from it nor can celebrity
3384205 depression doesnt make you weak stupid or to blame and it sure doesnt make you less of a man
3384206 and kevin would say would you pay attention to yourself and everything that we are doing he always sets us straight and puts us in line

3384237 viewers will be deeply moved by the participants personal journeys i believe that a major nationwide evangelism initiative could be launched on the back of this series
3384238 why should we keep the law if christ has kept the law for us
3384239 mark you this bassanio the devil can cite scripture for his purpose an evil soul producing holy witness is like a villain with a smiling cheek a goodly apple rotten at the heart o what a goodly outside falsehood hath
3384240 if christs sufferings were incidental elements of the wrath of god which he bore as the surety of the elect then why must the elect still suffer in this life
3384241 as suffering it was a vicarious endurance of the penalty of sin
3384242 to refine us and conform us to the image of christ
3384243 there is no creature either in heaven or on earth who loves us more than jesus christ
3384244 interesting that you ask that question ben because one of the things that canadian bands have a reputation for is being great live acts part of that is because we have a very large country and we have to tour across it many times just to build a career but promoters around the world love when canadian acts come through their markets
3384245 the odds nickelback three days grace april wine elliott brood and i could keep going
3384246 all of that incredible live performing has resulted in some incredible sales lots of grammys in the last 10 years weve been shining on the grammys and all international fronts for the last 10 15 years and more than that so were representing big time
3384247 well im expecting that we can get past this lame part of the show where you ask us an inane question and we give you a petty pat answer and get on with finding out who is the next canadian idol
3384248 i think amberlys very girl next door and thats cool i think people can connect to her guys or girls
3384249 i always feel theres a lot of really good girl singers and a little bit less guy singers that are amazing so for you you have to pick those songs that are unique because youve got a very beautiful voice so you picked the right one
3384250 her voice and personality are a breath of fresh air you dont feel like shes trying to be something shes not shes just herself and i think it really comes off as very genuine
3384251 amberly first of all i think vocally it was a really strong performance i think that while you didnt do a lot to the song in terms of trying to make it your own it was basically the arrangement that feist does you did a really good job of it
3384252 i agree with both jake and sass but what i would say is you couldve used the stage a lot more
3384253 youre an athlete swallow up the stage and use the space a song like that is really vibrant and energetic and fun so i wouldve liked to see you be a little more expansive in terms of how you use the stage and engaged the audience
3384254 i like that he is classically trained you can tell hes got a thick kind of warm voice
3384255 you dont even realize hes playing piano because you dont even notice it it seems that easy for him which i think is great
3384256 we saw your performance from last week when youre standing up and walking around and its really cool but i think you belong on the piano you look so comfortable very into it
3384257 a lot of times if you try and please everyone people can see through it and if you feel youre passionate about what you do then thats all that matters
3384258 wow theo man i think what i enjoyed the most about that performance was not just the way that you rode the melody like the waves of the melody so well but also the physicality of the performance was really killing and that last note man whooo
3384259 i think that performance is a really interesting thing kind of study because from my perspective its probably the truest and best youve done but what it says to me the way i really see you as an artist is that youre kind of in this rufus wainwright kind of cool vibe eclectic kind of unique person and i wonder whether canadas ready to embrace that as an idol
3384260 you have to look like you enjoy what youre doing and that youre immersed in the song and you did that
3384261 with that kind of song for me whats important is that you look honest and you look like you believe what youre singing and you love that song
3384262 mitch i really thought that was a really comfortable performance that you took ownership of that song i hadnt heard it before either but what i really appreciated was the honesty with which you sang it and you look great tonight by the way that was a really smart song selection
3384263 its funny that you said paul simon because thats exactly what i was thinking
3384264 i think you were thinking the same thing too farley you know mitch what i really liked about the performance as much as your singing is i liked how you integrated the guitar playing with your singing the picking i think it really added a nice touch to the actual song and i think joel plaskett will be very happy because hes probably going to sell a lot of at least downloads tonight if not tomorrow
3384265 the phrasing was really precise and really powerful and you were into it you were intense which i think is really cool
3384266 you dove into the song and thats important because a lot of times youll be playing in front of people that dont really want to see you weve opened up for bands before and everyone is just waiting for me to get off stage and thats when you kind of use that as fuel you kind of say im going to win you over and i think you did that
3384267 i thought it was really cool to meet him because he was very nice and kind of shy and thats a good thing because you want to root for him you want to like him so i like that
3384268 i think that especially coming out here on cheese ball idol stage and trying to do something where you rock like that was really strong ill give you that
3384269 to me theres not a lot you can do with that song that doesnt sound like the hip so to me it was kind of hip y to begin with so i think it was really good but im sure it scared the hell out of my grandma
3384270 earl i was in the studio when that song was recorded ive probably seen it performed live i dont know 5 000 times i will tell you its very hard to do a song by the tragically hip because gords phrasing is a certain way and his voice sounds a certain way and very rarely have i seen anybody actually re invent a hip song until tonight
3384271 youre unabashed youre uninhibited youre just out here to be earl quintessential earl i love it
3384272 i would say that when you look at you it looks easy when you look so confident that its like its just a breeze you have to sort of inject some passion
3384273 i dont disagree with that there was just a couple of lines where you were cutting it off a little too short but when you got to that soft part oh my god that was the money
3384274 i thought your voice sounded really good but i agree with these guys though
3384275 you have a particular niche that i think you need to really really thrust yourself through and figure it out youre an emotional guy but you dont push to the edge for some reason i dont know what it is youve got to try ive said it before youve got to be a little more animated
3384276 mookie i like him a lot he belongs on stage it feels thats his whole thing
3384277 hes got the look hes got the attitude he looks like a star
3384278 youve got the style the whole attitude side the whole show thing thats all good just make sure you maintain the technical aspect of it because you have it so just keep it in mind
3384279 first of all thank you for bringing turntables to the canadian idol stage i feel gratification for that also dude youre just unbelievably charismatic everything you touch youre a star youve just got to choose which galaxy you want
3384280 probably the most exciting thing ive seen in a long time
3384281 these three words lend themselves to a variety of elements that we will all need to have in the future in order to be successful
3384282 we will need to imagine a world without workplace injuries to create innovative solutions to keep workers safe and to inspire and be inspired to continue working towards zero
3384283 i ran out of gas i i had a flat tire i didnt have enough money for cab fare my tux didnt come back from the cleaners an old friend came in from out of town someone stole my car there was an earthquake a terrible flood locusts it wasnt my fault i swear to god
3384284 theres a lot of patients who are using these medications who may not need these or may be able to use a different medication that doesnt have these side effects
3384285 if someone has a hip fracture their chance of dying is 20 per cent in six months
3384286 even those who dont die as a result of it theyre still often left with significant disability and loss of independence
3384287 furthermore use has been increasing in recent years likely because of a number of factors including increasing affordability with the emergence of generic and over the counter formulations
3384288 i think patients who are on these medications should discuss it with their physician
3384289 mark you this bassanio the devil can cite scripture for his purpose an evil soul producing holy witness is like a villain with a smiling cheek a goodly apple rotten at the heart o what a goodly outside falsehood hath
3384290 but it is too early for miaoke to be part of the world of entertainment

3384300 well theres not really any one particular way to be saved in fact there are many different ways to heaven that is if you believe there is a heaven which would mean you believe there is a hell which we really dont like to talk about perhaps you could come to our coffee shop sometime and join the conversation and tell us what salvation means to you

3384302 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3384303 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3384304 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3384305 over the years the endangered species act has become a regulatory nightmare that kills or stalls even the most well crafted land use projects

3384323 one of the differences from the original show are really having a strong adult storyline one of the povs that gabe and i come from as producers and writers on this show is a strong point of view on parenting were both fathers we feel like this central family this core family moves into beverly hills and its how do they hold onto their sort of moral center we think this generation of parenting is different than the ones we grew up with we as parents did almost everything that our kids are doing our parents didnt do that its a lot harder to lie to us we know what theyre doing and they cant get away with stuff that they think they are because we did it 20 years ago

3384344 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3384345 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3384346 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3384347 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3384348 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people were just like any other people out there we want to be ourselves and not be discriminated against
3384349 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3384350 no changes or cuts to the film will be made

3384352 this population struggles too much with the basics to have to struggle against hollywood were sending a message that this hate speech is no longer acceptable
3384353 these politicians all think they have a novel in them and theyre taking that old adage and are writing what they know politics
3384354 readers have already seen six points of view on what its like to be a lawmaker so the seventh and eighth dont really offer anything they havent already heard
3384355 just because youre an elected official doesnt mean people are going to spend money on you
3384356 out of 535 members no more than 10 of them should be writing books
3384357 look hes a top contender for vice president and hes a u s senator but does he have anything good to say no
3384358 the last thing the world needs is another forgettable lawmaker its the equivalent of a speech on c span
3384359 from father to son a private life in the public eye
3384360 bill clinton writing an autobiography is much better than bill clinton writing a book on charity
3384361 the better known the politician and the closer to the bone the better the book is going to be
3384362 the thing about publishing is that books can confer and bestow a certain gravitas and seriousness that nothing else can
3384363 people take you more seriously even though most of the time the lawmakers only sell a few thousand copies
3384364 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
3384365 at the time everyone was so excited the first woman speaker oh my gosh
3384366 but were on a slow cycle in the publishing world things happen careers blow up thats the tricky part of the business you have to think about not whats hot now but whats hot two years from now
3384367 whether its a movie a new cd release or a book you have a product for sale thats the combination of artistic endeavor and commercial enterprise
3384368 lots of things happen good and bad in this process
3384369 what a lot of readers dont realize is that publishers buy these books off a book proposal not a full manuscript
3384370 thats one reason why scotty mccellans book surprised a lot of people what he proposed to the publisher apparently was tame compared to what we saw on the best seller list
3384371 but this is never an exact or scientific process because of all the variables
3384372 its a tricky business but its immensely satisfying when everything works unfortunately that doesnt happen as often as wed like

3384379 the problem with a living sacrifice is that it can crawl off the altar
3384380 i have never been considered a part of the religious right because i dont believe politics is the most effective way to change the world
3384381 although public service can be a noble profession and i believe it is our responsibility to vote i dont have much faith in government solutions given the track record its why i am a pastor not a politician none of my values have changed from four years ago but my agenda has definitely expanded
3384382 god said you dont care squat about the sick and the poor
3384383 occasional action to keep people alive to teach them the gospel in a credible way

3384386 guys with tears in their eyes a guy was going ill take mozambique and one was going ill take nigeria they were dividing up the world
3384387 use their contacts to draw on resources and attract investment i cant have anything better than this
3384388 i cannot say i am devout but i have a good sense of what faith is about and the usefulness of it
3384389 what saddleback is doing serves the church and serves us too
3384390 warrens people havent done anything for passing on information mobilizing people changing social norms i think the church can be really effective but
3384391 results that tend not to be programmatic they tend to be life change
3384392 we dont sacrifice sustainability for speed if you go back to my very first message in 2003 i said this is going to take 50 years

3384397 is that he gets so many balls going up in the air that one might ask does he have enough hands to catch them
3384398 god has given me the ability to manage my time pretty well
3384399 if i werent doing it id be dead and in my grave
3384400 with global warming and a world thats running out of oil the last thing governments should do is add taxes on something that uses no oil and produces no carbon
3384401 a digital download is the greenest way to buy music movies and software since it requires no driving to the store no delivery vans and no plastics or packaging
3384402 the retail sale lease licensing or use of specified digital products transferred to or accessed by subscribers or consumers
3384403 sales of digital audio works music digital audiovisual works movies music videos tv shows and digital books
3384404 most of the proponents of the nexus legislation would concede that given this is an election year its unlikely the legislation will pass
3384405 golden state retailers would be at a competitive disadvantage to out of state companies

3384407 a series of related images which when shown in succession impart an impression of motion together with accompanying sounds if any
3384408 i suspect we will see the next 14 attempting to address it in the next legislative cycle
3384409 as these technologies meet there is this question of what is digital goods and what is software
3384410 to define where technology is today and how it should be taxed
3384411 provided that the non electronic version of that item was not exempt
3384412 the way our statute is currently we probably could tax them but we should probably have the legislature have the final say
3384413 the sale of digital music delivered electronically to customers for download on their computers constitutes the sale of intangible property and is not subject to sales or use tax
3384414 one of the major benefits of logbook loans is that you can often get access to cash on the same day that you submit your application

3384445 als animationsgestalter bin ich ganz begeistert von der neuen robusten k rperphysik und den rag doll solvern in der version 2009 mit denen ich viele bewegungen einfacher perfektionieren kann die sich sonst nur schwierig realistisch einfangen lie en regisseure werden auch den neuen python script editor und die f higkeit begr en angepasste benutzeroberfl chen zu erstellen mit denen sie motionbuilder in pipelines vollst ndig integrieren k nnen

3384447 it is a struggle achieving a good work life balance while training for the ultimate prize in cp football but aon has been extremely understanding and supportive in terms of the time off from work and allowing me to structure training around working hours
3384448 even some in the government admit that they do not have a clear grasp of what companies are able to do with the wealth of data now available to them
3384449 that is why congress at this point is wanting to gather a lot more information because no one knows that information is incredibly valuable its the new frontier of advertising
3384450 beyond the data question there are issues of how companies should tell browsers that their information is being tracked which area of law covers this and what if anything proper regulation would look like
3384451 several internet and broadband companies have acknowledged using targeted advertising technology without explicitly informing customers
3384452 google in its letter stressed that it did not engage in potentially the most invasive of technologies deep packet inspection which companies such as nebuad have tested with some broadband providers
3384453 alan davidson googles director of public policy and government affairs stated in the letter that users could opt out of a single cookie for both doubleclck and the google content network
3384454 google is slowly embracing a full blown behavioral targeting over its vast network of services and sites
3384455 the f has made some tentative steps toward standards including a december proposal on behavioral advertising practices
3384456 but lydia b parnes the director of the f t c s bureau of consumer protection has said she supports industry self regulation saying that it isnt yet clear that the consumer is being harmed and that regulations might be too specific to current technologies laws have been made on slices of the privacy pie including data about finances or children but complying with various pieces of legislation is difficult companies said
3384457 theres a self regulatory program out there which hasnt been very effective
3384458 it advocates a do not target list and wants the targeting companies to sit down and come up with standard guidelines for how long they keep the information
3384459 yahoo believes most people dont opt out because they actually like targeted ads it is our strong belief that a more customized experience is what users prefer says yahoo vp anne toth
3384460 that may be but what users really want isnt the choice to have a customized experience its the choice over whether their data are collected in the first place in a survey released this spring by
3384461 thats the concern congress wants to address and it explains why more scrutiny is likely to follow
3384462 holes drilled into their skulls and electrode tipped wires connected to their brains might seem like a puzzling corporate strategy
3384463 the fact that these companies are starting to offer installation in a difficult environment could result in a slowdown in share gains or possibly even share loss for best buy
3384464 hes certainly not the best but hes not the worst
3384465 this guys is worth your money let me convince you
3384466 i love the people i work with its like a family
3384467 i was not aware of that rule but i am now its an emergency and i need to do my job
3384468 we are going to have a new eating disorders institute and a new cancer institute because we decided that philanthropy could make it happen
3384469 we definitely see philanthropy as a huge part of the future if we want to maintain and sustain the level of care that we have had
3384470 during my 18 year career in foundation work i have not seen anywhere near as many requests from health care as i have in the past 5 years and from large health care institutions
3384471 everything senator mccain has done has been to widen that gap between the richest and most powerful corporations and small businesses
3384472 working families are looking for a leader who will get our economy moving again and obamas continued clinging to the failed tax and spend policies of the past will do exactly the opposite
3384473 to call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking get him down there and get him to work
3384474 theres no question the selection of tom ridge as john mccains running mate would make our job harder here
3384475 even with tom ridge on the ticket i believe sen obama could and would carry the state

3384480 this analysis was not undermined in any way by politicians
3384481 my people on vulcan have been playing this game for ages
3384482 helped inspire my imagination of what mysteries the universe might in fact hold

3384489 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
3384490 the dup was relentlessly trying to interfere in the uup tory talks and would not be ditching its support and links with the order
3384491 party policy for the rest of the uk has to reflect different situations in other regions unlike northern ireland most parts of gb do not have a selection based post primary system therefore party policy has to reflect different local circumstances
3384492 enceladus has got warmth water and organic chemicals some of the essential building blocks needed for life
3384493 we have quite a recipe for life on our hands but we have yet to find the final ingredient liquid water but enceladus is only whetting our appetites for more
3384494 unfortunately from a republican perspective there are two different jurisdictions and two different economies and two different realities on the island
3384495 the major question historians will ask is not why the republicans surrendered but why they fought such a futile long war
3384496 it has not been unconditional surrender and it has been infinitely better than continuing to fight a futile war for the sake of honouring irelands dead yet producing only more of them but let us not labour under any illusions that the conditions were good
3384497 party leader david ford claimed today that the dup and sinn fein do not want the minister to be a member of the executive meaning he or she would have no role in wider issues like the budget
3384498 so called breakthrough over the department of justice amounts to very little
3384499 apparently all the dup and sinn fein have proposed is a minister who would not even be a member of the executive
3384500 how could anyone fulfil a role as important as justice minister in those circumstances
3384501 should be a runaway winner an eye for detail humour and history i want to be him
3384502 depth variety and regular posts and a bit of politics too
3384503 a brilliant mix of humour politics and insightful analysis not just of ni but of british left politics and beyond where else do you get postings in what i assume is serbo croat beside gail walker watch and the photos attaching to the stories are usually hilarious although a disappointing absence of girls aloud as naughty schoolgirls of late
3384504 for its unusual socialist outlook on northern ireland and wider politics his is the perspective of someone who feels not unreasonably that the present party political system leaves his left wing views unrepresented as such he stands aside from the traditional ni partisan discussions a refreshing interesting and nicely written blog
3384505 is written with a certain amount of linquistic flair this is a blogger who clearly enjoys his english he also enjoys reading and gives us book reviews and cultural pieces his political position is self described as liberal unionist but his views are not entirely predictable and the items rather eclectic including a fascination with and dislike for ethnic nationalism in its east european manifestations
3384506 chekov really has a penchant for writing in a way that really grasps the reader
3384507 i hate to say it but chekov does write well
3384508 passionate unionism epitomising the pan uk unionist approach oneill synthesises an incredible amount of material for this blog a blogger with a genuine grasp of his subject
3384509 for the fact that he is in public office and combines council business and interesting outlooks generally
3384510 but only since pol omuiri came on board since then it has moved beyond a party political platform to something more considered and interesting
3384511 a group blog fairly closely associated with an identifiable political party is quite a good thing as it provides a picture of that partys id as well as a space for them to develop their thinking about issues that they will sometimes have to answer for their stance on soonish
3384512 a wee part of the blogosphere where i can be found and i shamelessly do so because it will permit me to state that the blog in question has been nominated four times in political blog categories and lost four times
3384513 i agree with its tone and attitude regarding the north of ireland situation
3384514 ignited has a grasp of the nuts and bolts of politics which i envy reading his pieces always make me view my own stuff as a bit conceptual and airy fairy a blog which is in touch with the unionist grass roots
3384515 fair deal is one of the very few bloggers delivering a dup standpoint in a thoughtful manner i rarely agree with what he says but hes always worth reading damian oloan is an excellent new addition writing coherent and temperate analysis from a liberal nationalist perspective an encouraging indication that moderation is not dead
3384516 fair deal damian oloan tom griffin patrick corrigan and very occasionally ian parsley all are delivering thoughtful and coherent articles analysing different areas of political life here
3384517 almost intimidating erudition from brian crowe as he examines the world from communitarian conservative perspective

3384523 david vance really out posts the other contributors and hes from the north though id say that his focus is a good deal wider but his stuff on ni is quite astute
3384524 zoals hij er nu instaat is het ajax en anders niets

3384527 maar wij zien geen andere uitweg de communicatie met ajax ligt sinds maandag stil destijds is er ook niet over een oplossing gesproken de enige boodschap was kenneth moet naar de beloften

3384540 die aufgabe der 60er jahre bestand darin sich die besten werte die in zwei jahrhunderten liberaler kultur zum ausdruck kommen anzueignen dies sind in der tat werte die selbst wenn sie nicht innerhalb der kirche gereift sind dort in deren sicht der welt gereinigt und korrigiert ihren platz finden k nnen das ist verwirklicht
3384541 die kirche ist nicht die katholische kirche sie besteht in ihr subsistit in mag man auch behaupten sie bestehe nur in ihr so ist doch festzustellen dass man damit ein wirken des hl geistes und dieser kirche christi au erhalb der katholischen kirche behauptet
3384542 die k rzliche klarstellung der glaubenskongregation bez glich des wortes subsistit ist in dieser beziehung sehr erhellend es wird dort behauptet die kirche k nne keine neuheiten lehren dabei lehrt jedoch diese klarstellung die auf dem konzil eingef hrte neuheit

3384631 party policy for the rest of the uk has to reflect different situations in other regions unlike northern ireland most parts of gb do not have a selection based post primary system therefore party policy has to reflect different local circumstances
3384632 enceladus has got warmth water and organic chemicals some of the essential building blocks needed for life
3384633 we have quite a recipe for life on our hands but we have yet to find the final ingredient liquid water but enceladus is only whetting our appetites for more
3384634 unfortunately from a republican perspective there are two different jurisdictions and two different economies and two different realities on the island
3384635 the major question historians will ask is not why the republicans surrendered but why they fought such a futile long war
3384636 it has not been unconditional surrender and it has been infinitely better than continuing to fight a futile war for the sake of honouring irelands dead yet producing only more of them but let us not labour under any illusions that the conditions were good
3384637 party leader david ford claimed today that the dup and sinn fein do not want the minister to be a member of the executive meaning he or she would have no role in wider issues like the budget
3384638 so called breakthrough over the department of justice amounts to very little
3384639 apparently all the dup and sinn fein have proposed is a minister who would not even be a member of the executive
3384640 how could anyone fulfil a role as important as justice minister in those circumstances
3384641 should be a runaway winner an eye for detail humour and history i want to be him
3384642 depth variety and regular posts and a bit of politics too
3384643 a brilliant mix of humour politics and insightful analysis not just of ni but of british left politics and beyond where else do you get postings in what i assume is serbo croat beside gail walker watch and the photos attaching to the stories are usually hilarious although a disappointing absence of girls aloud as naughty schoolgirls of late
3384644 for its unusual socialist outlook on northern ireland and wider politics his is the perspective of someone who feels not unreasonably that the present party political system leaves his left wing views unrepresented as such he stands aside from the traditional ni partisan discussions a refreshing interesting and nicely written blog
3384645 is written with a certain amount of linquistic flair this is a blogger who clearly enjoys his english he also enjoys reading and gives us book reviews and cultural pieces his political position is self described as liberal unionist but his views are not entirely predictable and the items rather eclectic including a fascination with and dislike for ethnic nationalism in its east european manifestations
3384646 chekov really has a penchant for writing in a way that really grasps the reader
3384647 i hate to say it but chekov does write well
3384648 passionate unionism epitomising the pan uk unionist approach oneill synthesises an incredible amount of material for this blog a blogger with a genuine grasp of his subject
3384649 for the fact that he is in public office and combines council business and interesting outlooks generally
3384650 but only since pol omuiri came on board since then it has moved beyond a party political platform to something more considered and interesting
3384651 a group blog fairly closely associated with an identifiable political party is quite a good thing as it provides a picture of that partys id as well as a space for them to develop their thinking about issues that they will sometimes have to answer for their stance on soonish
3384652 a wee part of the blogosphere where i can be found and i shamelessly do so because it will permit me to state that the blog in question has been nominated four times in political blog categories and lost four times
3384653 i agree with its tone and attitude regarding the north of ireland situation
3384654 ignited has a grasp of the nuts and bolts of politics which i envy reading his pieces always make me view my own stuff as a bit conceptual and airy fairy a blog which is in touch with the unionist grass roots
3384655 fair deal is one of the very few bloggers delivering a dup standpoint in a thoughtful manner i rarely agree with what he says but hes always worth reading damian oloan is an excellent new addition writing coherent and temperate analysis from a liberal nationalist perspective an encouraging indication that moderation is not dead
3384656 fair deal damian oloan tom griffin patrick corrigan and very occasionally ian parsley all are delivering thoughtful and coherent articles analysing different areas of political life here
3384657 almost intimidating erudition from brian crowe as he examines the world from communitarian conservative perspective
3384658 where language literature and politics intersect some thoughtful musings on identity in relation to northern ireland from an irish ex pat
3384659 a tyrone ex pats whimsical blog where politics is viewed through the filters of sport travel identity and more recently fiction
3384660 a new collaborative venture by a number of bloggers braodly on the left it deals in political social and cultural issues as well as some humour
3384661 possibly the most impressive blog there are serious and thoughtful pieces virtually every day on a huge range of topics
3384662 serving up an interesting mix of investigative journalism and local interest
3384663 david vance really out posts the other contributors and hes from the north though id say that his focus is a good deal wider but his stuff on ni is quite astute
3384664 its just another stepping stone another thing you got to get through whatever what can you say
3384665 what are you looking for in a vice presidential running mate
3384666 someone who shares my priorities and values priorities are really important
3384667 i know gov ridges name comes up but we just dont talk about any names
3384668 our struggle for complete independence from india will continue no power on earth can deter us from achieving this
3384669 however a decision in the matter can be taken only through mutual arrangements between india and pakistan

3384672 i still dont think weve played anywhere close to our best basketball
3384673 the surgery of dede is not perfect but the results meet what we hoped or expected
3384674 he was believed to be among the top leadership of al qaeda
3384675 there are many foreign elements there more than local militants
3384676 its one more important person gone it will have an impact
3384677 al qaeda is the main machine behind the insurgency in afghanistan and pakistan the taliban the chechens and the uzbeks are used as foot soldiers as cannon fodder but the actual machine is al qaeda
3384678 it kind of goes without saying this is a pretty big day for us
3384679 there are four beautiful little daughters all eating cake playing with each other and its very surreal its hard to believe this is the life i somehow wandered into
3384680 the university of calgary faculty of environmental design donated a table they made especially designed to feed the four babies each of the girls has their own spot and theyre actually finger feeding themselves now
3384681 we started with toenail polish and then we got brave and we let that wear off
3384682 its always been colours autumn was autumn colours red yellow brown orange brooke is water colours so blue or green and calissa is pink and dahlia is purple
3384683 autumn is just a smiley happy little girl brooke is the most laid back calissa is absolutely the busiest of the girls if theres trouble shes causing it or on her way to it dahlia is very independent
3384684 we dont want to raise our kids as a collective quad
3384685 simon is amazing in himself he is so sweet and gentle hes their favourite person definitely their favourite person
3384686 i do remember very clearly when they pulled out autumn and youre so worried and you dont know whats going to happen and they pulled her out and she let out this great big cry and i just remember thinking shes going to be ok shes crying shes crying
3384687 and then brooke calissa and dahlia and then i was out and i was always worried they were going to pull out a fifth

3384690 was ich an der linkspartei respektiere ist ihre sehr intens
3384691 as a naive 14 year old in sydney an under pressure 18 year old in athens and i guess a relieved 23 year old here
3384692 my whole life worth was based on winning a gold medal
3384693 whether i won a gold medal or finished last didnt matter
3384694 i may have looked composed on the outside on the inside i was shaking like a leaf i was tearing up behind the dais
3384695 they see me swim for two minutes in a race and they see my reaction they havent seen the four years of hard work behind it the blood sweat and tears and fighting to stay positive most days
3384696 it was very very difficult to be thrust into the limelight
3384697 i mean what next then im glad i went through the silvers and the bronzes
3384698 im a pretty quiet reserved person everyone has a comment that im pretty blase but i just do what comes naturally thats me
3384699 it picked him up so to speak and the car was left back at the crossing
3384700 i guess you could say he had an angel looking out for him
3384701 we intended to carry out door to door mobilisations of voters
3384702 even during the campaign we must still respect the principles that the police have to be notified to hold rallies those activists had not
3384703 theres nothing i could have done more or better or focused more or anything thats all i had today and thats the way it goes
3384704 i think i have it in me if i want to if i enjoy it ill carry on well see how things go but it would be disappointing to finish like that
3384705 you work for two years for it and to produce that is very disappointing but i know that i did everything in my power to get there
3384706 to be honest for the last year my form hasnt been where i wanted it to be and i tried everything i threw everything at it i moved away from home to try to focus more but it seems the harder you try the slower you go
3384707 i had three or four years where i was doing everything i wanted to do and i was on top but sometimes its just not there as much as you try i wish i had answers
3384708 i think ive got a lot to offer people if they want to hear it and my door is always open i can see myself doing that and thats the plan with my academy in centurion to give something back after four olympics maybe five
3384709 it was more than two seconds off my best time so im really happy with that maybe it was all the people watching that made me swim fast i couldnt really go out there and embarrass myself
3384710 but my coach and i have been working really hard and obviously the hard work is starting to pay off
3384711 i tried to take it out quite hard because people have been taking it out quite fast here so i didnt want to fall behind
3384712 the second 100 i just tried to hold it i did get a bit tired in the second 100 but i managed to hold on at least obviously im really happy it was a close race there between neil and i its going to be another close race tomorrow wednesday again
3384713 the atmosphere is incredible theres no way you can swim slowly in this place
3384714 after the first 100 i turned and saw everyone there and knew the race was on and i had to push that third 50 pretty hard so it was good im not really worried about swimming a semi in the morning the problem is just trying to get this lactic acid out of me tonight trying to get a good nights rest and hopefully come back a little faster
3384715 were trying to get an assessment of exactly what it means what a halt means and whether its taken place of course
3384716 i dont think im going to get into the position of blame
3384717 regardless the point is at this point is that the parties should pull back
3384718 since august 6 our view is certainly and certainly the view of europe and the g7 and a host of other nations is that the escalation on the part of russia was disproportionate to their stated intentions
3384719 im not aware of any of those kinds of specific requests
3384720 we are already providing some humanitarian assistance and were reviewing our options for doing more once the shooting stops
3384721 you know lunatics difference from other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them so you have to use surgery
3384722 as for claims by the georgian president that the ceasefire has been observed for two days thats a lie georgian forces continued to fire at peacekeepers unfortunately people were killed yesterday there was no ceasefire from the georgian side
3384723 it is our clear position and this position is strengthened after the russian violations that it was a big mistake made by allies that georgia and ukraine did not get the membership action plan in bucharest
3384724 we think russia got this message as a green light and mostly the recent steps we have in the territory of georgia come from this mistake
3384725 i definitely think its a good idea for the treatment of the common cold if it works and only time will tell as far as that is concerned
3384726 for it to be effective it would have to be taken very quickly at the first signs of infection or contact with someone with a cold
3384727 you never really know why somebody wants to be around you or if they do genuinely like you
3384728 i wish everyone had a label on their forehead so you could automatically tell their intentions sometimes you just wish that no one wanted anything from you
3384729 we were both small town people doing very big things and we relied on each other dealing with fame
3384730 i dont know the phone will ring and itll be him and ill maybe not answer
3384731 i dont want to name names even though he probably deserves it but he fooled around
3384732 oh yeah and lied it was one of those things that everyone knew but me he was a good liar nobody would come out and tell me and he seemed perfect in every way
3384733 im sure weve all run into these people whether theyre friends boyfriends or girlfriends
3384734 i dont know the phone will ring and itll be him and ill maybe not answer
3384735 i dont know the phone will ring and itll be him and ill maybe not answer
3384736 im not going to be able to go on like this you cant just
3384737 be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity
3384738 the biggest problem we have is the troika that has been set up to tear hillary down
3384739 lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people its not a republican movement or a democratic movement but a broad based movement centered on the idea that america is ready for change
3384740 this effort may bankrupt the campaign and provide little if any political advantage
3384741 are we going to tell everyone out there the truth about who voted for what when or are we going to selectively tell people
3384742 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3384743 given the lack of polling information for post 5 feb states these projections are based on best estimates
3384744 when the house is on fire its better to have a psychotic fireman than no fireman at all
3384745 that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong
3384746 we have begun but must now in earnest show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3384747 preempts obamas reiteration on march 5th that they are still up 100 plus delegates and that we cant win
3384748 we cannot secure enough delegates to win we cannot overtake him the math simply doesnt work it is imperative that we provide a clear and tenable answer to the single most important question we face
3384749 but senator clinton has given howard wolfson both the responsibility and the authority to make final decisions about how this campaign delivers its message

3384762 i had two really good service games as she did and one double fault gives her break point then all of a sudden im 5 2 down in about two minutes and then the match is over in about another two
3384763 i mean its hard i dont really feel as though i played badly i made one mistake basically at that point of time and then couldnt get it back obviously against top players you cant afford to make one mistake but its not very often where you just absolutely get blown off the court like 20 minutes later

3384774 nigel feels he has done everything he can in the nrl and would like to pursue his options in french rugby japan also remains an option
3384775 weve sat down and talked with nigel every step of the way over the last few months about his future nigel has had a lot of problems with injuries this season and he has been undecided about what he wants to do
3384776 if he decides to retire we will try to get him a position with the club working with the clubs polynesian players its up to nigel to make a decision
3384777 we were flooded and are absolutely furious with mid suffolk district council we pay our rates and called the council for help and they just told us to come up and get sandbags from their depot rather than delivering
3384778 my son had to take time off work from his employers who were brilliant to collect them for us the council must have known there was a bad weather warning and just left us i am not happy about this at all

3384849 that early in the game id rather punt it or get another play dialed up rather than have him take a shot he doesnt need to take hopefully he can do that
3384850 you can be smarter when you get forced out of the pocket lappano said
3384851 youve got to know when to get down i think when hes on the sidelines now youll see him opt to get out of bounds rather than stick his foot on the ground and go back inside and take somebody on which is what happened against oregon state
3384852 wevve got to make them pay when they bring pressure he said the average pac 10 team brings pressure 22 23 percent of the time
3384853 are crawling all over the line of scrimmage crawling all over the place and that creates some problems
3384854 weve got to be at the top of our game to know where all those guys are lappano said a few sacks by cal on blitzes saturday were mostly the result of blocking errors by the backs something that will have to get fixed this week as well
3384855 really important heading into the future with johnson a contender for the starting job next season with
3384856 he was giving all the right vibes in that game
3384857 influenced it a little bit too you cant stay the same all the time lappano said he liked the look of it lamenting that one reverse to
3384858 if you get too emotional it can hurt you he said
3384859 i was there five years so i know what this game is about he said
3384860 im sticking to what they want me to do at this point in time weve had a lot of mismatches with jon brockman in the post so weve really wanted to exploit them so until im needed as a scorer id much rather have my teammates score
3384861 when my teammates need me to score ill do it but in terms of trying to come out and score 20 every night if my team doesnt need it then whatever it takes to win thats what ill do
3384862 uw is just more offensive orientated but i think they play defense hard just like wazzu
3384863 the greatest plays and we named three as well as including a
3384864 the snow bowl when an underdog cougar team beat a uw squad that had been ranked no
3384865 a lot better than i was feeling a week ago
3384866 im confident because im confident going into every game said uw defensive tackle
3384867 i think it will be a little bit tense in that room i dont have any desire to meet with those guys before the game because i dont think theyre going to like us too much after the game
3384868 its dangerous for him to come out not only for us but for himself
3384869 there are so many people out there who dislike him its safer for him to stay in jail
3384870 asher knows what hes doing i need to look at those guys so i dont need to get asher a bunch of reps
3384871 right now until i can feel comfortable with someone else being able to field kicks and thats the first thing youve got to be able to do ashers the guy
3384872 kicking in sanford stadium is definitely a treat kicking on the practice fields is nice but when you get in that stadium and you feel that thats the coolest thing going
3384873 i have confidence that he thinks im the guy for it and i think i will be the guy for it
3384874 but as far as making his decision publicly i dont know if hell even do that or just give me the nod before the game
3384875 there are creepy crawlies in there and apparently they got real dangerous centipedes you think its gonna be a fun video game but real centipedes if they bite you its like getting shot with a bullet its that painful you can try to control the jungle but no one could clear all the centipedes the nooks and crannies where they hide are impossible to find
3384876 on the very first day of shooting i was carrying the biggest gun and i had to be running shooting diving with the gun and i landed funny on the gun and i heard something pop i bruised my rib and you know how that goes if you get a rib bruise it lasts for about six weeks of not being able to breathe all the way in its such a drag
3384877 the offenders are targeting single mothers and widows who are seeking new partners for long term relationships and marriage
3384878 it is a cruel and deliberate offence feeding on someones dreams of a happy ending
3384879 uk police forces do not have any jurisdiction to investigate crimes that originate within nigeria on this basis there is no prospect of prosecuting the offenders of this type of criminality
3384880 our best efforts are to disrupt their criminal networks and alert the public as a crime prevention measure
3384881 i would always recommend that anyone engaged in an online relationship confide in a person they can trust for an impartial view on the development of that relationship
3384882 online fraud does not seem to be a top priority

3384885 weve gone to eight or nine cubs games this year
3384886 shell call a squeeze play or a slider she knows their entire pitching repertoire
3384887 we need to be cautious with what were allowing someone to do and at what point in their recovery theyre allowed to do it
3384888 to keep the brain stimulated but not enough to push it into overdrive
3384889 whether its pop warner football or soccer or high school teams
3384890 it kind of goes without saying this is a pretty big day for us
3384891 there are four beautiful little daughters all eating cake playing with each other and its very surreal its hard to believe this is the life i somehow wandered into
3384892 the university of calgary faculty of environmental design donated a table they made especially designed to feed the four babies each of the girls has their own spot and theyre actually finger feeding themselves now
3384893 we started with toenail polish and then we got brave and we let that wear off
3384894 its always been colours autumn was autumn colours red yellow brown orange brooke is water colours so blue or green and calissa is pink and dahlia is purple
3384895 autumn is just a smiley happy little girl brooke is the most laid back calissa is absolutely the busiest of the girls if theres trouble shes causing it or on her way to it dahlia is very independent
3384896 we dont want to raise our kids as a collective quad
3384897 simon is amazing in himself he is so sweet and gentle hes their favourite person definitely their favourite person
3384898 i do remember very clearly when they pulled out autumn and youre so worried and you dont know whats going to happen and they pulled her out and she let out this great big cry and i just remember thinking shes going to be ok shes crying shes crying
3384899 and then brooke calissa and dahlia and then i was out and i was always worried they were going to pull out a fifth

3384905 having a wonderful time at millennium park wish you were here
3384906 if the stolen product were to be reintroduced into distribution channels the companies cannot guarantee that products were stored at appropriate temperatures nor can the companies guarantee the products were not damaged
3384907 a voluntary withdrawal of products with lot numbers corresponding to that of the stolen product minimizes the possibility of inadvertent use of stolen product by physicians and therefore the overall risk to patients
3384908 when directly questioned many clinicians find it inconceivable that their own error rate could be as high as the literature demonstrates
3384909 they acknowledge that diagnostic error exists but believe the rate is very low and that any errors are made by others who are less skillful or less careful
3384910 with the hard cases doctors generally seek out different opinions or turn to computer based decision support tools
3384911 i determined from that matrix that i didnt have cancer
3384912 i said at the time that if i survived i was going to see what i could do to help other people
3384913 the old tools used by physicians individual idiosyncratic systems to track patients reliance on human memory and patient adherence to or initiating of follow up appointments are too unreliable to be depended upon to ensure high quality in modern diagnosis
3384914 the patient can play a valuable role in combating errors related to latent flaws in our healthcare systems and practices
3384915 if your doctor says you should be better in a week and you arent call the office and let them know
3384916 is it possible that i may have more than one problem
3384917 after everything i went through i am still very high on doctors
3384918 they are very dedicated people who work very hard and go through hell when they find out they have made a mistake the problem is they dont normally find out
3384919 there is no evidence for a pharmacokinetic or clinically relevant interaction between these two drugs
3384920 the alleged adverse interaction claimed by some based on case reports is clearly not confirmed
3384921 the australasian leukaemia and lymphoma group allg mm6 trial thalidomide prednisolone zometa versus prednisolone zometa that is presently submitted for publication showed no difference whatsoever in the incidence of renal adverse events between the two arms
3384922 it is clear that our foods have contained this compound since man started cooking with fire
3384923 in the future we hope to look at many more cancer types
3384924 we also hope that other researchers will do similar studies to expand on our research
3384925 they went looking for an association in this study and they found one
3384926 the exposures in the animal studies were the equivalent of about 300 times the amount that a typical person would consume
3384927 balance moderation and variety are the keys to a healthful lifestyle
3384928 in cancer younger age frequently is associated with better outcome with the exception of breast cancer where patients below age 35 do much worse
3384929 however the very high 10 year survival rate of 44 in patients aged 40 or younger after stem cell transplantation was surprising
3384930 even before the introduction of the novel drugs bortezomib and lenalidomide an improvement in survival was obtained in conventionally treated patients in the enrollment period 1992 2002 as compared to earlier enrollment periods
3384931 this seems partly due to the introduction of thalidomide better supportive care higher usage of transplantation and stage migration at diagnosis
3384932 lower iss stage is the most important prognostic factor when a series of clinical parameters are evaluated
3384933 transplantation proved to be superior in patients of all age groups eligible for transplantation compared to those treated with conventional therapy
3384934 autologous stem cell transplantation should be used in patients who are eligible for this procedure
3384935 there is a real risk of blood clots with the use of lenalidomide in myeloma
3384936 should take into account all the risks and benefits by using a low dose of steroids and using aspirin as a preventive measure the risk of blood clots can be minimized to less than 10
3384937 this is a good example of cooperation between the professional sector and government to get to the truth
3384938 we were surprised by the impact of pet on patients with a pre pet intended management of biopsy
3384939 this is no small feat and reflects the power of medicare data when used for this type of focused clinical trial
3384940 there is also no certainty that the management proposed is correct
3384941 still on the basis of the strong message from this study and cmss role in planning
3384942 it seems likely that the indications for pet in oncology will be broader in the future in this way this study is an important step in the long process of establishing clinical acceptance and insurance reimbursement for pet as a routine diagnostic imaging modality
3384943 continuing these requirements could prevent many patients from receiving optimal care for their cancer resulting in increased morbidity and mortality
3384944 the decision to use fdg pet for oncologic imaging should be left to treating physicians working in consultation with imaging specialists and with their patients
3384945 although original reports had actually suggested the potential opposite procarcinogenic effects of statins
3384946 this is the first study to suggest a dose response effect of lipophilic statins on cancer occurrence
3384947 future studies should provide additional evidence allowing the assessment of long term effects of statins on cancer risk

3384957 there are several iron and steel forestry mines and power industries in the state an innovative approach should be adopted to reduce carbon dioxide
3384958 developed countries like japan canada and australia have emitted enough greenhouse gases to cause global warming now to neutralise this affect green development mechanism should be adopted

3385101 this is an extremely rare case of co infection in a controlled monogamous relationship which showed us how a strong immune system in the elite suppressor kept the virus from replicating and infecting other cells
3385102 our findings offer hope to vaccine researchers because they reveal that the immune systems primary offense known as cd8 killer t cells can effectively halt disease progression by a pathogenic form of hiv
3385103 moreover the strength of the immune response was not dependent on infection by a weakened form of the virus and if we can harness the means by which these elite white blood cells stop the virus then we can hopefully teach or reprogram white blood cells in others to also target hiv
3385104 the presence of this genetic spot is a discordant result that strongly contradicts theories that various genetic factors alone play a protective role in suppression
3385105 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack hiv and how a stronger immune response can force hiv into a permanent defensive state

3385151 the first thing that seriously caught my attention when i got the silhouette guitar was that unique snapping quality that every note seems to have when played on this instrument
3385152 it gives it an almost 3 d effect that makes it a pleasure to record with because theres very little need for eqing in order to make it stand out in the mix then theres the playability factor its built for speed and comfort a very addictive guitar
3385153 continuing in the same tradition as in the name of bach im doing a vivaldi album its my personal homage to the composer who represents the city of venice to the world my fellow venetian antonio vivaldi im choosing excerpts from the four seasons to some more obscure pieces two musicians from venice meet across the centuries
3385154 something ive wanted to do for a long time a heavily groove oriented electronica that features massive amounts of orgiastic guitars im not afraid to venture into the world of dance music i like the idea of electronic sleaze shred
3385155 is a rock album based on more traditional instrumentation but no less daring in terms of envelopes being pushed and clich s thrown out the window hendrix cream zeppelin etc but with a 21st century twist

3385157 he has tremendous work ethic and loves the game of football
3385158 that makes him excel not only does he have athletic ability he has that something extra you need to be a great pro hes very athletic has his nose to the ball is active and makes plays
3385159 i have to thank my teammates and coaches for putting me in position to make plays
3385160 i always come to practice like its my last day ive always had adversity throughout my career
3385161 its more important that i prove myself right and not other people wrong
3385162 he has the athletic ability and heart he makes up for his lack of size by putting his face on somebody

3385165 this election is not about democrats or republicans its an election about picking the best man
3385166 during his tenure plant closings and job losses hit linden especially hard
3385167 since 1884 weve had a roll call vote its a nominating convention not a coronation
3385168 i dont think theres any harm in nominating sen clinton at the convention
3385169 it will acknowledge the success we had and it will give an opportunity for people to express themselves and get behind obama and win in november
3385170 its a simple thing to do and its the biggest sign of party unity
3385171 if we do that one thing the hillary people can get past it and move on
3385172 if the situation were reversed the obama people would feel the same
3385173 for the first time in a generation its been a close election and this was such a unique situation
3385174 sen clinton is going to do everything she can to make sure sen obama is the next president and that will include how the convention is handled and the role she plays
3385175 polls out there show that older women are the potential swing demographic in this election
3385176 it helps obama and the party to have her play a prominent role in the convention
3385177 if a candidates got delegates then both names can be placed in nomination
3385178 are these folks so new to politics are they so arrogant that they think hes different from every other nominee weve ever had
3385179 were democrats were precinct captains were fundraisers were the kind of democrats obama will need to win in november
3385180 if she releases us for the sake of party unity fine
3385181 but she hasnt done that the campaigns are talking and i respect they need to come to an agreement that makes both sides happy
3385182 it has nothing to with real life nothing to do with justice its politics and politicians

3385252 ergo the russians are using their a team as expected
3385253 the russians have gone to great lengths to try and implicate the ukraine in the russian air force losses even going as far as to suggest that an sa 5 sold to the georgians by the ukraine was responsible for the backfire loss
3385254 thats clearly not the case but shows the russian attempt to bring the ukraine into the periphery of this event by implication and to attempt to explain how one of their premier long range attack assets could have been shot down so easily
3385255 the russian press has been making lots of noise about the buk and tor systems and i would say that the buk is the most likely culprit for all of these aircraft losses
3385256 if so it points out a major flaw in the russian plan not gaining and maintaining pure air superiority and dominance over the battlespace by taking out the georgian air defenses and air defense network before they went into the conflict
3385257 it appears that the russians underestimated the georgian air defense abilities in this conflict and have paid the price
3385258 they even killed female goats because their private parts were not covered and their tails were pointed upward which they said was haram
3385259 they regarded the cucumber as male and tomato as female women were not allowed to buy cucumbers only men

3385278 though i should die with you yet will i not deny you
3385279 couldnt you watch with me for an hour watch and pray so you dont enter into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak
3385280 go therefore and make disciples of all the nations teaching them to observe all things that i have commanded you
3385281 the dying the cripple the mental the unwanted the unloved they are jesus in disguise
3385282 though i should die with you yet will i not deny you
3385283 couldnt you watch with me for an hour watch and pray so you dont enter into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak
3385284 go therefore and make disciples of all the nations teaching them to observe all things that i have commanded you

3385286 let us make man in our own imge after our own likeness
3385287 name is a minor and is unable to sign for himself
3385288 we need more troops more helicopters better intelligence gathering and more nonmilitary assistance to accomplish the mission there
3385289 what makes obama attractive to me is that he understands that we live in a very different world where we have to relate to a variety of cultures and peoples
3385290 a new brain for barack obama its 78 years old ed note its 80 years old and it still works perfectly it belongs to zbigniew brzezinski the peppery ex national security adviser to jimmy carter
3385291 they operate not by arguing but by slandering vilifying demonising they very promptly wheel out anti semitism there is an element of paranoia in this inclination to view any serious attempt at a compromised peace as somehow directed against israel
3385292 wanna walk with me do ya wanna walk with me
3385293 bob quit trying to figure me out and just follow me
3385294 as scripture says i shall destroy the wisdom of the wise and bring to nothing all the learning of the learned where are the philosophers now where are the scribes where are any of our thinkers today do you see now how god has shown up the foolishness of human wisdom if it was gods wisdom that human wisdom should not know god it was because god wanted to save those who have faith through the foolishness of the message that we preach
3385295 therefore we teach not in the way in which philosophy is taught but in the way that the spirit teaches us we teach spiritual things spiritually an unspiritual person is one who does not accept anything of the spirit of god he sees it all as nonsense it is beyond his understanding because it can only be understood by means of the spirit

3385298 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
3385299 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
3385300 im looking forward to coming back and working there some more soon
3385301 sydney has some of the most wonderful film crews in the world and ive worked all over the world
3385302 ive always referred to sydney as the most un foreign foreign place ive been to its very much like san francisco lucass home town
3385303 its going to take a while because its really hard to do
3385304 because photorealistic is what live action movies are animation is art
3385305 test run for the live action series im working on
3385306 im trying to take star wars which was a us50 million an hour adventure and do it for us2 million an hour
3385307 its hard to do that and have them look the same
3385308 these days lucas sounds like a museum curator fussing with dusty memorabilia
3385309 its time he challenged himself if he has any inspiration left he shouldnt waste it on exploiting something old when he could put it to use dreaming up something new
3385310 i thought it would be small but its fun for adults and kids its fun for every age
3385311 you must go to disneyland you have to see it because of all the movies its typical america
3385312 you know what you have here its a nimitz class aircraft carrier 101 000 tonnes 85 planes and one of these in good condition mind will go for oh id say 5 billion how did you ever leave it on the mantle for so long
3385313 weve been acclimatizing to the altitude everyone is in good spirits and weve certainly confirmed that the race will be very very hard
3385314 the tour of utah is one that we can realistically win
3385315 we not only have a team of good climbers but a group of guys who perform very well at high altitude and those two things dont always go hand in hand
3385316 they have been kind of teasing that ive been director for the camp but obviously theres a lot more to being a team director than picking a few routes
3385317 seriously though i have been so excited for this camp and the race that i have been planning for months what i want to show the guys it is very motivating to have a race of this calibre in your own backyard
3385318 this is really more about acclimating than hard core training
3385319 the people at the place where we have been staying have taken great care of us so now all we have to do is worry about riding our bikes
3385320 i think the guys will see the benefit of having really done our homework
3385321 im pretty optimistic about utah it is a stage race where we should be able to perform very well
3385322 the courses are charismatic enough to make a real difference
3385323 there are some really big hard stages during the event and on a sporting level the race will be extremely interesting and difficult
3385324 the 2006 race was really a breakout race for both of them it was the first time they demonstrated themselves on a national stage and showed that even as 8 guys in a van they could put in really solid performances
3385325 the race in 2006 was pretty special for me as i was trying very hard to get a pro contract
3385326 this year will be different since i will race hard and focus on whats best for the team but the riding in utah really suits me so im excited
3385327 but i can t even tell you because your mind is closed look at your reaction you don t want to learn you just want to confront me i said no i want to learn
3385328 okay go ahead and buy the perfect straight edge spend two three four hundred dollars find something that is super straight and make a super straight ten twelve foot level with an accessory like a sliding square that rides along it so you know that your tiles are perfectly level and square because you need both in order to have a quick easy and fast job
3385329 why should i tell you if you re not going to listen anyway and called me stupid
3385330 is to make the process of building things better easier faster and safer
3385331 wood is alive inside and depending on how you cut it there can be forces inside which cause the wood to react if you bind the blade or if the material is improperly supported the wood can be thrown back at you at very high speed causing a nasty injury
3385332 the most important thing when cutting wood is that you have to support the material if the material is not supported things can go wrong this system ensures the wood is properly supported so you get a clean perfect cut every time
3385333 when you connect two pieces together they self align perfectly because of the unique design of the connectors and the guide rails
3385334 i wouldnt have let you do it if i wasnt sure it was totally safe
3385335 with this system youd really have to be trying to make a mistake for it to go wrong
3385336 normally you would need at least a 40 tooth blade to get this kind of edge
3385337 they dont want you using their products with a makita or a hitachi they want you to buy everything from them
3385338 you dont have to buy lots of things from us
3385339 you buy only what you need the system is expandable you can start by buying only a few small pieces later if you decide you want more you can buy more and it will work together with what you already have but it is up to you
3385340 in europe everybody makes a guide system it s been established for many years
3385341 and the european manufacturers are also in the business of making table saws and miter saws so when you make all these tools the guide system that you re making is just an add on you don t want your 300 guide system to eliminate the need for your 6 000 table saw not when you have the sales but for us at eurekazone the guide system is the entire game
3385342 we have a free upgrade policy because that s how people know they re not gonna get something that s gonna be outdated
3385343 if we make a tool better than the one that you bought last year or two years ago and you like our new tool better send your old tool back and we ll give you the new one for free just pay the shipping
3385344 we keep our customers happy they know they re gonna have the latest design theyll never have to pay for it again because we changed the design of a product
3385345 youre pushing wood into a rotating blade its kind of crazy if you think about it the dead wood concept is much much safer
3385346 we have the absolute best customer service in the business
3385347 i put my personal cell phone number in the instructions if customers have a problem they can call me anytime 24 hours a day and ill help them work it out
3385348 one of the most successful in its 17 year history
3385349 well capitalised businesses that initiate and produce a portfolio of projects over time
3385350 develop world class and market ready scripts and game concepts
3385351 there is broad consensus among victorian stakeholders that the industry is generating too few world class scripts and game concepts and producing too many film and television projects with sub par scripts that needed further development
3385352 i came in with a primary goal of having fun and just seeing how i stack up against the other women after all boulder is the triathlon capital of the country so i knew that the competition here would probably be my toughest all year i just wanted to get out there and race hard and i am thrilled that i earned such a solid result in the process my favourite part was the bike there were sections when i was flying along on my blue t14 at 70 kilometers an hour tucked into my aero bars it was a blast
3385353 our strong financial performance and belief in continued earnings growth were key drivers in making this recommendation i am pleased that this proposal has been approved by the board as it allows us to follow through on our commitment to return value to our shareholders
3385354 remember ibm has always prided itself on its marketing prowess and market segmentation was an essential part of that the last thing ibm wanted to do was compete with itself but it looks like that kind of thinking isnt going to work anymore

3385364 the major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at or repair
3385365 a common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools
3385366 every day in the news were hearing about the effects of the credit crunch and ways we can try to save money on household expenditure
3385367 a recent report highlighted that we throw away approximately a third of the food we buy and this trial alone has shown that on average households are throwing away around 4kg of good food per week
3385368 so perhaps that will give people food for thought next time theyre filling up their shopping trolley
3385369 its fraught with animal welfare concerns and it does not bring back a loved one
3385370 a dead animals dna does not guarantee the offspring will be identical to the deceased it takes more than just genes to create an animal
3385371 we dont need new sources to compete with animal shelters and reputable breeders

3385384 to tell the truth its not something really on our radar at all
3385385 theres always speculation about a lot of things that happen in motorsport i think the speculation about toyota in v8 supercars is a good example of that we only hear about that when we pick up the magazines and read about it
3385386 we dont really look at it in the context that its something we may or may not do i guess its hard to ignore that as a category its the biggest show in town and its definitely a world class series but for us its just not really something on our radar

3385427 till that the issue of tawang is settled whatever else we may do it is difficult to say we have crossed the rubicon
3385428 when they the chinese talk in terms of movement forward they keep arguing tawang has always been a part of tibet which is a matter of debate
3385429 tawang is an area with substantial settled populations not a small number it flies in the face of guiding principles and political parameters for china to demand it how we work out whether i have the ingenuity or mr dai bingguo the chinese special representative has the flexibility we will see

3385436 saakashvili the great democrat is busy charging anyone who opposes him with being a pawn of the russians and therefore guilty of treason but the west is calling on him to restore civil liberties and in an apparent effort to propitiate his western benefactors he has lifted new elections widespread and growing opposition to his strong arm tactics even among many of his former supporters spells political trouble for saakashvili and his corrupt cohorts however and an appeal to georgian ultra nationalism which was always the real ideological motivation of the rose revolutionaries would bolster him in the polls and provide a much needed distraction at least from the ruling partys point of view

3385445 i think there has been regional divide for a long time people have been raising their voices to separate there are people who want the state to be separated the recent unfortunate happenings on the issue of amarnath shrine board has triggered out of basic problem
3385446 there is nothing that cannot be solved through dialogue but the issue should not be politicised let people from both the sides talk
3385447 my feeling is that we have to dampen the fire rather than raising it i would sacrifice myself anytime rather than see innocent people being sacrificed
3385448 the board was made for better management of yatra and is governed by good people the bigger complaint is that all them should be local but i believe majority should be locals but you should have people from outside also

3385470 ive never been so excited since i started playing handball
3385471 i admit we are not still not as good as the european teams what we have to do is show our best in every coming match
3385472 its very hard for european teams to play korea because we dont play them too often they are very very fast very good at movements and attacks
3385473 i missed several chances but im still telling myself i will get more chances
3385474 maybe it is a bit of bad luck but i believe i will score a goal playing at home i will show everybody a strong han duan
3385475 although han failed to score argentina coach jose carlos borrello said she made the difference in the match
3385476 she has good movement good vision and an eye for the game
3385477 its a totally different team if shes not on the field
3385478 i knew they were going to give him everything he wanted
3385479 ive been watching the scoring here the first four days and i knew it was bad so i was expecting it i think they were giving him a score for anything and i had to work to get all of my points
3385480 british coach terry edwards echoed his fighters complaints calling the scores
3385481 i thought they were very generous to the chinese you expect a slight bias but you come to the olympic games and expect a level playing field
3385482 joe didnt box the best ive seen him but the scoring makes a difference and the tactics had to be changed because of the scoring everything the chinese guy touched they pressed the button for him

3385485 some things you just dont ever want to say so i wont but it was just weird the way the scoring was
3385486 its very stunning and the thing were going to try to keep letting our guys know is youve got to try to keep it out of the hands of the judges thats a hard thing to do
3385487 going up that early in the game was just an awesome start for us
3385488 that was a killer goal to concede against a team with the quality of the u s
3385489 the u s was looking to face brazil in the next round if it had lost setting up a rematch of the olympic final from four years ago in athens the brazilians won group f with a 3 1 win against nigeria earlier tuesday in beijing
3385490 this win says a lot about the character of the players on this team
3385491 we just want to keep getting better in each game and that was important today
3385492 the americans were coming of a 1 0 win over japan on saturday and a 2 0 loss to norway in the opener last wednesday
3385493 i think its amazing the fact that we bounced back from that start

3385504 away from the pool phelps is a creature of habit he struggles to wake up in the morning and loves to take naps in the middle of the afternoon
3385505 i dont think michael will let his guard down until the last relay race
3385506 i dont think he has a comfort zone at all until the whole meet is over the whole olympic games he will not let his guard down because theres always someone out there
3385507 no on this planet it would appear he likely got over the toughest hurdle when the 4x100 free relay team anchored by jason lezak pulled off an astonishing comeback over the last 25 meters to beat the french by a fingertip
3385508 theyve been resting all week and just gearing themselves up for one race where every time michael gets up on the block he has to gear himself up for his performance that night or that morning
3385509 as long as its inevitable you might as well lie back and enjoy it
3385510 i think definitely by new years eve ill be ready to go
3385511 spring 09 is only a rough estimate an injury sustained on new years eve could delay his return to affliction even further
3385512 it just seems the hand doesnt really sustain the strength of the strike

3385515 but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and is not just a hoax on them
3385516 john mccain believes roe v wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned and as president he will nominate judges who understand that courts should not be in the business of legislating from the bench
3385517 because i know what it is like to live without human rights where human life is accorded no inherent value
3385518 mccains advisers have said that he will not fight to soften the republican platform on abortion and mccain himself has said that it would be
3385519 samedi lors des essais chronos je nai pas fait de bons temps
3385520 can you imagine being 22 and having your parents know everything about you
3385521 literally my mom can go on the internet and find out where i went last night who i was with i mean there are no secrets
3385522 it was a huge compliment to be asked to do that
3385523 the biggest challenge is to continually push yourself to do things in a more efficient manner
3385524 if you dont meet the thresholds that are required then there are penalties or reduction in payment because of that
3385525 its something we need to look at as we continue to maintain the roads and the conditions theyre in
3385526 i know i suck as a translator i am learning la
3385527 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
3385528 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
3385529 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
3385530 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
3385531 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
3385532 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
3385533 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
3385534 she would replace the cabins at camp david with cabanas and topless would be optional for all world leaders which would be horrifying but very european
3385535 yes i am pressing the letter f and the number 8
3385536 sir do you see the f keys running across the top of your keyboard
3385537 when i went on a trip here i loved the campus and i thought it was probably the best for my academics and athletics combined
3385538 their attitude and work ethic the way they treated the aspect of team we felt would fit in perfectly with what we were trying to do because of their work ethic and determination they have seen great time drops and are competing at the highest levels of the big ten
3385539 i didnt know him as well before he got to iowa but we swam together for a couple of summers before he came here since then we have become really good friends at our club i am always training with him and some of the other guys in the summer it is really nice to have them there to keep pushing me and it makes me try to keep up with them even though it can be hard
3385540 they are both exceptional leaders and athletes for our team
3385541 they have shown a tireless work ethic and determination and i have seen great time drops they are both leaders by example quiet hardworking determined and very matter of fact which i like as a coach both of them have similar characteristics and ironically they come from the same club back home
3385542 we have high expectations for all of the athletes our program is in a phase of still being a young team and in a rebuilding process it is going to take a little more than talent it is going to take some patience and determination conor will really lead the team to not only competing at the highest levels of the big ten but also the country he has aspirations of competing at a higher level
3385543 i like to compete against any big ten team in general
3385544 i probably like playing wisconsin the most because my dad went there i get really pumped up for the big ten championships with all of the conference schools being there it comes down to the end of the season it is a long season so you are just excited to be there and ready to swim fast
3385545 conor is only going to be a sophomore and he achieved a provisional time in just his freshman year with tremendous time drops
3385546 she is not one of those really strict swimmer parents she is pretty laid back she taught me how to swim and never really critiques my swimming which is nice she has always been there for me
3385547 our program is in a phase of still being a young team and in a rebuilding process it is going to take a little more than talent it is going to take some patience and determination conor will really lead the team to not only competing at the highest levels of the big ten but also the country he has aspirations of competing at a higher level
3385548 it feels good to know that he coach long is confident in my swimming ability
3385549 hopefully next season i can help lead the team in a move up in the big ten standings

3385555 whose suffering and courage in a hanoi prison camp is an american legend
3385556 the democratic party in its quest for power has managed a propaganda campaign with subliminal messages creating a god like figure in a man who falls short in every way
3385557 it seems to me that if mr obama wins the presidential election then messrs farrakhan wright ayers and pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralise this country and help create a socialist america
3385558 i was caught up in the hysteria during the vietnam era which was brought about through marxist propaganda underlying the so called peace movement
3385559 the radicals of that era were successful in giving the communists power to bring forth the killing fields and slaughter 2 5 million people in cambodia and south vietnam did they stop the war or did they bring the war to those innocent people in the end they turned their backs on all the horror and suffering they helped create and walked away
3385560 if mr obama had his way he would have pulled our troops from iraq years ago and initiated an unprecedented bloodbath turning over that country to the barbarianism of our enemies
3385561 there is not a cell in my body that can accept the idea that mr obama can keep us safe from the terrorists around the world and from iran which is making great strides toward getting the atomic bomb
3385562 if god forbid we live to see mr obama president we will live through a socialist era that america has not seen before and our country will be weakened in every way
3385563 its only natural that industry based obama supporters will henceforth regard him askance
3385564 reading voights op ed piece these many years later i realise how right he was
3385565 its out of line to insinuate that we should blacklist people for speaking their minds
3385566 its a strange thing when people in this country cant express their opinions without being attacked
3385567 slept with too many women done too many drugs and been to too many parties
3385568 history is filled with men who would be gods but only one god who would be man
3385569 america is just a much much younger civilization you couldnt find a better version in america of the pantheon of ancient greece than superheroes
3385570 there is still a longing for mythos for a spiritual pantheon and in an era where we have enshrined materialism to such a degree and we have killed off every conceit that seems to be weak and based on religion new age all those types of things the only sort of acceptable mythology i think is superhero mythology
3385571 that is a christian concept rather myths about heroes were accepted as valid narratives about moral truths that helped explain life
3385572 one error is what cost me a medal but i was really fortunate to come this far
3385573 i cant complain ive been riding my luck to get just through each heat to the final
3385574 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3385575 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3385576 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3385577 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3385578 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3385579 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3385580 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3385581 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3385582 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3385583 this is sickening to treat other human beings like that is simply appalling i hope action is taken to remove this sign immediately we must never see anything like this again
3385584 landlords should play a positive role in helping migrants feel welcome in the area instead of playing into the hands of racists
3385585 this despicable matter is unrepresentative of a community which is making significant progress migrants play a massively positive role in our community they bring cultural diversity to northern ireland and they contribute greatly to our economy
3385586 medically unexplained symptoms can be related to any body system and most medical specialties
3385587 more than a quarter of primary care patients in england have unexplained chronic pain irritable bowel syndrome or chronic fatigue
3385588 and around a third of new neurological outpatients have symptoms thought by neurologists to be not at all or only somewhat explained by disease
3385589 in many these symptoms can be made worse by worries about school friendships or family
3385590 patients can have relatively severe diseases such as heart attacks yet adapt well and refuse to give up their work thus they have disease with little illness
3385591 the hydraulics failed they were about to land then all these alarms went off because the hydraulics had failed on one side of the plane they had to fly all the way back to zurich with the landing gear extended and land there it was a very rough landing and it became chaos after that
3385592 all of my books are really romances typically love triangles
3385593 i was driving home in the middle of the night after having been to my fathers house in the mountains i began to imagine the story of someone probably a travelling salesman who had to travel a great deal periodically when he felt overwhelmed by the circumstances of his life he would park his car by the side of the road leave the headlights on walk a few paces in front of the car and then lie down as if he was the victim of an accident or a heart attack or a crime
3385594 he could have this enormous cathartic emotional outburst in their arms people would console him and tell him that everything was going to be all right that is what the story choke started as me in the dirt
3385595 the contrast between what i would have thought of this person had i seen him on the street and who he really was was so shocking it made me look at people in a different way and realise that seemingly the most boring person may have the most fascinating inner life
3385596 i have no idea what to say to people i have no idea how to be with people
3385597 so many author events can be boring and pretentious i really dont want those kids to be bored it is worth the effort to make the events crazy so that its more likely they will come back
3385598 my private history in terms of people in my life who are dead is very easy to discuss i dont feel those people can be threatened or intruded upon now but i am enormously protective of the people who are currently in my life my existing friends and family that is where the curtain is drawn
3385599 its about doing everything youve been taught to do as a child and then realising you dont know what to do next and also realising that those nice things youve been taught to do are only going to get you so far and unless you do something differently youre going to be that disappointed child for the rest of your life
3385600 were looking at ways to create it with uncooked carrots so we can keep the live enzymes if we can were on to a winner
3385601 the heat affects the omega 3 so we only roast half of the seeds
3385602 vitamin c is interesting because it can donate an electron without becoming a free radical itself
3385603 were doing something called three dimensional cuisine which is about presentation flavour and nutrition the nutrition is the interesting part because there are plenty of chefs looking at presentation and flavour but not nutrition were doing healthy food to a michelin starred standard
3385604 we know that 40 per cent of zinc in beef is available so how can we enhance it we know we can help the absorption of zinc with vitamin a so we put it with liver which is high in retinol a more readily available source of vitamin a we also put it with watercress which is high in iron and combine it with orange zest the vitamin c of which helps with absorption of the iron the next thing to investigate is does the vitamin c prohibit the absorption of the zinc in the beef or work against the vitamin a
3385605 the most exciting bit is using the research to help other people
3385606 40 per cent of cancers can be prevented through food but only 2 per cent of research is done in this area
3385607 of michelin starred recipes without the nasties associated with good food
3385608 within two weeks i was back at work and the doctor was surprised at how well id healed up
3385609 some people say but i like to indulge when i go out but thats the whole point you can indulge without it being bad for you if we can do an clair and cr me br l e with no cream and 75 per cent less sugar and it tastes exactly the same why not have that instead
3385610 research from america says there are about 50 per cent more nutrients in broccoli shoots than in a whole head of broccoli weight for weight you can buy sprouters from health shops and sprout your own broccoli shoots flax and sunflower seeds then add to salads for texture
3385611 we cook most of our vegetables in their own juices particularly carrots and fennel to keep in nutrients and enhance flavour cooking them in water means the vitamins leach out buy more vegetables than you require juice 25 per cent and cook the rest in a little of the juice
3385612 you can buy cocoa butter which is non dairy on the internet and use instead of butter
3385613 this method ends up with a beautifully cooked fish retaining we believe as many nutrients as possible first set the oven to 50c and once its heated check with a thermometer cook for around 12 minutes depending on cooker if white protein leaks out of the fish the oven is too hot if it hasnt started to cook its too low you should be able to press the fish so it parts along the zigzag line at 50c most of the omega 3 should still be in the fish
3385614 we use glutamate rich food such as tomatoes to give a feeling of wanting more our tomato essence is perfect with quinoa which is packed with antioxidants roughly chop tomatoes onions garlic and basil plus seasoning then blend for 10 seconds so its still rough place a clean wet cloth napkin over a bowl pour in pur e and hang in fridge so liquid drips through cloth into bowl the liquid should be straw coloured and transparent but with a great tomato taste use it to cook quinoa as if youre doing a risotto finish with seeds and nuts
3385615 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganised
3385616 the senate is currently conducting an internal investigation in an attempt to discover who is behind this once we learn their identity that information will be turned over to law enforcement and we would expect it to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law
3385617 good friends are hard to find harder to leave and impossible to forget
3385618 as finance director of the virginia gop karl rove lived in richmond during the mid 1970s but he didnt learn much about our city
3385619 how else do you explain the political hatchet mans patronizing comments about richmond during an attempt to denigrate gov timothy m kaine the former richmond mayor who is being considered for barack obamas running mate
3385620 in belittling richmonds size rove shows hes out of touch
3385621 it appears that karl rove will swiftboat anyone including cities
3385622 richmond has more in culture history and business than all those cities cited by rove put together and so perhaps mr rove would like to come see how terrific a place this is the capital city of virginia rather than just taking shots on a news show
3385623 cynical and misguided viewpoint out of touch with america and the real people with real problems who reside there
3385624 freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one

3385630 george bush and big oil special interests killed this responsible drilling bill because they werent satisfied with their record profits
3385631 if mr massa is serious about disagreeing with speaker pelosi maybe he should put his money where his mouth is and return the 14 000 in campaign contributions hes received from pelosi
3385632 otherwise his statement is just deceptive hypocritical and highlights everything thats wrong with the democratic majority thats leading congress the bottom line is a vote for eric massa is a vote for speaker nancy pelosi and the do nothing drill nothing democratic led congress
3385633 only speaker nancy pelosi can set the agenda for the u s house of representatives and speaker pelosi has made it clear she wont allow a vote on a comprehensive energy plan that includes drilling
3385634 its one of the limitations on his powers he cannot establish the agenda and the agenda is set by the majority party which brings it all right back to the speaker

3385694 since virtually no one at hothead had worked on adventure games before it was like the blind leading the blind with no one having intuition about how the current story translated into game length this was one of the factors that led us to work with lucasarts adventure game veteran ron gilbert
3385695 a final issue was managing who was in charge of certain decisions as we progressed it became clear that the dividing line between their responsibilities and hotheads was blurry
3385696 for example the nonlinear dialogue trees in the game are all script jerry wrote every word but finding your way through the dialogue is gameplay and the type of information that gets revealed reiterated or emphasized during each dialogue encounter is key to making a solid adventure game and to ensuring that the player is always aware of what she or he needs to be doing

3385735 standing in the shadows understanding and overcoming depression in black men
3385736 so it shouldnt come as much of a surprise that the overwhelming number of victims and perpetrators of violence are black men

3385749 it is a lesson to us all that captains are not necessarily born they can be made
3385750 kevin pietersen might not be the best captain in the world in the next few months but he can learn to become a great captain just as michael vaughan did vaughan got better and better with each game
3385751 it always seemed vaughan and fletcher were still close and certainly closer than vaughan and moores that is understandable but now there is a chance for pietersen and moores to create a bond
3385752 one thing he pietersen will definitely bring is his absolute professionalism he pushes himself hard in all aspects of practice and preparation and if he can create that environment for the rest of the team then he should be successful
3385753 if you re willing to drive around 200 miles along dirt roads and find something that s definitely crumbled you re definitely part of the breed

3385771 the draft rules also would bar federal agencies from assessing the emissions from projects that contribute to global warming and its effect on species and habitats
3385772 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3385773 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3385774 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act

3385806 we are trying to get an assessment of what a halt means and whether it is taking place of course
3385807 president saakashvili is the duly elected president of a sovereign democratic nation and so the determination of him as president is his decision and a decision for the georgian people and not for any outside nation to make demands on whether he is the appropriate person

3385857 a british rate cut within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3385858 the largest upward pressure in july came from food and non alcoholic beverages where prices rose this year but fell a year ago
3385859 within this division there were large upward effects from meat bread and cereals and vegetables
3385860 this is a really disturbing set of data that will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3385861 the rise in consumer price inflation to a series high of 4 4 percent in july was well above expectations

3385956 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3385957 conventional oceanographic platforms cannot provide observations under the sea ice particularly on the antarctic continental shelf where the most important water mass transformations take place until now our ability to represent the high latitude oceans and sea ice in oceanographic and climate models has suffered as a result
3385958 by providing ocean measurements under the sea ice the seals are helping us to establish the global ocean observing system we need to detect and understand changes in the ocean
3385959 apart from australia and japan my samples were small and confined to young middle class urbanites nevertheless this study is unusual because it covers so many nations and the comparisons offer some interesting food for thought
3385960 overall the results show that young men and women are divided on the issues of sharing housework and a womans right to have an abortion it should come as no surprise that young women are more in favour of domestic democracy than the young men while also being more supportive of a womans right to have an abortion
3385961 it is interesting to note that those in western countries tend to see sharing housework and role reversal as similar ideas whereas most of those from asian countries who are also supportive of sharing housework were quite opposed to role reversal while this might indicate to some people that greater equality exists in the western countries another interpretation is that it demonstrates the greater commitment to the fathers bread winning role in the asian countries
3385962 while performing housework and childcare was seen as nothing short of emasculation for many of the young men in my study this does not prevent them from claiming their rights in relation to abortion decisions
3385963 the chinese people surveyed were the most accepting of a womans right to have an abortion with both males and females seeing this as her decision in some cases the chinese responses asserted that both parents had responsibilities in relation to the child but it was the womans right alone to choose an abortion
3385964 the beijing police are either so incompetent that they would let her disappear under their nose or that they must be responsible for taking her away how can a young woman with an infant child sabotage the olympics while under such heavy and round the clock police presence

3385975 were just waiting for the proof of busters age his birth certificate a passport is only proof of nationality and a naturalisation certificate is likewise most of that is self certification

3386070 t he u s dollars recent rise is largely attributable to market expectations of a bottom in u s short term interest rates coupled with a diminishing likelihood of further ecb tightening
3386071 we are going to look back with a similar bemusement at the pound trading at 2 10 and the euro above 1 60 and the australian dollar near parity with the u s dollar

3386073 they have attacks that let them load chosen content to a chosen location with chosen permissions thats completely game over

3386076 this stuff just takes a knife to a large part of the security mesh microsoft built into vista
3386077 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks this is a real tour de force

3386096 this is an extremely rare case of co infection in a controlled monogamous relationship which showed us how a strong immune system in the elite suppressor kept the virus from replicating and infecting other cells
3386097 our findings offer hope to vaccine researchers because they reveal that the immune systems primary offense known as cd8 killer t cells can effectively halt disease progression by a pathogenic form of hiv
3386098 moreover the strength of the immune response was not dependent on infection by a weakened form of the virus and if we can harness the means by which these elite white blood cells stop the virus then we can hopefully teach or reprogram white blood cells in others to also target hiv
3386099 the presence of this genetic spot is a discordant result that strongly contradicts theories that various genetic factors alone play a protective role in suppression
3386100 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack hiv and how a stronger immune response can force hiv into a permanent defensive state

3386621 we have been holding special discount season sales under saste se sasta cheaper than the cheapest and mahabachat offers during the january 26 and august 15 period since past three years this year also our mahabachat offer is held between august 13 to 17 at all our big bazaar brand showrooms across the country
3386622 we expect a similar good response this year when we first started with the scheme in 2005 there were 21 big bazaar stores in the country while now we have 96
3386623 although we have been giving special independence day discounts earlier also this is the first year when we have gone for an extended week offer for the week after august 15
3386624 the past year has been one of worry due to rising inflation and we want to re assure the consumers during this special period
3386625 we have foot falls of on average 3 5 lakh in our stores during a weekend we are hoping to have 50 per cent more than average during the extended independence day week of special offer
3386626 each year we have our special autumn sales period and this time we might continue it for another week after august 15 the scheme include discounts of up to 40 per cent in apparel and 50 per cent in footwear

3386629 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3386630 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3386631 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3386632 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3386633 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3386634 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3386635 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life

3386637 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
3386638 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
3386639 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
3386640 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3386641 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
3386642 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
3386643 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death

3386652 most classes are 50 minutes long two to three times a day
3386653 the rest of the time youre navigating the college community my advice to students is to realize the least amount of time you spend in college is in the classroom
3386654 he thinks he could do it without going to the center but he really does need them

3386671 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3386672 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3386673 is also still as great as ever with a factor of 2 at both high and low latitudes
3386674 because we have not had recent climate changes of the magnitude forecast for the rest of this century
3386675 we can have greater confidence in the multi model mean changes than in that of any individual model for climate change assessments
3386676 it is doubtful that averaging different formulations together will end up giving the right result
3386677 model responses e g tropical land precipitation can often be of different signs and there can be little confidence that averaging them together will produce a better result
3386678 at this point we cannot determine the low and high latitude sensitivities and we have no real way of obtaining them our italics
3386679 affect the confidence we can have in many of our projections of atmospheric dynamic and hydrologic responses to global warming
3386680 forecasting even the large scale response to climate change is not easy given the current uncertainties
3386681 regional responses may be the end result of varying influences in part due to warming in different tropical and high latitude regions
3386682 real progress will be the result of continued and newer observations along with modeling improvements based on these observations
3386683 there is no guarantee that these issues will be resolved before a substantial global warming impact is upon us
3386684 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins

3386687 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3386688 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3386689 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3386690 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3386691 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3386692 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3386693 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades

3386698 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3386699 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3386700 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3386701 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3386702 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3386703 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3386704 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states

3386711 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3386712 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason

3386719 as a black man in america i can never deny that race matters but i believe race is the red herring in this campaign folks have gone too far and are too sensitive
3386720 we should all agree that race is a part of this campaign once we acknowledge the elephant in the room perhaps we can start to figure out how to draw the line

3386742 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3386743 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition

3386746 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3386747 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3386748 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3386749 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3386750 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3386751 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3386752 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3386753 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3386754 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3386755 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore

3386757 im having a belvedere in your honour the mountains are fantastic fabulous colours in the high desert will say hi at pasquals for you
3386758 i know there is a little mini panic going on in the ranks of not a few democrats and the chattering classes but with o in hawaii the nation on vacation the tv full of the olympics phelps romping in the pool and georgia on my mind i just want to say hey its august chill
3386759 the unreal is the paris britney obama glam rock nonsense the latest example of which is
3386760 the more team mccain does this as much as it obviously gets their ya yas out the more they demean their candidate
3386761 this country faces immense issues and it is not a time for insipid parodies and you know what the american people understand it and they want more from the men who are asking for their vote to be president of the united states so the mccain frat boys can act out as much as they want
3386762 the unreal is thinking that obama has peaked in the high 40s in virtually all the polls but not understanding that it is mccain who may have peaked in the low 40s where he has been stuck in virtually all the polls
3386763 what is real is race the industrial states and commander in chief
3386764 this election brings us into new territory the country has never gone through this before
3386765 you ask americans where georgia is and they think it is somewhere near atlanta
3386766 so the handwringers are wailing that we are only slightly up in august but guess what we are up in august and we will still peak in late october

3386820 this is a grave challenge to the united states and europe
3386821 the united states and its nato allies must together impose a price on russia

3386828 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3386829 we do not trust saakashvili because he has not repented for the war crimes committed by him against our citizens in south ossetia
3386830 the us have given a lot of money and equipment to saakashvili to train the georgian army although we had expressed concerns that he could use it inside the country however washington assured us that it will not happen in the past they americans have been stopping saakashvili at our request when he was on the verge of this but this time for some reasons they could not control him

3386840 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3386841 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3386842 about 25 percent of the u s corporations not paying corporate taxes were considered large corporations meaning they had at least 250 million in assets or 50 million in receipts

3386847 it was a bad crisis for the world it required tough words but also a smart approach to call on the international community to step in and im very very happy that the senators obama request for a ceasefire has been complied with by president medvedev

3386849 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
3386850 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap

3386855 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050
3386856 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3386857 these are the kinds of things you see in e mails that you see circulating about obama in this sort of subterranean smear campaign against him you never see these things voiced by the candidates
3386858 had sen clinton followed mark penns advice it would have caused her more angst than good
3386859 whats going on right now is that a lot of obama supporters and fundraisers are trying very hard to retire sen clintons debt one reason theyve had difficulty doing so is the dislike among obama people for mark penn specifically
3386860 they tend to blame him for the nature of these negative attacks
3386861 couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution
3386862 this was a historic campaign people thought it would be an easy march to the nomination and then an easy win in the fall and instead weve had this historic presidential election where shes collapsed and a first term senator has won the democratic nomination
3386863 so i think its just the nature of the defeat has made a lot of people frustrated and theres certainly people out there who really want the kind of full story to come to light so people can understand exactly what happened
3386864 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from specific decisions she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
3386865 her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency
3386866 clintons top advisers never agreed on the answer over the course of the campaign they split into competing factions that drifted in and out of clintons favor but always seemed to work at cross purposes and clinton herself could never quite decide who was right

3386886 i will look for them after i take you home mom
3386887 promise me that you will call me instead of wandering out in the night she continued to peer out into the blackness as he led her into the house she could fall into the lake or hurt herself running over here or who knows what else
3386888 it looks like a cute house not spooky at all
3386889 can we take kyla and kevin down to the lake
3386890 i prefer intuitive but yes i am a psychic real job too
3386891 well i cant wait to take you over to uncle bobs moms house dagneys to see what you think the kids think it is haunted
3386892 it definitely has a strange feel to it down there
3386893 aunt kathy would it be ok if charlie and i came back to the farmhouse later tonight without the kids
3386894 i was skeptical do i think the house is haunted i dont know but i definitely can you give you some of my impressions first that picture in the living room gives me the creeps and there is something in the basement that was bothering me is there a room that is blocked off down there
3386895 is in the closet in the first bedroom upstairs i sensed that a young girl was taken advantage of against her will
3386896 the other strange feeling that i got was when we passed the orchard i know that kevin also was picking up on something do you happen to know why i felt a presence there
3386897 the original farmhouse stood in front of that orchard i believe that there had been a fire in the late 1800s that burned it to the ground and the house you were just at was built in its place
3386898 i was looking at the pictures that i took at the farmhouse
3386899 someone is definitely trying to make us aware of their presence
3386900 i am having a hard time breathing all of a sudden
3386901 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me
3386902 every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3386903 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3386904 i think i play one of my best matches in the last weeks on hard court
3386905 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3386906 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3386907 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3386908 i played really clean matches in the past the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more i just want to keep playing the same consistency
3386909 i felt like any time that i needed to serve well i did if i was down love 30 or a 30 all point
3386910 thats good for me going on in the later rounds that im tough on my serve
3386911 they told me we succeeded we are the world champions i told them we reached our target
3386912 other teams were good but we were better we performed perfect today everyone was excellent
3386913 it bothers me a lot especially if people from home kind of put down our team saying count the u
3386914 i wish more people in the u s believed in us like we believed in us now i hope more people realize the u s is a force to be reckoned with
3386915 since athens the chinese team has run into a lot of failures which tested the team
3386916 i know them and they do work very hard and put a lot of hard work in their training we worked as team we enjoyed it and thats more important than anything
3386917 we always believed in ourselves and we kept at it tenacious
3386918 and our guys knocked it out of the park it was just amazing
3386919 the logical conclusion is to destroy the military capacity of georgia
3386920 in particular the people who left south ossetia they often left with nothing but what they were wearing
3386921 peoples most urgent needs are shelter and clothing and some of them also need food assistance
3386922 we were evacuated three days ago and weve been here since then
3386923 in one village i saw some people who were still leaving on foot carrying plastic bags with whatever they could carry even bringing their cows with them
3386924 i saw men cutting hay in an area which the night before was right in the middle of the firing
3386925 this is what we faced in moscow that they would try to export this to us that we should prepare for this situation and very quickly strengthen our political system
3386926 i am timi and tickled pink to be designing for by design
3386927 despite the russian presidents claims earlier this morning that military operations against georgia have been suspended at this moment russian fighter jets are bombarding two georgian villages outside south ossetia
3386928 we will need more evidence everyone in this situation needs a signed binding agreement
3386929 until that happens we are mobilised we are prepared for everything
3386930 i do appreciate it medvedevs gesture but there has been more damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties today
3386931 it could be that the executive order hasnt trickled down to the rank and file or it could mean something else

3386938 i am not buying the lie that sacrificing the arctic national wildlife refuge and americas coastal waters to oil drilling would make a real difference in gas prices either today or twenty years from today

3386966 there is no way to justify the text in the text area and this probably wont be in a future revision text parsing is already very slow for even relatively short areas and adding features there will make it really slow the main problem here is the native device fonts which are required for i18n in text areas and are just remarkably slow we will need charwidths to be of very fast performance to support something like that and the calculations for this sort of feature would be rather complex

3386973 noticed a bug with combobox it only occurs when the combobox should be a big list so when box is selected the opened box height should be bigger then the screen is the last component on the screen and when selected box opens at the top of the actual combo box and then notice the starting element in the box is off the screen some where at the top and the last element is at the top of actual box so its missing scrolling functionality and looks like the rendering y position is calculated as openboxy actualboxy openboxheight sum of height of all the elements in the combobox so openboxy being negative value when openboxheight is greater then actualboxy
3386974 what bothers me is the worker and its fields are created on the edt doinbackground on some other thread has access to the fields then done is back on the edt accesing the same fields so this isnt really thread safe i should either have thread safe collections add synchronised accessors or make them atomics or have that complicated return object not boolean which is pointless in this example alternately is it possibly ok to access those fields after the future get in the done method shouldnt their values be visible by then

3387000 thats the view at the moment that people moving back understand exotic products but it will percolate to the local sector and people will learn these things and there wont be any need to drag investment bankers from new york or london
3387001 when you see the hustle on the streets of lagos all those traders selling all those products you know the street works
3387002 you formalize distribution in nigeria today its a billion dollar business because everybody needs distribution everybodys got products
3387003 you get up in the morning and you see all of lagos on the move young boys trying to make ends meet its an eye opener

3387009 it was important for our clients to have a simple installation process combined with the ability to share fingerprints across multiple computers
3387010 our users have been asking for an easy reliable way to track which employees are booking appointments and transactions and a method to eliminate buddy punching or one employee clocking in for another m2sys provided a turnkey fingerprint software solution that drastically simplified the integration process and they offered the bulk pricing that we needed to make this new technology affordable for our millennium tm clients the m2sys fingerprint biometrics solution will bring accountability and reliable logging to millennium tm customers
3387011 our goal at m2sys is to offer our integrator partners the shortest and simplest path to biometric software adoption
3387012 industry leaders like harms software arent interested in allocating the significant development resources that are typically required with a low level fingerprint sdk integrating bio plugin tm will help harms software to rapidly bring a robust fingerprint recognition system to the spa and salon industry

3387027 its the best tribute we can do but its going to seem weird to walk out on stage

3387029 he had great timing and this strange energy in his eyes
3387030 were excited to announce the new milestone release 3 mr3 of the phoneme feature project as you know phoneme feature is a live code base which is being continuously evolved by the efforts of community members as well as suns engineering teams it forms the basis of suns commercial product known as the sun java wireless client 2 1
3387031 it may seem strange to start a series of articles about rest systems and the restful design approach with such a low level issue as binding

3387036 to recap for others with similar problems having a properties file in the jre lib ext directory causes problems compiling jsps because the app server tries to treat the properties file as a jar file to use as the class path to compile jsps

3387040 javafx cannot be used to write multi threaded applications at least for now instead there are going to be some classes to do the most common tasks which need to be done in another thread there will be specific classes for specific tasks for example remotetextdocument allows to load a text document asynchronously afaik the whole async package is still under development and the fact that abstractasyncoperation is public is probably a bug
3387041 jsr 179 is not available in any of the phoneme svn repositories i found an implementation in one of the zip files you can download from the phoneme download page https phoneme dev java net downloads page html phoneme feature mr2 rel src b23 08 may 2007 zip what i did was copy around some configuration files so i could build the jsr sources again however as there are currently no wince location providers i had to use the stubs implementation see src common native stubs that is why you are getting this message
3387042 youll probably see a set of bugs rfes being filed and fixed over the next few months related to reducing the warning messages in the openjdk builds as the warnings get fixed we also may want to dial up the warnings found with compiler options that ask for more warning diagnostics we could even include the use of tools like pscan and findbugs but thats beyond the scope of this hunt
3387043 sometime ago the new connection between glassfish and osgi was announced you will be able to extend the upcoming glassfish v3 via osgi bundles though v3 isnt final yet one can already get acquainted with it and already with its osgi extensibility the information on the practical steps of extending glassfish via osgi is currently not centralized so here is a quick start describing the absolute basics from which one can extrapolate more meaningful scenarios
3387044 because garbage collection gc is one of the largest sources of unpredictability in java applications a real time virtual machine vm must find a way to prevent collection pauses from causing tasks to miss their deadlines there are several different approaches to scheduling gc within a real time environment each with benefits and weaknesses these include work based and time based incremental collection approaches which are aimed at minimizing the effect of gc on scheduling

3387056 journalism is the art of learning in the public eye
3387057 if the more you learn about something fewer people will talk to you youre getting closer to the truth
3387058 there is no such thing as true objectivity in journalism only the act of approaching a subject with an open mind

3387061 as the single biggest source of cumulative anthropogenic co2 emissions expansion of the coal industry is unacceptable in the face of impending climate chaos mining giants such as bhp are undermining collective action on climate change
3387062 the actions of corporations like bhp clearly illustrate that the responsibility for climate change cannot simply be laid at the doors of china and india if we are serious about fighting climate change we have to tackle the root causes and those are greed and a committment to relentless economic growth
3387063 the issue of energy and how we will we provide power for homes businesses transportation has gone from a back burner issue to a front burner issue thank goodness
3387064 there is no doubt that the science shows that climate change is happening
3387065 we shouldnt be absent at the table as the federal framework is being hammered out

3387068 there are four regional governors associations right now and each of them have a regional climate initiative except the south
3387069 the national governors association made an attempt this year to do some significant things and found it to be very difficult
3387070 the difference between democrats and republicans may pale in comparison to the differences between energy producing and consuming states
3387071 what governor kaine is doing is a very smart approach to this thing which is to ease along a little bit here to try and find if there are some places where we can find some common ground
3387072 i think everybody is committed to a practical approach and all the pragmatic strategies that help improve the environment but also secure a prosperous future for people in all of our states
3387073 it is amazing how a creature so fragile can achieve such immeasurable superiority

3387076 at current trends the world will fall short of the millennium sanitation target by more than 700 million people
3387077 hopes of a breakthrough in the global sanitation and water crisis at the g8 summit were dashed as the g8 delivered a communique largely devoid of concrete actions to help the 2 6 billion people lacking access to a safe toilet and the 1 1 billion people lacking access to clean water
3387078 instead of agreeing an action plan to tackle what a recent wateraid report claims kills more children than any other single factor g8 leaders were content to report on progress at the 2009 summit and take steps to implement the discredited 2003 g8 evian water action plan
3387079 proposals included in earlier communique drafts for an annual meeting and review to drive progress had been removed while the g8 failed to provide any specific financial commitments
3387080 in 1998 the inter american development bank idb awarded 54 million in loans to the haitian government to improve the countrys patchwork crumbling public water system the money was intended to bring clean water to people who for many years had been denied this basic human right with devastating consequences for public health ten years later however this desperately needed money has not produced a single improvement to haitis water supply in the city designated to be one of the first recipients
3387081 w ch nan soley the denial of the right to water in haiti
3387082 reveals the united states governments clandestine efforts to ensure that political considerations namely the desire to destabilize haitis elected government at that time led by president jean bertrand aristide took precedence over the rights of some of the planets poorest and most vulnerable people
3387083 in the 10 years since the loans were approved the haitian water system has actually gotten worse in 2002 a water poverty index released by the british based centre for ecology and hydrology ranked haiti dead last out of 147 countries surveyed
3387084 worked for six years to bring the story of the idb loans to light during that time haitis water system continued to deteriorate the report states that public water systems are rarely available throughout the year and close to 70 percent of the population lacks direct access to potable water at all times the percentage of the population without access to safe drinking water has increased by at least seven percent from 1990 to 2005 infectious diarrhea was the second leading cause of death in haiti in 1999 and gastrointestinal infection was the leading cause of mortality for young children these preventable diseases result primarily from unsafe drinking water and poor sanitation
3387085 millions of people in bangladesh continue to drink water from arsenic contaminated tube wells the most common source of drinking water in the country according to health specialists a 2001 survey by the british geological survey estimated that more than 50 million people in bangladesh drank water from such wells that figure is closer to 100 million now says mohammad quamaruzzaman of dhaka community hospital
3387086 the only way to test so many wells in such a short time is through field testing kits
3387087 water use efficiency is by 2 3 times higher than in conventional systems therefore much more people can be serviced by the same amount of water energy need is by 100 000 kwh per year lower solar energy is used instead of fossil fuels therefore no connection to centralized electricity supply is necessary climate effect is equal to 30 tons of carbon dioxide equivalentsper year per unit and therefore contributes to climate improvement measures
3387088 the only way to test so many wells in such a short time is through field testing kits
3387089 the project will be implemented in partnership with crestanks and poly fibre private companies that produce and distribute plastic toilets
3387090 the two year pilot phase of the project is estimated to cost sh480m of this sh240m was contributed by gtz while the private companies contributed sh120m each crestanks and polyfibre will set up demonstration units on use of the toilet facilities in six pilot parishes in kampala

3387113 these additional voters guarantee virginia will be closer than its been before but closing that entire gap in one election is tough to do
3387114 i think theres no doubt that youth are going to turn out at rates higher than in previous elections
3387115 the question is is that turnout going to be so high that it alone affects the outcome of the election im not willing to say that youth will turn out in such a way that they will shape the election
3387116 nobody can bank on the youth vote because the youth vote hasnt been reliable in the past
3387117 i think his candidacy is getting a whole lot of young people to vote but theyre not going to vote for him
3387118 so this age group gives us our greatest pool for new voters
3387119 also this age group is very mobile moving to a new state for a new job thus i am not surprised that they are the lions share of the new voters
3387120 i think it is very close but it will be a massive upset if obama does carry virginia given our history
3387121 it makes it a closer election but it doesnt necessarily get you over the top if youre the democrat

3387508 in addition to the financial benefits of this transaction we are now poised to devote 100 of our efforts towards exploiting the opportunity for our instruments to be key enablers of breakthrough projects occurring in the areas of stem cell research neural regeneration and biosensing and the increased use of live cell assays for drug discovery and development from an operational perspective the bioforce organization is squarely focused upon exploiting the market opportunities for our molecular printing systems and other instrumentation oriented products and services this is important as we look to expand our presence in the academic research community as well as initiate sales to the commercial sector

3387565 the very first day hayden walked out on the set with the darth vader suit was about two or three weeks before we finished shooting about 1 000 people from all over sydney came to watch it because it was like a seminal iconic moment in their life we tried to let as many people on the stage as we could
3387566 the films bind generations together it grows on the younger people because the mom and dad talk about them they develop a common bond in families

3387573 they invited me into their family and now i can go around the world and hold my head and chin up and say im part of the lucasfilm family new zealand is such a small place i never imagined being in a movie let alone star wars when i had my first day of filming i knew as soon as the first shoot that this was my new family every time i see them they treat me like family

3387616 why is crime fiction so much more interesting than romance horror sci fi and increasingly literary fiction heres my attempt at an answer
3387617 when i used to work at barnes and noble i was punished for minor infractions of the corporate code by being put on the romance fiction information desk
3387618 romance novels are often written by people who dont understand that what makes jane austen good is her story arcs
3387619 i have never read a horror novel because i dont like to be scared and also because of their daunting size
3387620 crime writers dont worry about the views of literary london or new york they dont feel they have to conform to any house style or clich d way of rebellion
3387621 so to sum up like the young cassius clay crime fiction is the prettiest nimblest and deftest of the olympians easily overpowering the lumbering horror and sci fi athletes dodging that lady with the romance handbag and knocking cold that weepy young fogey from kensington whose father never told him he loved him except nobodys father told them they loved them get over it mate stop gurning and go read the cold six thousand instead
3387622 hablar de p del es hablar de reserva del higuer n porque los internacionales de fuengirola se han consolidado como una de las mejores pruebas a nivel mundial
3387623 el apoyo que el ayuntamiento brinda a esta prueba desde su primera edici n a ford como patrocinador oficial y al resto de las empresas que una vez m s confiaron en este espect culo deportivo de primer nivel
3387624 para nosotros es un orgullo poder realizar esta quinta edici n del torneo y queremos agradecer a todos los jugadores que eligieron a reserva del higuer n como la mejor prueba del a o 2007 aunque este a o tendremos muy dif cil repetirlo por el alt simo nivel de los torneos que se han desarrollo en el circuito p del pro tour
3387625 but when it comes to his record american made motorcycles like harleys dont matter to john mccain
3387626 back in washington mccain opposed a requirement that the government buy american made motorcycles
3387627 and he said all buy american provisions were quote disgraceful surprised you shouldnt be this is the same john mccain who supported billions in tax breaks for companies who ship american jobs overseas
3387628 even though its not true many americans will believe it so its a good ad
3387629 gt buffalo bills all pro punter brian moorman 8 also holds for field goals and kicker rian lindell here the pair work out at training camp at st john fisher college
3387630 i feel great and i feel even better about the team
3387631 the optimism the community shows is shared by the team we are excited about what we have put on the field its not like any other year that i have been here
3387632 we work together its like a psychologist we are always trying to improve from each other
3387633 hes really fast and hes got tremendous leg speed like a runner his ability to strike the sweet spot on a ball is better than most other punters
3387634 when i signed with seattle i was just thrilled to be in the league
3387635 i was just thrilled to have a jersey with my name on it i started to improve though and i realized this was not some pipe dream
3387636 nothing is different for kickers and punters the ball is the same the uprights are the same the competition might be different for some of the guys but for kickers it shows people how capable we really are
3387637 you are not going to find a better atmosphere in all of the country
3387638 it is division ii football but it is still good football the fans are amazing and the atmosphere is incredible i would put it up against any other school
3387639 gt brady fultz a dundee high school grad has followed in his dads footsteps and races at black rock
3387640 i have wanted to go racing for as long as i can remember
3387641 i just hung around with dad at the track helping him when i could
3387642 i finished third in the points that first year and fourth in points the following year
3387643 in 2005 dad retired and i jumped into the seat
3387644 i had two wins that season it was three weeks until the end of the season that year when i got taken out and then was rear ended the crash broke the rear end and with little time left in the season and not a lot of money we didnt finish that year the next year black rock introduced the brp late model class and we had a hard time adapting ourselves and the car to that class
3387645 id like to thank suzuki and steve paine who made it possible for us to go sportsman class racing last year
3387646 without my dad first of all i wouldnt be racing
3387647 ive been racing with him for a long time it seems but my uncle allen fultz has been a big help also then racers like steve paine and tim sebring have also been big at helping me
3387648 unless somebody comes along and asks me to drive for them this driving race cars will be just a hobby
3387649 what i would like to do is use my degree in the racing industry like fabrication in a race car shop or a traveling crewman on a race car team
3387650 with two weeks left in the season sitting in second place 12 points behind canandaiguas todd henderson things dont look too good
3387651 todd is running real well right now he will be tough to catch these last two weeks
3387652 i think it is a good question the olympic games attempts to be non political and so i think i sort of see it through a non political lens
3387653 it is a way that we fund the games and allow us to have the biggest athletic competition and therefore the greatest party on earth and i tend to think of it as a non political thing i know that we tend to politicize it but i do not think it is giving tacit approval for what is going on here in china
3387654 china has had to make concessions and i am sure they will continue to do that in the future in order to blend into the world
3387655 obviously we cannot go backwards on globalization we are here as it is and for companies like mcdonalds who you see everywhere in china every single day out there doing things and hiring people and getting chinese to understand what different cultures are about i think it is a good thing
3387656 i think when you open up a country the country behaves differently
3387657 and the olympics opens up a country like no other event in history
3387658 for the issues that people want to pick on them almost all of those negative issues are getting better every day and the olympics does that
3387659 ordstyreren startede m det med at understrege at det var tanken at interesserede parter fik mulighed for at udpege emner som de mente acta skulle omhandle i stedet for at lade eu kommissionen offentligg re information om indhold og status p forhandlingerne

3387662 despite the russian presidents claims earlier this morning that military operations against georgia have been suspended at this moment russian fighter jets are bombarding two georgian villages outside south ossetia
3387663 we will need more evidence everyone in this situation needs a signed binding agreement
3387664 until that happens we are mobilised we are prepared for everything
3387665 i do appreciate it medvedevs gesture but there has been more damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties today

3387670 gott aber steht gottlob nicht unter dem zwang charismen zu schenken
3387671 die wiederkunft jesu christi wird nicht zuerst durch den gerichtsgedanken bestimmt sondern prim r durch den gedanken an ein gro es hochzeitsfest
3387672 jesus ist der br utigam die braut ist das neue das erneuerte israel vor allem wird von hier aus verst ndlich warum jesus selbst ehelos gelebt hat
3387673 der z libat jesu ist damit ein elementarer und wichtiger teil seiner botschaft
3387674 hat jesus kirche gewollt ja auch deshalb weil er den ehebund mit dem neuen gottesvolk will
3387675 es kann sein da ein bew hrter und echter prophet mit einer frau zusammenlebt die er nicht ber hrt und so das geheimnis der kirche auf erden christus und seine braut das gottesvolk in einer zeichenhandlung darstellt
3387676 jesus lebt mit seinem z libat nicht im kloster sondern unter den menschen
3387677 seit wann ist der weltpriester in differenz zum ordenspriester nicht dazu berufen zeichen zu sein
3387678 weil die kirchliche verk ndigung zu wenig vom kommenden reich und zuviel von tagespolitik erf llt war
3387679 das k nnte auswirkungen auf die theologie im ganzen haben
3387680 da man immer angst hat als reaktion r im sinne der orientierung an der vergangenheit zu gelten
3387681 es fehlen die k hnen entw rfe zum beispiel als geschichtstheologie
3387682 darin l t sich der z libat ganz anders einordnen als in der beschr nkung auf das was heute modern ist
3387683 das ist auch eine frage des niveaus der spiritualit t und auch der f higkeit mal etwas theologisches zu denken oder gar dar ber zu reden das wurde zu wenig gepflegt trotzdem beneiden uns viele protestantische freunde darum wie mag es erst in deren herzen aussehen

3387685 unified synthesis product global climate change in the united states
3387686 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
3387687 take the famous ice core data this was the jewel in the crown of global warming theory al gore said it proved a link between carbon dioxide and temperature he failed to mention that in the data the connection was clearly the wrong way round temperature driving co2 levels not the other way round
3387688 but if you take all the chemistry thermal dymanics and theiries about carbon etc and take them down to basic priciples and back them up by the last hundred years of research and scientific findings then you update them with the mass of evidence from all of the recent studies if you do all this and you link to the studies the scientists and all of this is backed by facts the global warming hoax people
3387689 i dont see how dying polarbears has to do with politics or even america

3387691 es el mejor lugar porque no est cerca del sector operativo del puerto donde est n los contendores y adem s tiene la mejor visi n de la ciudad y un acceso r pido a la zona m s tur stica
3387692 el problema principal es que los cruceros que llegan para la pr xima temporada tienen 300 metros de eslora y no da el c rculo de maniobra en la punta del antepuerto para que puedan entrar a las d rsenas la soluci n es correr la escollera exterior de piedra lo que significa una inversi n muy grande pero es imprescindible para el puerto m s all de los cruceros
3387693 abrir la boca de entrada al puerto de los 200 metros actuales a 300
3387694 se habilitar n ex dep sitos de elma y as a los 7000 metros cuadrados de hoy se sumar n 2900 metros cuadrados
3387695 trp habilitar a dos frentes para cruceros estamos dragando la zona de giro frente a la d rsena c para ocuparla y entre las alternativas que estamos evaluando figuran la cabecera del quinto espig n que no est concesionada ah es donde descargan los buques petroleros as que todo depende de las tratativas con camesa otra posibilidad es la cabecera de terbasa
3387696 los cruceros tienen en la ciudad un impacto directo de 100 millones de d lares si tuvi ramos jurisdicci n sobre el puerto lanzar amos de modo inmediato la construcci n de una nueva terminal de cruceros
3387697 se trata de un negocio previsible que deja mucho dinero no s lo por el paso de los barcos y sus pasajeros sino por el recambio de tripulaciones en los pr ximos a os buenos aires deber competir con otras ciudades para atraer cruceros si bien es cierto que todos pronostican el crecimiento de la demanda eso no significa tener un lugar asegurado nos interesa mantener y aumentar la cantidad de barcos que llegan por eso ofrecimos toda la cooperaci n del gobierno porte o para que a n en condiciones que no son las mejores los visitantes est n bien atendidos

3387774 barotex enables our design team to create some of the strongest and most durable automotive components ever produced
3387775 for the natalia sls 2 barotex will be formed into various body panels and our revolutionary d tek chassis where its high strength will add significantly to the automobiles torsional rigidity yet our chassis will be more than a thousand pounds lighter than the conventional steel chassis found on other luxury automobiles of similar size
3387776 in contrast carbon fiber products are petroleum based and we know about the challenges that involves
3387777 not only is lava rock more abundant but our manufacturing process requires far less energy it is friendly to the environment and the automobiles built with barotex are lighter so they use less energy every mile traveled
3387778 we recently received our patent for the proprietary process used to produce barotex
3387779 we are delighted that the first production automobile to integrate this technology will be dimoras natalia sls 2 which abounds with technological breakthroughs from bumper to bumper
3387780 when we began designing our 16 cylinder engine that would erupt with 1200 horsepower we decided to call it the volcano v16 its only natural that we now surround the dimora volcano with volcanic rock from barotex

3387810 in argentina the federal government controls the price of oil gas and refined products and investments in argentina are obviously not as attractive as those in colombia or other parts of the world
3387811 at this time it doesnt make sense to pursue them given the current fiscal structure but we expect at some point in future the situation to change and improve given argentina is now a net natural gas importer and will soon be a net oil importer
3387812 we have a very large prospective land position there which we hope to capitalize on in future but at this time we are retaining our position with the expectation the fiscal environment will improve

3387822 theres a real problem that the bigger retailers will be able to spread the risk but at this point independent retailers could be at a disadvantage and it could deliver even less competition over the longer term

3387824 some people are surprised that asian swimmers have won gold and silver at this olympics
3387825 but at this games i have won gold and silver and weve had zhang lin china win silver so we have shown the world that we can compete we got got medals and were both asian
3387826 i dont know what happened but when i looked back and saw a few smiling faces i realised i had done it
3387827 i went in with a lot of confidence because i had come second in athens but i still had to shoot my best it was a close call but at least it went in my favour
3387828 no longer will a gold medal surprise us never again will we plead with the constellations to allow luck to go our way
3387829 its because i devoted myself heart and soul in this match
3387830 the decision of the uci to proceed to a new analysis of the b sample was in accordance with the letter and spirit of its anti doping regulations and of the international standard for laboratories

3387841 i have observed that in all other countries including in america people are complaining about how prices of gasoline are going up
3387842 the cure is not to reduce the price but on the contrary to raise it even higher to break our addiction to oil we are going to introduce a new tax reform in the direction of even higher taxation on energy and the revenue generated on that will be used to cut taxes on personal income so we will improve incentives to work and improve incentives to save energy and develop renewable energy
3387843 weve had 35 new competitors coming out of china in the last 18 months
3387844 facol and signals and controllers limited are responsible for the maintenance of the traffic light
3387845 keep on receiving the same complaints of power fluctuations hit and run drivers obsolete spare parts and thieves stealing parts of the lights making replacements very difficult
3387846 i am sorry we are not responsible for the traffic lights but go to urban roads and they would help you
3387847 even where you are lucky enough to get some of the spare parts of these obsolete traffic lights they are very expensive as compared to replacing the traffic lights entirely
3387848 under this project all the 138 signalized systems in accra will be computerized monitored and controlled from one control room this means the issue of non functional traffic lights will soon be a thing of the past
3387849 and we should try to catch up with the rest of the world
3387850 claims about the powers of the unconscious are always appealing and seductive
3387851 at worst theyre outright dangerous our research suggests that unconscious thought is more susceptible to irrelevant factors such as how recently information has been seen rather than how important it is
3387852 by going through that process you get to the root of the problem
3387853 and this perhaps provides reasons that you can enter into some kind of decision analysis technique

3387867 the creation of the jim easton global connection classroom will expand and upgrade our teaching and broadcast facilities so that they represent learning tools and connectivity for the 21st century
3387868 creating this global connection classroom in which students faculty and business leaders can actively engage in classroom discussions no matter where they are located in the world was an important factor in my decision to give
3387869 whats the best investment for someone who has only 1 000
3387870 first of all our relationship to the state as it works itself back to our business is we have virtually no contracts directly with any government agencies
3387871 ive never had the occasion to submit bids to the state thats not how we sell our concrete
3387872 we sell ours to either general contractors or concrete contractors were two or three layers removed from the people who actually do the bidding with the state of illinois
3387873 formal documents are submitted and then theyre opened publicly theyre not opened in some back room somewhere where some political guys go around and decide who theyre going to take care of thats really not how it works
3387874 now i could speculate if youre in someones good graces or youre on someones bad list does it somehow affect you in the state of illinois or the city of chicago i dont know but my suspicions are it might because thats what everybody says but thats not been our experience
3387875 its kind of funny because chicago has this kind of sinister mystique about it that in order to do business in chicago youve got to be on the inside youve got to be connected and that usually means youve got to be connected to one of two groups and thats not been our experience
3387876 all i can do is tell you how they deal with it with us
3387877 keep in mind that our family was in politics for a long time
3387878 my uncle and mayor daley were in the state legislature at the same time my dad was an elected delegate to the 1970 constitutional convention and served with mayor daley in that elected body my dad considered mayor daley a personal friend mayor daley knows us well
3387879 we are known for being conservative republicans but were also known for being scrupulous about our integrity and our business dealings were just simply known for that
3387880 i believe our good name and our good reputation precede us when it comes time to pursue business interests in the city of chicago if there are any shenanigans going on they know better than to come to us it just doesnt happen
3387881 when it comes to politics this is their game and their life were nice friendly people but were republicans not democrats theyre going to play the game as hard as they can theres no doubt about it
3387882 they play hard as long as they play within the rules sometimes we call what they do tricks maybe theyre just smart theyll do what they think they can do and need to do to help their cause we have to do the same
3387883 i asked my dad about this years ago when we got into the city we began getting invitations to events by aldermen etc
3387884 he said well we should respect both parties its a two party system and its a good thing it is if it was all democrats or all republicans that wouldnt be healthy
3387885 but we need to rationalize it in our minds somehow that were supporting the american way a two party system
3387886 ive got good customers and good friends that happen to be democrats not everybody i know is a republican theyre all enthused about their candidate or whatever and theyre doing a big fundraising effort id like to be able to respond positively to my friends or customers
3387887 on the other hand what am i supposed to do say no to a good customer my response now is if blagojevich himself came and asked for a contribution he wouldnt have gotten one
3387888 but it turns out these were business related friends of mine who were enthusiastic about their own political acquaintances were doing fund raising
3387889 so thats how i got pulled into giving to blagojevich
3387890 there are people in jail for doing things like that and they should be its wrong to engage in that kind of activity
3387891 this pay to play is that really any different than people in politics whose son or daughter gets a job after they get elected we have all kinds of laws to prevent corruption in my mind i would define getting jobs for relatives as corruption as well but its not so you dont go to jail for doing it
3387892 theres no difference theres no law against it that aggravates me as much as those who are actually breaking the laws you cant blame people for being cynical
3387893 if i get elected to congress that precludes my kids from getting on a payroll somewhere even if thats what one of them wanted to do for a living now he cant because im a public official and it wont look right

3387903 who slipped in among the jewish people in jerusalem and claim to be gods chosen people when in fact they are of lucifer
3387904 in 1967 jerusalem fell to the kenites during the 6 day war
3387905 the kenites who are responsible for the slaying of christ
3387906 this is certainly identity theology inasmuch as he presents a two seedline argument identifies the present inhabitants of israel with the descendants of cain and calls the mating of the serpent with eve the primal sin
3387907 what about teaching serpent seed i make no apology for teaching the word of god
3387908 bless your heart if you have ever been deceived by the kenite and i am speaking now on the spiritual level if you have ever really believed that group was the chosen of god you were deceived by satan
3387909 repent of that even more so than your personal sins in the personal sense
3387910 anyone saying that i use the word kenites to describe judah is not telling the truth
3387911 why do you think their own talmud is the filthiest piece of literature ever written because theyre at home with it they love it its their cup of tea its satans cup of tea
3387912 murray is a bit distinctive in one respect and that is the emphasis on kenites
3387913 none of the central figures in the formation of christian identity speak of the kenites
3387914 hell say he loves the jews its the kenites he doesnt like
3387915 just try and nail him down on it theres a semantic game that goes on frankly the only real benefit which i have ever seen of knowing who the kenites are is that knowledge makes many people prejudiced against jews assuming they are kenites i know that is not explicitly what pastor murray teaches but that is what it does to many shepherds chapel students i have known
3387916 by 1996 i owned and had studied every single subject cassette available at the time
3387917 lets get one thing straight coming out the gate are you saying we should hate judah that would be stupid indeed
3387918 the angels will take care of the tares the tares are taken together in the fire thats the end of the world thats how its going to be
3387919 to say i teach racism or practice racism is another outright lie we have people of all races that attend and study with the shepherds chapel
3387920 yep murray is lukewarm he is half right which makes him all dangerous
3387921 ive been studying with the chapel for about 15 years
3387922 murray believes that blacks are exactly the same as whites in the eyes of god
3387923 god created different races and thats the way he wanted us to stay
3387924 was to destroy those of different races who had intermixed
3387925 we have to review our policy can we consider a partner a country who behaves like this
3387926 its time to stop sticking our head in the sand
3387927 one must not hurry on such serious issues as serious mistakes can be made that have to be paid for a long time afterwards
3387928 its very difficult for any country to take the same view of the eu russian relationship as they did before
3387929 the russian behaviour has been so egregious that we cant close our eyes any more
3387930 its a pro democracy pro rule of law coalition that is emerging right now
3387931 the visa facilitation policy was complicit in what happened in georgia
3387932 we regret that the not granting of natos membership action plan map to georgia was seen as a green light for aggression in the region
3387933 im really happy to be studying the language of my ancestors
3387934 i wish they had the language institute here when i was a kid
3387935 as time goes by the language could die now theres a chance for it to survive
3387936 i speak the language at home but i dont write it
3387937 it was weird to be in a class of children theyre the age of my daughter
3387938 first i want to understand the language and then i want to compare it with arabic
3387939 aramaic is to arabs what latin is to europeans its the root of our language
3387940 professor myers there is a palpable level of hatred towards religion on your blog
3387941 the face of the new atheism irrational dogmatic and hate filled
3387942 sacrilege consists in profaning or treating unworthily the sacraments and other liturgical actions as well as persons things or places consecrated to god sacrilege is a grave sin especially when committed against the eucharist for in this sacrament the true body of christ is made substantially present for us
3387943 reprehensible inexcusable and unconstitutional his flagrant display of irreverence by profaning a consecrated host from a catholic church goes beyond the limit of academic freedom and free speech
3387944 i was brought up as a casual lutheran and left the church when i was 14
3387945 i was not fervent in my beliefs it was one of those things where you go to church every week
3387946 has been selling everybody a bill of goods for so many years its about time somebody spoke up and said that its a load of nonsense
3387947 there is this general property of religion its great at building community religion has been a good thing for many individuals it has brought them together and given them comfort but over all religion holds back humanity
3387948 that because for so many years people got smallpox smallpox is to be credited for all the virtue men have done
3387949 pz myers would have you believe that faith is a crutch something that makes you feel better but in the long run holds you back
3387950 this is an old saw faith and not the trappings of faith religiosity is no crutch it is a lifelong process that holds us accountable to a person a personal god and not some abstract philosophy
3387951 pz knew that we were making a film about evolution and religion he even signed the release that gave the filmmakers the right to use the footage as they saw fit
3387952 out there to stir up outrage and make money for himself he is there to play the martyr and feed the persecution complex
3387953 part egotist part bigot his behavior is clearly designed to insult hurt and intimidate catholics
3387954 we want to know what the university of minnesota morris is going to do about professor myers
3387955 clearly the university would act in a situation in which someone was burning a cross to harass african americans or spray painting swastikas to intimidate jews why will they not act in this case
3387956 affirms the freedom of a faculty member to speak or write as a public citizen without institutional discipline or restraint
3387957 you have throughout your blog described catholics as stupid stupider scary dark age fanatics
3387958 you have insulted and hurt thousands of catholics what do you have to say for that
3387959 the whole silly part of this whole episode is that ive got so many people writing me and saying that i have seriously hurt them but what have i done i have thrown away a cracker
3387960 like a little girl trying to hurt another little girl by pulling the head off her doll
3387961 is it evil yes but having said that know that he is acting out of anger some hurt
3387962 but even in this inverted action dont you see what christ is doing he is once again going to the cross so that we may draw nearer to him
3387963 rather than coming down on us with fire as we might deserve he is loving us through his humiliation and suffering turning us back to him
3387964 a sari is more like a wrapped dress i believe the name for this begins with something like a k or hard c
3387965 well my dad is so tall he can reach the moon
3387966 the timing is right for this demonstration weve seen a massive increase of interest in targeted advertising and are already working with iptv broadcasters network owners and vendors not to mention advertising agencies and brands mobile tv is a vital part of the rapidly changing world of tv and is a vital part of our roadmap like packet vision udcast is a pioneer in its particular area of innovation with a proven track record and global reach so there is a natural synergy between the two companies
3387967 we expect targeted advertising to be an important element of mobile tv business models including free to air services where finding ways to generate revenue from advertising will be essential udcasts mobile tv solutions are compliant with majority of standards deployed across the world we are in an ideal position to provide the global platform for delivering mobile tv so it makes sense to work with packet vision which we believe is at the forefront of delivering targeted advertising technology on ip video networks
3387968 wont we be going after them it would be easy to follow them as their leader is wounded

3388068 a warning to scalawags in the police force mend your evil ways or you will be next
3388069 i felt my hands and feet freed of the contraption and carelessly dragged to some corner
3388070 its looking beyond and evaluating a situation while taking into account regional socioeconomic and military processes preparing systems and using good sense and judgment that is not based on familiarity with just one field it means asking the right questions and finding solutions to problems thats what is required in a leader
3388071 livnis exaggerated response to baraks ethical statement about the necessary qualifications for prime minister is astonishing
3388072 its unreasonable that livni herself thinks that the qualifications necessary for prime minister should be decided by a handful of registered kadima members we didnt hear her protest barak intervening in internal kadima matters when he forced the party to hold the primary that she is running in now
3388073 internment camps are being made ready for those who refuse to leave willingly
3388074 all possessions of those who oppose the expulsion will become state property
3388075 children of demonstrators will be removed from their parents homes and sent to be re educated

3388084 what the heck if its time for me to go ill go
3388085 the dog moved forward to attack the officer three times but stopped on the first and second attempt
3388086 on the third attack the dog moved forward and just didnt stop
3388087 shell have fun fun fun till her daddy takes her t bird away
3388088 he cant cross the bridge on bike its against the law
3388089 so im looking for a place where i can pick him up and drive him across
3388090 were glad to be close to home its been a long trip
3388091 for me and my dad to have all this time together has been special but we miss all the family events its time to be home
3388092 demand for apartment residences is holding up relatively well despite the weakening job market and sluggish economy if employment continues to fall however well likely see apartment demand follow suit
3388093 at the same time the financial markets have still not returned to normal with the cmbs market and many banks effectively sidelined
3388094 the apartment industry remains reasonably well as a result of continuing fallout from the for sale housing market and the fact that apartment firms did not overbuild during the latest economic cycle
3388095 like the market for single family homes the housing slump and the recent turmoil in the financial markets are also distressing the condo market
3388096 the hope now is that the housing stimulus bill signed into law last week by the president will support a much needed turnaround in all sectors of the housing market including condos
3388097 they had a lot of energy paid attention tried to do their assignments and hustled
3388098 there were a lot of good things in it again im looking for more out of this football team we have some ability we are fast but i still think its just a gut feeling that weve got to push a little harder with this group
3388099 tristan is really having a good fall camp so far im proud of him
3388100 if he stays healthy and does the right things this is going to be trays year
3388101 if he can get a full year under his belt well probably be national champions to tell you the truth hes the best middle linebacker ive ever seen or ever played with
3388102 the authorities have already threatened imprisonment should we refuse to give in to their demands
3388103 our plan is to campaign among our peers in the university to support our cause
3388104 as benny was saying these there was a lump forming in his throat
3388105 apparently we dont get the benefits of this enormous project
3388106 we need to join forces forget about our thirst for vengeance and make a concerted effort to fight for what we hold dear our ancestral homes
3388107 lets forget about past transgressions tribal wars wont allow us to retain our lands there will be no lands to own once we grant permission for the dams construction our barrio folks should be aware of this fact
3388108 we dont have any document to show we own the land
3388109 nobody owns the land not even the government it is an ancestral land where our fathers and our forefathers have lived for hundreds of years if ownership is to be established the land belongs to us because we nurtured and cultivated it
3388110 i was afraid you would not talk to me if you would come to know
3388111 stay in the shadows we have been marked martial law has been declared
3388112 they took him away he was at the entrance when they came
3388113 i am ka pepe we were not introduced during the meeting for your own protection but it seems someone has betrayed us we have been spied upon and marked and now the whole army will be after us
3388114 we are students we respect your ideals and what you stand for but we would opt to fight the inequities of the government through legal means
3388115 benny allow me to call you that tomorrow your face will be in the wanted list all over the country you are branded now as an activist and as a supporter you have nowhere to run but up the mountains we are your only salvation
3388116 it must be understood that they are not litigants in any adversarial proceedings
3388117 we will take the region under complete control in a few days

3388123 hay significativos avances en la persecuci n del delito de incendio forestal que invita a pensar que estamos ante el comienzo del fin de la impunidad con la que actuaban los incendiarios
3388124 no hay que acostumbrarse a que se desconozca el origen del 40 por ciento de los incendios que se producen o que s lo se juzgue a uno de cada mil incendiarios
3388125 en especial el castigo a los responsables de los grandes incendios forestales debe ser ejemplarizante para evitar que estos se produzcan
3388126 nos ha ayudado todo lo que ha podido pero estas son fechas complicadas para tener aparatos libres

3388129 a child is not a property or commodity issues relating to custody of minors have to be handled with love and affection
3388130 one of the matters which is required to be considered by a court of law is the character of the proposed guardian
3388131 a child is not a property or commodity issues relating to custody of minors and tender aged children have to be handled with love affection sentiments and by applying human touch to the problem
3388132 when we asked him whether he wanted to go to his father and to stay with him he unequivocally refused to go with him or stay with him he also stated that he was very happy with his maternal grand parents and would like to stay with them
3388133 we are convinced that the courts below were not right or justified in granting custody of minor antariksh to abhijit without applying relevant and well settled principle of welfare of the child as paramount consideration

3388136 you can continue serving as an altar boy and can go to school simultaneously
3388137 i just dont feel right but i cant say exactly what it is
3388138 you describe your life as though it was someone elses life
3388139 my emotions serve me well trust them as clues to help me grow
3388140 a life is a rhythm dance and this too shall pass
3388141 what is it that i am resisting that keeps me from accepting this moment as it is
3388142 forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us
3388143 we cant solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them
3388144 clark gregg who directed the movie version of choke which comes out on september 26 in the us he knew that id written choke while listening to radioheads pablo honey with creep over and over and over so clark got radiohead to contribute a song to write a song for the very end of the movie the final credits apparently radiohead liked the movie so much theyve written the score most of the ambient music throughout it
3388145 comcast has not used nor authorized others to use its facilities as an internet provider to tailor or facilitate the tailoring of internet advertising to its comcast high speed internet customers

3388147 it would take at least six months to reconfigure the states payroll system to issue blanket checks at the federal minimum wage of 6 55 per hour
3388148 it would take an additional nine to 10 months to issue back pay to employees when the budget is approved
3388149 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3388150 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3388151 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3388152 the bible is clear that christians should give with a cheerful heart
3388153 upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as god hath prospered him that there be no gatherings when i come
3388154 we should tithe 10 it says so in the bible
3388155 because we are not under the curse of the law anymore
3388156 the bible only says that we should give cheerfully that can be one dollar or one hundred
3388157 i have never seen a tithe mentioned in the new testament
3388158 i havent learned much about this subject but i think it includes anything of value not just money
3388159 giving ten percent is a good amount god suggested it but you can give anything you want
3388160 there are so many times that our dreams and goals are too small
3388161 if ever any beauty i did see which i desired and got twas but a dream of thee
3388162 christ did indeed on the cross say it is finished but he never said i quit
3388163 yang rajih ialah pendapat pertama ia berdasarkan dalil dalil yang kuat dan bertepatan dengan maqasid syariah manakala pendapat kedua ia sangat lemah dan berlawanan dengan dalil dalil yang sahih
3388164 masalah ini adalah masalah khilaf dan diharuskan berijtihad padanya tetapi saya lebih cenderung kepada pendapat pertama kedua tetapi tidak boleh ingkar terhadap pendapat yang berlawanan
3388165 alcuni si lamentano di coloro che non fanno nulla alcuni e questi gente pi misteriosa incutono maggior spavento si lamentano perch non hanno nulla da fare quando vengon loro regalate belle ore o bei giorni vuoti borbottano perch sono vuoti se si fa loro il dono della solitudinr che dono di libert lo buttano via lo vogliono distruggere deliberatamente con qualche orribile gioco di carte o con una piccola palla esprimo soltanto le mie opinioni personali so che il mondo bello perch vario ma non posso reprimere un brivido quando vedo buttar via col fare qualcosa le vacanze guadagnate con fatica da parte mia non posso procurarmi mai abbastanza niente da fare mi sembra di non avere avuto mai il tempo libero per disfare neppure la decima parte dei pacchi della mia vita e dei miei pensieri non v bisogno di dire che non v nulla di misantropico nel mio desiderio di isolamento tuttaltro talvolta nella mia morbosa adolescenza fui nel senso peggiore solitario in piena societ nella mia virilit non mi son mai sentito pi socievole che nella solitudine

3388167 in this crazy world around us where anything can happen i am making a promise to you that you can depend on me
3388168 we have had her longer than our two children which are 4 and 7 so shes been with us 8 years
3388169 that gives her the ability to go into hospital nursing homes and able to do rehab with adults children whatever because through training have certified that she will not attack
3388170 we already had the insurance policy active we had already paid for it and he reported back to insurance carrier that we had a bull mastiff on the property
3388171 i was pretty shocked shes 8 years old so it was pretty surprising to me
3388172 they did not ask us and obviously if they did ask us we would have told them its not like were hiding her
3388173 one beacon will provide coverage for pets that are known to not have aggressive tendencies this position was developed through company research that suggests certain breeds including the bull mastiff have a greater propensity to bite and cause fatalities as a result we consider the bull mastiff unacceptable for underwriting purposes
3388174 we do allow for limitations of particular breeds of dogs if they are in the filed guidelines of that company
3388175 there are certainly many verses in the bible that refer to demons
3388176 saul was a jew and filled with the holy spirit later he was tormented by a demon
3388177 ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world
3388178 you can be harassed and tempted but demons cannot get inside of you and control you if you belong to christ
3388179 it could be possible because the bible talks about it
3388180 i have heard that the devil and the holy spirit can both live in your heart
3388181 there is no good reason for a devoted christian to consume hard alcohol
3388182 it keeps christians from surrendering themselves to christ and christ alone
3388183 the last thing a christian needs is to be addicted to another worldly idol
3388184 just like everything else in life that is good too much of one thing can be bad
3388185 it is not a sin to drink alcohol and even jesus drank wine which is a pretty hard form of alcohol
3388186 christ freed us to make our own decisions and live with our own repercussions besides one glass of alcohol a day is very healthy
3388187 the problem is when people drink too much it makes you wonder what they are trying to hide from
3388188 i am not sure what the bible says on this matter
3388189 jesus drank wine but is that considered hard liquor i just dont know
3388190 hmmm i think ill write a free version to compete with this
3388191 you can get started in the homebrewing hobby for under 100
3388192 brew day will take a couple of hours and bottling day will take a couple of hours but everything in between is just waiting
3388193 the cooking part on brewing day will take up the stove and some counter space as well as the sink after that the space requirement shrinks to the size of a 7 gallon bucket
3388194 brewing is really part science part cooking and part creativity
3388195 after all the work and waiting there is nothing better than cracking the first beer from your first batch
3388196 most christians agree that an interpretation must follow if someone speaks in tongues
3388197 we are living in new testament times just as the early christians were
3388198 on the day of pentecost each one heard the apostles speak in their own native language
3388199 we no longer need signs to show us the presence of the holy spirit
3388200 is a sin but as christians we are to repent and sin no more
3388201 i dont know why i guess i was just greedy
3388202 there was just too much temptation i saw the wallet lying there with no one around and i took it
3388203 of course i have though about it but i decided to follow gods laws instead
3388204 i may have taken a pen or something from work but i never stole anything intentionally
3388205 everyone at my office uses supplies and sometimes we take them home but i dont think this is stealing
3388206 there is definitely a grey area when it comes to stealing i may or may not have crossed it it depends on an individuals perspective
3388207 the bible seems clear that if a spouse commits in their heart then it is just as sinful as committing the physical act
3388208 the bible says emotional cheating is just as bad as physical cheating
3388209 i love my spouse and i would never want to hurt him like that i took marriage vows
3388210 my husband is never home and even when he is he pays no attention to me
3388211 i was cheated on first so i got back at him
3388212 i took marriage vows to be physically faithful not emotionally i cant control every thought that comes into my head
3388213 gods word makes it clear that there is a place after death where people are separated from him for eternity
3388214 i dont really know if there is or isnt im not dead yet
3388215 i dont know whether or not there is an actual place of hell or if the soul is just tormented without god
3388216 god cant be the essence of love and allow this to happen
3388217 there will be a lake of fire after the great throne judgment
3388218 is it a sin for christians to play the lottery
3388219 any action that causes christians to be poor should be avoided
3388220 playing the lottery is gambling and gambling is a sin
3388221 it is a game of chance and the bible tells us we are to be good stewards with the money he has given us
3388222 gambling away gods money shows a lack of faith in his holy word and his promises
3388223 i cant find in the bible where gambling is a sin
3388224 i dont think god cares as long as its in moderation
3388225 as long as you use the money for good it doesnt matter
3388226 christ released my shackles when he died on the cross
3388227 gambling is when no one benefits but the casino owners
3388228 controlled as a form of discipline can be found in the bible
3388229 all actions should have consequences a swat on the butt is okay
3388230 as long as it is done without anger and the punishment is within reason
3388231 corporal punishment is unproductive and sows negative feelings in the child
3388232 christ said anyone who harms a child throw him in the river
3388233 a time out or other type of correction would make more sense
3388234 i was spanked as a child sometimes i deserved it and sometimes i didnt
3388235 in order for christians to combat the theory of evolution taught in our schools they must understand the different meanings
3388236 i have no earthy idea what you are talking about
3388237 i have heard of this but i never looked it up
3388238 micro evolution is variations within the kind while macro evolution is changes from one kind to another
3388239 i know the difference because a friend brought it up once
3388240 micro evolution is another name for natural selection and is not evolution at all
3388241 i know that micro means small and macro means large
3388242 i would say from an assembly perspective the pain is largely behind us
3388243 in the first five years of life 85 percent of the brain is developed
3388244 those early relationships more than anything else help wire the brain and provide children with the experience to trust to develop language to communicate they need that system to relate to the world
3388245 it has come to my attention that there are recent reports circulating regarding my daughter i would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you who are genuinely concerned about reginae and her safety
3388246 please allow me to dispel any rumors or speculations and report that my daughter is alive healthy and surrounded by family who care and love her dearly the rumors are completely false and unfounded neither reginae nor any other member of my family has been involved in any car accident my family and i truly appreciate the concern and support shown to us
3388247 jo and siennas dad ed had a few concerns as any parents would but sienna convinced jo she is happy so shes happy for her daughter
3388248 sienna knew they would get on really well balthazar is a lovely guy
3388249 balthazar thinks its a bit soon for sienna to meet his children that is something that will come with time but he is obviously secure enough in their relationship to want to show off his new love to his friends
3388250 me and my wife were asleep i woke up and all the people in the bus fell to one side
3388251 i keep trying to pull my wife out and she says help me
3388252 she was stuck in the chair or something there were people on top of her it was people locked together
3388253 the cas panel was of the opinion that the decision of the uci to proceed to a new analysis of the b sample was in accordance with the letter and spirit of the uci anti doping regulations
3388254 it was a very bad experience because i didnt understand what was happening but everything has turned out as i expected
3388255 ive spent many years cycling and i cant chuck it all in but sometimes you feel like it because there are so many injustices
3388256 the fans who like cycling dont want to see this sort of thing cycling is a spectacle that involves sacrifice if not you dont get the results
3388257 some sports such as weightlifting have a pretty bad record and that is demonstrated time and again with numerous athletes from that sport
3388258 i think weightlifting understands as cycling understands that there is a huge risk for both those sports if the cheating is continued and continued to be exposed
3388259 there is no sport that anybody can suggest is doping free but there are some sports that have had a history and i would suggest theres a level or a culture of doping that has developed in some of those sports
3388260 if this is confirmed it represents an act of irresponsibility
3388261 its a sad situation and the federation should open an inquiry to discover who put this idea into the cyclists head
3388262 i hate to do this to you buddy but someone is going to get hurt and like andy always says it aint gonna be me
3388263 i was trying to pitch for as long as i could
3388264 when you get through the seventh and eighth thats when its more of a big deal
3388265 i thought maybe a year off would be a good idea at one point i thought that would be it for me
3388266 i threw with him a couple times just to see where i was at
3388267 i was giving pitching lessons and just staying in baseball
3388268 id been trying to come back for awhile and my parents had been on me about it
3388269 the marlins were awesome in letting me come back and prove i could still pitch
3388270 it was more of a relief when i gave up the hit
3388271 i didnt have to worry about how many innings id be able to go
3388272 ive had a couple a good starts its kind of up and down this year today i got to throw all my pitches for strikes i kept the hitters off balance we had a strong wind so i was just trying to get ground balls i kept the ball low
3388273 he has a nice feel for the game and hes a decent passer with good size however he lacks quickness and toughness and doesnt shoot the ball well with range he is a below average athlete
3388274 several chinese reporters had their notebooks and at least one tape recorder confiscated after a news conference held by the us mens volleyball team
3388275 i am not very clear about the situation you raised

3388301 you might consider cuban a hypocrite for wanting these types of tournaments while shooting down the olympics however cubans anti olympics stance is based on his belief that the basketball part of the games are about money not patriotism and he wants mavs coaches to be able to work with the teams players over the summer so some extra wear and tear on the players bodies is ok as long as its under the watch of the coaches cuban pays and it makes his bank account bigger

3388306 humorous team photos are nothing new to the basketball world one striking pose self link by the 2002 sacramento kings has been passed around like a virus the past year but theres a space between humorous and offensive the valley of the blatantly stupid the spanish mens national basketball team visited it last month the guardian reports via deadspin the spanish team recently took out a full page ad in marca featuring the above photo the 15 man squad all mocking the eyes of their olympic hosts its a shock upon our camraderian sensibilities for sure but hardly the worst thing spanish athletes have done
3388307 the difference seems to be that the pros play out the shot in their brains allowing them to make a call just from looking at the players body says salvatore aglioti of the sapienza university of rome italy when his team repeated the experiment with subjects wired to a device that measured activity in the brain regions controlling two arm muscles they found that the pros relied on a circuit that harnesses the abductor digiti minimi the pinkies main muscle early in the video pros activated this region during missed balls but not during shots that swished in the other groups brain activities remained the same no matter the time point or whether the shot was a brick or a basket aglioti speculates that professionals can read the spin imparted on the ball by focusing on the flick of the pinkie

3388351 whenever we go in villages a large number of people surround us
3388352 wherever we have a camp we make it a point to carry at least 10 000 to 15 000 saplings each time i keep on telling the farmers that it is their fixed deposit since we are not having a government job and do not have the facility of having a pension after retirement so it is a noble way of warding off poverty and pollution at the same time

3388438 we now have a better idea of where these brain tumors come from and their relationship to normal stem cells in the brain
3388439 medulloblastoma was one of the first tumors that was believed to fit the hypothesis that tumors are caused by cancer stem cells that initiate malignancies and sustain them
3388440 but the prevailing hypothesis that medulloblastomas originate from non stem cells just did not make perfect sense with this
3388441 there must be susceptibility factors in the granule neuron precursor cell that predispose it to forming cancer so we now must try to understand what it is about this cell type that makes it susceptible to forming cancer in response to sonic hedgehog signaling this relationship between stem cells and oncogenes suggests a new point of potential therapeutic intervention
3388442 though there were areas of overlap we found that common motivations for self benefit included interaction with the birds a sense of achievement social interaction personal stimulation and enjoyment
3388443 past research shows that people take part in wildlife activities for many reasons and so require a sophisticated level of management our findings reinforce that
3388444 though self satisfaction motivations were mentioned most often people also had many unselfish reasons for taking part in conservation including helping this vulnerable species preserving nature for future generations and serving the community
3388445 with declining budgets most wildlife agencies are not well equipped to manage the growing number of species at risk so they are depending more on volunteers to help with wildlife management operations
3388446 we had been through several inspections they were all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were spectators from various divisions especially a leader from the politburo who gave us his opinion it must change

3388451 a worldwide audience of billions swooned over the beijing ceremony
3388452 i dont think anybody really thought it would turn out like this
3388453 the roots of this tragedy lie in the decision of georgias separatist leaders in 1991 to abolish south ossetian autonomy this turned out to be a time bomb for georgias territorial integrity each time successive georgian leaders tried to impose their will by force both in south ossetia and in abkhazia where the issues of autonomy are similar it only made the situation worse new wounds aggravated old injuries
3388454 what happened on the night of aug 7 is beyond comprehension
3388455 the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity
3388456 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
3388457 of course peace in the caucasus is in everyones interest but it is simply common sense to recognize that russia is rooted there by common geography and centuries of history russia is not seeking territorial expansion but it has legitimate interests in this region

3388459 for instance weve learned that when someone has a haploid insufficiency and is missing one copy of the tgf gene he or she is more vulnerable to environmental insults that can cause cleft palate such as drugs smoking and alcohol
3388460 we found that if we blocked tgf or the receptors a cleft palate develops
3388461 but when smad4 was blocked normal palate epithelium still covered the palatal shelf
3388462 this information is useful not just for palate and teeth but also for cancer and cell biology in general

3388472 its not like picking someone up off manly beach and taking them to the royal north shore
3388473 its inefficient because the kids end up getting the wealth
3388474 if the aim is to improve peoples living standards in old age we have to think of ways to avoid that happening
3388475 the reason for that is although i support the principle of giving consumers better information fuelwatch will have the unintended consequence of squeezing out independents
3388476 the benefits are unclear the government hasnt released any modelling to show whether there would be benefits
3388477 under fuelwatch they have to set their prices for 24 hours if they make a bad call they cop it and lose sales
3388478 if you are an independent with just one or two or three outlets your ability to manage that risk is much more limited than coles or woolworths who have hundreds of outlets
3388479 if we know who what and where then well know when and why

3388501 research in recent years has demonstrated that even very little babies know a lot about the outside world this has led many to suggest that we are born with a great deal of the knowledge we need but these new findings urge us to think differently about early development despite having a good grasp of what goes on in the outside world young babies may have more difficulties in understanding how they themselves and their bodies fit into that world

3388543 we know from many clinical studies of patients and their families that our cells can tolerate a rather large amount of mutant mitochondrial dna with no significant loss of function
3388544 these new clinical measurements have given direct evidence for the widespread incidence of pathogenic mitochondrial dna mutations in the human population these findings emphasize the pressing need to develop effective ways to interrupt the transmission of these mutations to the next generation
3388545 i feel i can score goals for the club and am looking forward to linking with the likes of jo kuffour and brett pitman

3388554 no hay nada que explicar me remito a los resultados del ltimo a o
3388555 es el m ximo candidato al oro porque la pista del torneo ol mpico es una de sus superficies predilectas se desenvuelve mejor y ha obtenido mejores resultados
3388556 cuando vi el cuadro hewitt aparec a como el rival m s fuerte pero sigo viendo el torneo complicado es cierto que ante hewitt especialista en esta superficie jugu un gran partido andreev es complicado tambi n igual que el resto si alguno de los favoritos ha perdido pues mejor
3388557 las sensaciones van y vienen y ojal que ahora pueda mantener el nivel no creo tampoco que haya habido mucha diferencia entre el primer partido y este el duelo contra starace me sirvi para coger el ritmo de la competici n
3388558 hay momentos en los que est s mejor y otros peor se hace duro este es el a o que menos he parado en casa que m s he competido y eso se acusa
3388559 for those of who dont already know i have multiple jobs

3388562 i aint as pissed as you are to be living your life
3388563 i turned around to my dad and said thats exactly what i want to do
3388564 breastfeeding promotion programs encourage women to start but dont provide the support to continue
3388565 we are finding that breastfeeding rates arent just explained by the individuals who live in these areas theres something about the areas themselves and breastfeeding

3388573 this study supports the use of 11c pib pet in the evaluation of beta amyloid deposition in for example mild cognitive impairment alzheimers disease or normal pressure hydrocephalus
3388574 large and prospective studies are required to verify whether 11c pib pet will become a tool in diagnosing alzheimers disease another potential use of 11c pib would be the quantitative monitoring of beta amyloid deposits in the brain in subjects under treatment in pharmaceutical trials of early alzheimers disease targeting amyloid accumulation

3388591 ive not done much gardening in the past but i really enjoyed designing it and getting started this morning i really like being a junior warden mentor because i get to do things i wouldnt usually do
3388592 the community wardens work has expanded beyond our expectations whilst visiting elderly members of the community we realised that there needed to be more interaction between older and younger residents
3388593 this garden is an excellent opportunity for the junior wardens to use their creativity get out in the fresh air and produce something worthwhile to benefit the community
3388594 ive spoken to avram and hes alive although he is naturally quite shaken with the crash being so close to where he was standing
3388595 the undercarriage of the plane was completely crushed after it smashed into nearby trees and somehow the pilot who suffered minor injuries was able to get out
3388596 there had been some reports that he had been killed but i can assure everyone that he is in fact alive but still in a bit of shock after the event
3388597 i have been in this job 10 years now and i sense a mood for something to happen
3388598 if we had mentioned this three years ago i think the reaction would have been different
3388599 now everyone club chairmen managers players officials fans media are all saying we saw things last season that overstepped the mark
3388600 if we see unacceptable behaviour we should make it unacceptable
3388601 we are not just saying managers and players have to behave referees have to meet players halfway as well and fans have to back off a little bit in terms of the vitriol
3388602 i do not want to take the passion out of the game but it would be nice to take some of the venom away
3388603 we have reached the stage where the whole situation needs correcting
3388604 it is difficult to say that without making it appear that we are trying to sanitise everything that is not what we are saying at all
3388605 we want the passion and rivalries what we dont want is some of that blatant disrespect and abuse
3388606 when people talk about commercialisation and money they cannot forget it only comes because we are a spectator sport
3388607 we do not succeed at anything unless we get the football right
3388608 there comes a time when you have to say the product needs a little bit of tweaking we said we would do it now is the time
3388609 the door is shut now the players cant go full stop
3388610 clubs are trying to unsettle some of my players i dont like it its my first job in the premier league and the last thing i want to do is sell my best players
3388611 benni is definitely one of them and theres plenty more as far as im concerned the situation is closed
3388612 theres always going to be speculation about players but i can categorically say 100 per cent that nobody will be leaving this club
3388613 robbie is okay hes fit but he just needs to get his sharpness and ive told him that
3388614 if we can get him right then theres no reason why he cant play a part in the season if you look at teddy sheringham he played until he was 41
3388615 my job is to try to help clubs produce scottish players and give them an opportunity to play for their country
3388616 if they get opportunities for their clubs especially on a big stage with a team like rangers that can only be good for the scottish game
3388617 finances in england are huge because of the tv money and the income they bring in thats the reality
3388618 players do leave but good players come in as well the spl is a very competitive league it was tremendous last season going to the last game and there was some exciting football
3388619 i said at the time when barry got injured that it would be a huge loss for scottish football both for rangers and for scotland
3388620 it has been shown how much rangers have missed him but we cant do anything about it
3388621 barry is working hard on his rehabilitation and hopefully he will have a speedy recovery but he has to be right before he can play and that could be another couple of months
3388622 we have other players in our squad who we feel are very capable in that department ive still got selection problems in terms of who to leave out so weve got players who can fill that role
3388623 as a country we are fortunate to have so many outstanding midfield players i think ive got the midfield squad to cope while rangers got a few injuries at the worst possible time for them
3388624 we have a number of older players with experience who i know can do the job
3388625 certainly for the world cup qualifiers ill have a look at things and it might be a case of bringing more experience in
3388626 none of these players have been ruled out but ive taken the opportunity to bring younger players in to have a look at knowing ill probably bring one or two more experienced players in for the world cup qualifiers
3388627 weve brought a few new players into the squad and the game is only two and a half weeks before the world cup qualifiers start
3388628 ill be looking for a positive game in terms of hopefully winning the game which i think would be important and in terms of being a bit more positive in our attacking play
3388629 i watched northern ireland on video beating georgia 4 1 and they were excellent so its going to be a tough game i know they are bringing 5 000 or 6 000 fans and im sure there will be a good turn out
3388630 im certainly looking for a positive game we will take the opportunity to have a look at one or two players but the nucleus of the squad for the macedonia game will be playing
3388631 i might introduce one or two experienced players for the world cup but there wont be major changes
3388632 we have the nucleus of an outstanding team but we have to be that bit more positive
3388633 auditory or visual auditory responses in the primary visual cortex are highly probable given the presence of direct projections from the primary auditory cortex
3388634 we looked for modulation of the neuronal visual responses in the primary visual cortex by auditory stimuli in an awake monkey
3388635 our findings show that single neurons from one primary sensory cortex can integrate information from another sensory modality
3388636 our results argue against a strict hierarchical model of sensory integration in the brain and that integration of multiple senses should be added to the list of functions of the primary visual cortex

3388655 using x rays to find solutions to earth science questions is an area that has been highly active on the srs at daresbury laboratory for some time we are very excited that the srs has contributed to answering such long standing questions about the earth in this way
3388656 the resources available at daresburys srs for high pressure research have been crucial in helping us determine the origin of these diamonds and their inclusions
3388657 for many people the temptation may be to ignore the problem until one or two repayments have been missed and the lender has then written threatening court action
3388658 however often by this stage the options may already be more limited this new service is trying to encourage people to seek help at the earliest opportunity whilst there is still room for negotiation with the lender
3388659 with the credit crunch on everyones minds this service has come just at the right time
3388660 it is surprisingly easy to fall behind on mortgage repayments and lose your home many people may never have thought they would need help and this is exactly why this service has been established and is available for everyone in exeter

3388669 this is a worrying theme we cant seem to attract anyone any more

3388691 i had told myself long ago that three books in a series are enough for my attention span and so after i devoted myself to the trio of books in the tales of london series then wrote a table by the window my contemporary novel
3388692 prayerfully i decided to return to gresham setting the story fifteen years after julia hollis and her children first left london for abandoned coaching inn which became larkspur inn i believe readers would like to see how the children philip aleda and grace elizabeth and laurel turn out as adults but i like to inject fresh faces into every book hence jewel libby and her daughter becky find gresham a haven from a bad man writing the book was like coming home visiting old friends
3388693 heck who are we to tell someone else how to conduct themselves when it comes to war peace democracy and human rights
3388694 the days of overthrowing leaders by military means in europe is over
3388695 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3388696 following a course that is horrifyingly similar to that taken by stalin and hitler in the 1930s
3388697 the undermining of the sovereignty of a small democratic neighbouring state through the use of violence
3388698 georgia is to an extent the finland of today both morally and strategically
3388699 reincorporate old soviet areas into the kremlins sphere of control
3388700 if georgia no longer has its sovereignty it means not only that the west is cut off from the caspian sea and central asia but we can also assume that putin will exercise a similar strategy against ukraine if he faces resistance hes already publicly voiced threats against ukraine
3388701 if russia continues on this path it has to be isolated by the international community
3388702 first when bush met putin for the first time and said he had looked into his soul and could trust him secondly when condi rice not so long ago said that the american russian relations had never been better than they are today
3388703 he medvedev has about as much influence over the current situation as the official head of state in the soviet union of the 1950s had over the soviet union nobody can even remember his name
3388704 let me be as clear as i can be i intend to end this war my first day in office i will bring the joint chiefs of staff in and i will give them a new mission and that is to end this war responsibly deliberately but decisively
3388705 to retain flexibilitiy as violence declines in iraq without abandoning a central promise of his campaign that if elected he would end the war
3388706 the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability
3388707 that doesnt take into account what they military leaders anticipate might be some sort of change in conditions
3388708 mr obama cant afford not to update his iraq policy once he has the conversations hes promising with u s commanders he will have plenty of information that contradicts the notion of his rigid plan iraqs improvement means that american forces probably can be reduced next year 2009 but it would be folly to begin a forced march out of the country without regard to the risks of renewed sectarian warfare and escalating intervention in the country by iran and other of iraqs neighbors
3388709 mr obama in iraq did he really find support for his withdrawal plan
3388710 neither u s commanders nor iraqs principal political leaders actually support obamas 16 month strategy
3388711 iraqi prime minister malikis timetable for withdrawal would extend at least seven months beyond mr obamas
3388712 melanie appears to be very determined to do this with or without dod support so i think it is worthwhile to work with her
3388713 get the story straight from the troops without the filter of the liberal media
3388714 intelligence briefings to very important persons vips and senior officers
3388715 in the attachment you will find the letter of response to centcom u s central command about our gold star family member trip to iraq
3388716 would get very good play in the media and tell our story with these dedicated families of our deceased members
3388717 under the cover of utmost secrecy the parents of u s troops who died in iraq have made a surprising and historic visit to iraq
3388718 the trip will allow these parents to see the newly liberated iraq that their children gave their lives for
3388719 a department of defense program that provides opportunities for citizens to show their support for the u s armed forces

3388721 we could have our entire corporate outreach for asy sic done in one meeting
3388722 america supports you is not well known i have spoken to about 30 soldiers and marines and only one knew anything about it and that was because he had just seen a psa public service announcement on afn american forces network
3388723 in the spirit of collaborative research and in the interest of compiling an authoritative record on wartime propaganda we ask that you add your findings to sourcewatch with links back to the relevant pentagon documents and or other sources
3388724 it is regrettable that on the day before the opening of the olympic games the georgian authorities have undertaken aggressive actions in south ossetia
3388725 the crews are assigned the task to not allow arms and military hardware supplies to reach georgia by sea
3388726 they are state criminals who must be tried for the crimes committed in south ossetia the genocide of the ossetian people
3388727 its really really quiet eerily quiet everyone was either at home or had packed up and moved out of the city people are really really scared people are panicking
3388728 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
3388729 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
3388730 the russians have lost more than 50 tanks and we have shot down 11 of their planes they have enormous damage in terms of manpower
3388731 the georgian forces are not retreating we move our military according to security needs
3388732 the russians dont look kindly on the military cooperation of israeli firms with the georgian army and as far as i know israelis doing security consulting left georgia in the past few days because of the events there
3388733 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3388734 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3388735 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3388736 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3388737 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names
3388738 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty incredible accomplishment
3388739 democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time
3388740 i looked at her and didnt even have the heart to tell her that i had to leave
3388741 so we finished the day out i took her home and explained it to her she could live with it
3388742 the good thing about this defense is its not loaded with stuff
3388743 even the first time i came out here to san francisco in march i was impressed
3388744 i was impressed with the coaching staff it reminded me of the coaching staff i had when i first got to buffalo out of free agency
3388745 we used to challenge each other in practice to see who could get the most picks
3388746 im definitely excited i feel that he can definitely contribute and help us as a team
3388747 but he deserves that hes actually playing the same position that i was when i came into cincinnati a lot of the calls are for willis side of the defense the weak side at the same time the ted has a lot of opportunities to make plays too if there is a play out there to be made im going to make it but ill tell him meet me at the ball
3388748 takeo is a great football player and a good addition to this team
3388749 it turns out well all be better for it hell push me ill push him if my role changes from defense to special teams then ill embrace that
3388750 its always the speed limit when im on the field
3388751 right now weve got three guys that can win but all three of them are fighting for the job
3388752 because of the rotation that we have right now thats the way it is
3388753 every year in training camp in most cases and on most teams defense is always ahead of the offense
3388754 they have all been telling me what a huge achievement winning gold is i realise that but frankly the enormity of the goodwill generated has caught me by surprise honestly enough it really has not changed me i am still the same abhinav who just a day ago was hanging around alone in my room in the olympic village frankly all the attention is a bit overwhelming i am not much good at making loud public pronouncements that in no way means that this is not the most intense experience of my life
3388755 for more than a decade now my life has been all about my sport
3388756 i would like to reiterate that everyone who represents india at the olympic games has put in years of toil and sweat i ask the indian people to support our athletes more it is fine to celebrate our achievements but it is just as important to keep up the backing when we are not on top of our game
3388757 it is important for india to do better at olympic sport as these are the true measure of a nations sporting depth i wish more private initiatives come up with corporate support apart from the backing of the government the joy that the nation feels at my win is humbling i just wish that this is repeated more and more often
3388758 yeah yeah yeah india won gold in shooting in beijing olympics todays performance in chicago was tops but nothing could top this news
3388759 i was absolutely thrilled to see bindra receiving the gold and i had goosebumps when indias national anthem began playing what a moment my congratulations to bindra for his achievement he has done india proud and given us all a moment to celebrate
3388760 at this time i cannot help but remember the reaction of certain people across the country when india had lost a cricket match tournament and people began attacking the homes of various players how easily we forget that our sportspersons are trying their best they too want to win they are the ones who have worked day and night and are certainly more upset than we the supporters are at that time instead of standing by them in their moment of loss and dejection we attack them

3388817 this is of course based on the wild assumption you have two sparking synapses to begin with
3388818 average winter bee losses due to poor weather and disease vary from between 5 and 10 so a 30 loss is deeply worrying this spells serious trouble for pollination services and honey producers
3388819 we dont know why there is a difference and what is behind the high mortality
3388820 30 fewer honeybee colonies could therefore cost the economy some 50m and put at risk the governments crusade for the public to eat five portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day
3388821 we are working with the uk bee farmers association and are sponsoring research to the minimum value of 25 000 over the next 12 months to selectively breed a hardier bee that can better withstand parasites and diseases
3388822 we do not deny that honeybee health is at risk frankly if nothing is done about it the honeybee population could be wiped out in 10 years
3388823 research is vital into varroa bee breeding and the nosema parasite
3388824 we are talking about food security and world food supplies being put at risk
3388825 significant public funds are already provided to support this area of work but to ensure this intervention is effective it it vital that work is driven by a well thought out strategy agreed by all relevant parties

3388831 the excitability of the market does make for some big deals on unfinished material
3388832 there follows a lunch with the authors witty agent at the ivy and it can sometimes come as a bit of a hangover for the author to remember that this tremendously commercial premise has to be slogged into a book if a writer suffers a block after banking the cheque its not unreasonable for publishers or film companies to want their money back in due course
3388833 this agreement with ucb demonstrates biofocus dpis flexibility in meeting client needs
3388834 this innovative deal structure allows ucb to progress their program externally while applying the specific project expertise that ucb has already built internally
3388835 ucb is delighted to be able to work with biofocus dpi in this way combining our expertise to advance this programme towards development
3388836 this initiative is a logical next step in the companys efforts to capitalize on its strong base of innovative development programs and intellectual property that is focused on the treatment of cardiovascular disease as well as diseases caused by a wide variety of lipid enveloped viruses our hdl therapy program has achieved important clinical and pre clinical milestones with the completion of a successful safety and feasibility clinical trial at the washington hospital center in washington d c combined with powerful in vivo and in vitro data supporting the anti atherosclerosis and anti inflammatory design goals of the companys lead hdl mimetic peptide candidate lsi 518p we have built a broad and strategic portfolio of intellectual property assets covering all of our development programs which we believe will provide significant value to a potential partner or acquirer
3388837 the excellent result from this trial reaffirms that the 400 mg bronchitol dose being used in the phase 3 trials is optimal for its clinical effectiveness we look forward to the results from the ongoing phase 3 studies and to bringing bronchitol to the market as rapidly as possible
3388838 we are pleased to have met our primary endpoint for improvement in cfa with trizytek and this achievement is a major milestone for our company the outcomes were driven by the strong positive data from the 26 centers in the u s where we will be initially seeking approval upon completion of our long term safety studies
3388839 our overall top line results were affected by a marked difference between patients within the u s and outside of the u s although we have not yet analyzed individual patient data on aggregate patients from 3 out of 6 non u s countries did not appear to show a difference between trizytek and placebo groups
3388840 we are currently investigating possible factors that may have affected the results outside the u s and upon completion of the investigation we will report the findings moving forward we have requested a pre nda meeting with fda to discuss these results and we remain committed to driving trizytek toward commercialization
3388841 the data are very compelling and the results from the cf centers in the u s confirm the phase 2 study which was conducted solely in the u s during my 20 years of treating cf patients i have seen significant advancements in patient care and trizytek is a good example of an innovative drug that has the potential to enhance nutritional outcomes which are strongly correlated with pulmonary status
3388842 trizytek has the potential of being formulated for young children and other patients who cannot swallow capsules
3388843 we are very encouraged by the trizytek efficacy data because this treatment will offer important new benefits to cf patients who need enzyme replacement therapy
3388844 currently the dosing regimens for enzymes can be a challenge for patients the one capsule per meal dosing for trizytek will help drive better compliance and therefore enhance long term patient health outcomes since 2000 the foundation and altus have worked together toward a goal of bringing this new treatment to the market the data reported today reinforces our business model of supporting highly innovative therapies for cf patients
3388845 the trizytek clinical program demonstrates our commitment to advancing novel enzyme replacement therapy options for both cystic fibrosis patients and others who suffer from pancreatic insufficiency due to the uncertainties with therapeutics that contain animal derived ingredients we believe there is a need for new products that are derived from recombinant technology such as trizytek i would like to thank all of the investigators study coordinators dieticians patients and patient families who participated in this trial in addition i would like to acknowledge the cystic fibrosis foundation for its continuing support reaching this milestone was a great group effort by all parties involved
3388846 viread will be an important new treatment option and its approval represents a significant step forward in the fight against chronic hepatitis b
3388847 the approval of viread for hepatitis b represents more than a decade of work in both the fields of hiv and hepatitis b to develop a medication that offers significant viral suppression once daily dosing and a well established safety profile
3388848 we extend our thanks to the investigators and patients who participated in the clinical trials that support todays approval and we look forward to partnering with community members to increase disease awareness and expand access to treatment for those patients in need
3388849 although weve made great strides in reducing the overall incidence of chronic hepatitis b in the united states the disease still takes a devastating toll in asian american communities
3388850 greater public awareness and effective new treatment options are urgently needed to help reduce this significant health disparity

3388861 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh christ came who is over all god blessed for ever amen
3388862 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
3388863 what then are we jews better than they gentiles no in no wise for we have before proved both jews and gentiles that they are all under sin
3388864 well repentance is when i wake up and i decide to look at things differently and i see that much of my life was counter productive and it is not good to yell at my wife and kids or to drink or not practice safe sex and i see how the bible can help me get my life straightened up and make me successful and healthy and lead what is called a victorious life
3388865 well i got caught and now others know when i am a shame before men
3388866 i feel bad because of what it did to me
3388867 i see god as my creator whom i have not honored in my life i see god as the one who gave me life and breath and i have not returned the love and praise which is due to him i see god as the law giver whose holy law i have spurned i see god as the judge in whose presence i must stand in the last day and to whom i must give an account and i have not honored him or given praise to him i have lifted up my hand against him
3388868 i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day

3388946 i am the light of the world whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life
3388947 i dont mean to be a dick but i could do that work sleeping i have done some amazing work for a company i know longer work for so i dont have the examples im only saying that you would have to do a lot more difficult work in order to get a job doing so believe me ive tried i wish i had examples or time to show you maybe i can if you need some help i may be inclined to help ive been doing this all my life
3388948 if youre good at what you do never give it away or do it for free
3388949 its just a grind you are here for a month and you are on lockdown you get here about 7 30am and leave at 10 or 10 30pm its a long haul if you feel like you want to live forever just go to training camp because thats how it feels its a necessary evil to wear everyone down and then get them ready i guess i just hope to come out of it healthy and knowing this defense inside and out
3388950 i looked at her and didnt have the heart to tell her i had to leave so we finished the day out took her home and explained it to her
3388951 the first time i came out to san francisco i was impressed
3388952 i was impressed with the coaching staff it reminded me of the coaching staff i had when i first got to buffalo that really turned me on
3388953 i was just waiting to see where the best opportunity was it really wasnt about money for me i wanted to come somewhere that id have the best opportunity to win ive been playing 11 years now im trying to at the minimum get to the playoffs and then we are going to win it all in the super bowl so i felt that san francisco was the best place for me
3388954 i had to take some of the reps off but everything came together for a first day though theres a lot of catching up i have to do but other than that putting the time in and getting acclimated with some of the guys
3388955 those guys stayed in my ear about coming here all through the summer
3388956 i met him then but we grew up in the same area in georgia so im familiar with him ever since he was a young pup out of high school
3388957 i knew that was his number that was part of the reason i chose that number when i came out here because it was available
3388958 i have so much respect for him i looked up to him growing up
3388959 its always the speed limit when im on the field
3388960 thats the way i look at it i got it when i first came in and ive been attached to it ever since then
3388961 patrick is coming in at the same position as i was in cincy and a lot of the calls are for that side of the defense the weak side and hes sitting right there
3388962 at the same time the ted has a lot of opportunities to make plays too they are out there to be made do i just sit back and bide time and at the end of the day think hes got this play hes got it made and everything nah if theres a play out there to be made im going to go out there and make it or i tell him meet me at the ball i always tell guys meet me at the ball
3388963 as far as final product or do you mean todays practice todays practice you can read into it yes for the practice
3388964 there will be a practice this afternoon therell be one tomorrow and well see how it goes alright
3388965 because the rotation that we have right now thats the way it is thats what were doing
3388966 no no decision has been made im confident that we have three guys and were kind of repping them thats all i have to say on that
3388967 you know every year in training camp in most cases and on most teams the defense is always ahead of the offense it shows in preseason games you see the scores theyre always low and i think thats what you saw a little bit of today as well as as youre all well aware of and ill point that out is the receivers that are in there isaac bruce isnt practicing and neither is bryant johnson and some of those guys that would clean it up sometimes arent in there that affects the different guys its training camp and where you are typically as well as there are guys that are nicked up
3388968 im concerned about every aspect of the football team its important that we have a very good offense weve got a good structure youve got to go through a process to get where you want to be like any other race you do youve to go through a process to get better were going through that process working at it the lack of consistency in whos out there practicing is what everyone faces and were facing a little bit of this its a normal thing you work through it it gives some guys that normally wouldnt have reps like josh morgan is a great example if that was a healthy crew he probably wouldnt have gotten as many reps as hes gotten so far because of it in the short period he looks like hes going to make us a better football team we would not be sitting here even discussing that or me even mentioning it had he not gotten the reps in some cases it helps you identify someone and in other cases as were well aware of its not as good of a thing you want your front line guys to be playing more
3388969 hell still be one a day practice with this afternoons practice and then on wednesday those are the only two remaining and hell just go on one on both of those hell practice on the one a days he wont play much in the game this week but he could suit up and get a few reps
3388970 we work against each other in a training camp practice and we basically work against an opponent for the other practices obviously the other team is not here to do it but the other team shows it to them so ones a show team and ones the other
3388971 yes exactly the type of practice might be a training camp structure but itll be a one a day but i havent decided that yet it will all depend i would guess that im not going to do it because i think that the offense is going to want to get into what theyre going to see during the season weve got a little more volume than some teams we dont do a couple of things that some teams do so we might just want to take a look at that
3388972 yeah we do we talk about it quite a bit so probably if i seem tired of you guys asking the question its not just you we meet on it a lot we talk about it a lot we look at the film and we study it so if i get a little short im short inside too
3388973 no were not ready i dont think thats the best thing for our football team as time approaches i know that everyone gets anxious but we are getting work done the way it is and because of that i dont have a problem with it if you do have one guy and you know it obviously you give him about two thirds of the reps and the twos get the other ones but in our case we dont know were going through the process
3388974 until we name one we dont right now weve got three guys that can win but all three of them are fighting for the job
3388975 he will work with the second group as he did today in practice in the game i believe greg manusky will probably limit his calls so that the second group doesnt do a lot of the volume that we have on the defensive package standpoint hell probably just keep it pretty simple so that he can play thats probably it wed like to get him in we dont want to wear him out either because he hasnt been in training camp hes been working out
3388976 yes just as ive been studying the roster and where were trying to strengthen ourselves and all that was it
3388977 derek smith was experienced last year too i think that every player plays better the better the guy is next to him if that player is just a freelance player next to him and makes a lot of plays i dont know that it would be good for patrick because hes a more disciplined guy but he makes a lot of plays you need to have discipline for everyone i think that anytime you have a good player next to you it helps you because if he takes those blockers you get to run with the ball more freely
3388978 i just looked a little so i dont know i really didnt want to look at him too much because there are some other things i need to look at hell show as it goes
3388979 you want to win so whatever it takes to win when its more equally distributed it means you have a better team and a better defense i remember with ray lewis he made a lot of the tackles there at baltimore too but one thing about his position is that he will typically make more than anyone else because of the position he plays if he was a corner and a great corner then he wouldnt make as many plays because people dont go to him but hes the middle linebacker and therefore just by design alone hes going to make more plays than most guys a pass rusher for example thats a great player who wouldnt have the numbers of a big guy he might have more sack numbers but in the tackles he wouldnt
3388980 we do need depth and special teams for us is an advantage a year ago id like to have seen us win a game because of it although we were very good i dont think we ever pulled that off jeff is an outstanding special teams player too so well have to see how this works the more depth you have at linebacker typically makes for a better special teams group and hopefully this creates a little bit of depth for us so these guys dont get exhausted just playing base

3389000 we have been making impressive 3d movies but live transmissions bring their own unique challenges like every live show theres less time to make corrections and no room for error one of the big challenges has also been how to keep the parallel signals in perfect synchronisation thats a special challenge over satellite links where atmospheric conditions can be problematic to do this we have developed a solution where we multiplex the 3d signals into a single 2d signal for transmission at the receiving end we then un wrap the 2d signal back into a 3d picture we have done this before but not over such a long link and internationally we have also developed the twin camera systems that will be capturing the images in this case we will be using two camera rigs to show that 3d pictures can be cut and mixed live

3389038 i have deliberately and consciously written respectfully about islam and mohammed i envisioned that my book would be a bridge builder
3389039 might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
3389040 we felt an obligation to take these concerns very seriously

3389091 the media focus was on tom daley most people didnt know who blake was
3389092 somewhere along the line the reality of the situation was going to hit home
3389093 its a typical partnership they finished eighth and had high hopes of doing well and the emotion came out
3389094 the fact he daley has a partner who is 26 there are going to be differences
3389095 to us it was good because we can say right what did you learn from this with the world championships next year they are going to be so much better
3389096 i spent an hour and a half with both of them yesterday monday evening i can assure you its a happy camp
3389097 tom and blake were on good form and they are looking forward to regrouping and looking forward to the future
3389098 sometimes things are said in the heat of the moment which shouldnt be said out in public im sure blake in hindsight would have decided to act differently
3389099 they are frustrated and upset about their under par performance both of them admitted they werent at their top of their game

3389103 tom is fine he was upset all this was kicking off but they are friends as always

3389142 oh god i dont want to have kids for like 10 years i still have a lot to do i dont even know if i could handle a dog right now im so not ready someday ill be a mom but not until im in my 30s
3389143 the voice is the voice of jacob but the hands are the hands of esau
3389144 please save the last bit of trueness in our children
3389145 they think yang peiyis smile is not cute enough what we need is truth not some fake loveliness i hope the kids will not be hurt this is not their fault
3389146 but now that i no longer am in the industry i can freely speak my mind on captives no vested interests
3389147 one of the main reasons we originally moved into the x86 processor business was because we believed that ultimately the third party chipset market would disappear and we would need to have the capability to provide a complete platform that has indeed come to pass
3389148 this does raise a question for corsair and their team is this supposed to happen is the bond between the memory chips and the pcb supposed to be weaker than that between the memory chips and the heatsinks
3389149 this is the first of several new identifiers to come as different products launch over the next year
3389150 intel will include processor model numbers to differentiate each chip

3389156 the murder of christopher was a senseless and needless loss of a young mans life
3389157 i already have a savior what i need is a president
3389158 if the state decides not to honor this grant thats going to amount to 1 4 million in the county and 252 000 in the special tax district well have to send out a separate tax bill to the taxpayers who are affected and that will cost an additional 9 000 to 10 000 in unbudgeted funds
3389159 we granted everyone and his cousin tax breaks last year so i would expect some of those issues would be addressed before we looked at putting the burden on the back of the taxpayer
3389160 i really dont see this rescinding the tax credit happening
3389161 the governor has said hes contemplating such a move so it could take place
3389162 he could call the state fiscal affairs committee together to address a budget matter like this so its possible but frankly its not very probable
3389163 such a move could do to the state republican party what the bush administration has done to the national republican party
3389164 the people here need to know if there is an increase in taxes it will be coming from the state not the county the city or the school board
3389165 when the bill comes from us a lot of them are going to assume were taxing them
3389166 i would think that certainly the reverse of that would be the case if the credit is rescinded the taxpayers should know that that would come from the state
3389167 this could have a direct impact on a lot of people
3389168 if the credit is not rescinded it becomes a moot point
3389169 in no time flat the money theyre asking us to put in 304 344 will come back to the taxpayers
3389170 its difficult to do because no new apartments have been built in albany in the last 15 years and none of the existing complexes have changed hands
3389171 the people here need to know if there is an increase in taxes it will be coming from the state not the county the city or the school board
3389172 when the bill comes from us a lot of them are going to assume were taxing them
3389173 we like to say that there are 11 million pairs of eyes to ensure good government in ohio
3389174 if this trend holds in the near to medium term we believe investors will view it as a positive
3389175 the scale is small yet the achievement within the given constraints is immense and humane a compelling model for the world at large
3389176 the denver police department has a history of over reliance on the contrary to the public interest language
3389177 its overused its used in situations where its not legitimate
3389178 its just having a great plan in place and really literally praying that people dont get too crazy and theres no kind of terrorist events

3389186 i have to work hard im not going to be bigger than a lot of guys so i have to be really physical and play hard to the whistle and be willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done
3389187 we have not taken anything out because jakes out fouch can do everything we have in and hes ok with that hes not jake mobility wise but he can move pretty well and hes pretty crafty with his feet
3389188 theres no way of telling how do you tell if a guy is playing for himself i dont think thats a fair comment to be honest i just dont see that and if i did see it i wouldnt tell you if i had a problem with someone id walk up and tell him thats how id approach it
3389189 im very proud of what ive done and although i didnt medal today i can look back on my whole career and say way to go
3389190 id have a hard time running somebody from the program whos doing that well
3389191 aim at nothing and you will successfully achieve your goal
3389192 once again has been thrown out there like a large matzah ball with no proof or even reference to other research that proves this
3389193 this agreement is tremendously significant at a time when the political authorities in israel and palestine and the international community are failing to find just and lasting solutions to the political impasse it means that the pgftu will be able to ensure much more effective representation for palestinian workers while those working for israeli employers will also benefit
3389194 the agreement calls upon the ituc and its affiliates to continue to support future cooperation and we are fully committed to do this
3389195 this removes a key obstacle to future cooperation and the full respect of the rights of palestinian workers decent work is a foundation stone for political and economic justice and we will now be in a position to devote even more attention to tackling the appalling state of the palestinian economy and playing a fuller part in the quest for justice fairness and democratic rights in the building of a palestinian state
3389196 we are very pleased that this agreement has now been reached
3389197 every worker whether of israeli palestinian or other origin must have full rights to the protections offered by international labour standards the outcome of our dialogue with the pgftu can only help achieve this and help lay the foundations for future cooperation between israeli and palestinian trade unions and progress in our shared quest for justice peace and prosperity for all in the region
3389198 there is simply no way that we can balance the budget before the end of the year without laying off city employees
3389199 services to our community and those that need it most
3389200 they have to balance their budgets and theyre doing it on the backs of the citizens
3389201 it is a very sad day in the city of duluth
3389202 city employees are the lifeblood of our organization and this action will be a terrible blow to the organization
3389203 im glad my opponent has come around to my position
3389204 republicans will use the drilling issue to hammer us in november

3389208 but i dont want to lose my small town way of life
3389209 its unfortunate in a lot of ways that people didnt have the vision to think about conservation of that property when it might have been an easier option
3389210 if we vote no ginn is either going to leave or hes going to renegotiate with us
3389211 a lot of stuff that could be putting money in the citizens pockets rather than the towns pockets
3389212 no matter how deep you dig or how shallow you go you can find a benefit for everyone

3389232 if you love the free trade agreements that have destroyed manufacturing in indiana and if you love the record budget deficits dumped onto our children to deal with then youll love the approach and people mccain is surrounding himself with
3389233 the fact that so many people including republicans are opening up their homes to host events in support of sen obama in hamilton county shows that his message of change in washington is resonating
3389234 this mccain event demonstrates that he is not doing well in hamilton county which does not bode well for a statewide success the notion that they have to bring in someone for support shows that voters here are tired of the failed bush policies and that the mccain campaigns message is not carrying in hamilton county
3389235 tous les voyants sont dans le rouge ce qui ne peut que renforcer nos craintes dune tr s mauvaise surprise pour la croissance du deuxi me trimestre
3389236 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
3389237 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
3389238 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
3389239 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
3389240 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
3389241 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
3389242 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
3389243 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
3389244 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
3389245 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
3389246 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
3389247 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
3389248 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
3389249 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
3389250 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
3389251 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
3389252 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
3389253 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
3389254 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
3389255 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
3389256 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
3389257 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
3389258 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
3389259 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
3389260 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
3389261 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
3389262 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist

3389265 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
3389266 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
3389267 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
3389268 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
3389269 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
3389270 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
3389271 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
3389272 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
3389273 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
3389274 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
3389275 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
3389276 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
3389277 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
3389278 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
3389279 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
3389280 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
3389281 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings

3389332 i saw a lot of him when i was manager of derby and he was at nottingham forest
3389333 he transferred to derby in the summer and i had him watched
3389334 i think he will give us a different dimension he is a boy with a lot of ability he is a naturally left sided winger and maybe we have lacked width in the squad
3389335 i spoke to the boy and he was keen and enthusiastic to join the squad

3389358 the one thing that i wish we would have done is just out publicly say look those are our kids and were gonna support em because theyre still our kids thats what i wish we would have done
3389359 and im not sure that we did i dont think we did a good job of that
3389360 i know i am probably stepping on toes when i say this but it was absurd
3389361 i wanted someone to step up for mike pressler the former lacrosse coach forced to resign last april and those kids
3389362 that we cannot have blind faith in the durham police and the durham district attorney to administer justice
3389363 must now shake the perception whether legitimate or not that it simply washes its hands of its students when they are in legal trouble
3389364 stated dpd policy to punish duke students more severely than other members of the community
3389365 based on evidence that would not stand up in court
3389366 well now we can send brigade combat teams to georgia
3389367 would not have assisted her in recovering from her injuries
3389368 the reason for that is although i support the principle of giving consumers better information fuelwatch will have the unintended consequence of squeezing out independents
3389369 the benefits are unclear the government hasnt released any modelling to show whether there would be benefits
3389370 under fuelwatch they have to set their prices for 24 hours if they make a bad call they cop it and lose sales
3389371 if you are an independent with just one or two or three outlets your ability to manage that risk is much more limited than coles or woolworths who have hundreds of outlets
3389372 i joined a couple of apartments together and did internal non structural refurbishment
3389373 every single person who did a refurbishment had the sign off from the executive committee of the owners corporation which was acting on best advice and in good faith
3389374 i am happy to comply with whatever rules and regulations are appropriate and anything the council now puts forward i dont think any resident would say anything to the contrary
3389375 there is a lot of anger in the building about the amount of noise and dust from the work the fact the lifts are used by builders and that the building managers and concierges spend too much time chasing after workmen to be able to do their jobs properly
3389376 major work including removing walls subdividing and consolidating apartments generally requires council consent to ensure correct safety amenity and construction processes are followed
3389377 works undertaken without first gaining council consent can be subject to fines and orders requiring the works to be rectified and can require development applications be lodged to seek consent for ongoing uses
3389378 pier 6 7 is in the walsh bay wharves precinct conservation area which is listed on the state heritage register this means that development consent for most works is also required from the heritage office
3389379 i dont have all the details but yes we have all the approvals
3389380 works have been going on for more than a year and i have had to live underneath it the whole time
3389381 bruce has been encouraging people to sell their apartments so they can be amalgamated with other apartments
3389382 wed been told there would be more amalgamations and that wed just have to cop it
3389383 all i wanted to do was find a way we could have some peace between renovations then i suppose i started asking the wrong questions
3389384 neither i nor anyone else at dynamic wishes to remove the chair of pier 6 7 we have no reason to want to do so and my actions are totally motivated by compliance with the law and the best interests of the scheme
3389385 even if the same person owns apartments on both sides of a common property wall that wall is still common property

3389412 shiseido ensures highest level of business security and continuity with lumension security
3389413 before establishing polices and implementing lumensions solution to enforce them we were constantly chasing fires that were spreading across all four of our u s sites nearly every day we were dealing with a different worm or virus that made its way onto our network most of which were the result of un patched vulnerabilities in our operating systems
3389414 with lumensions solutions were able to quickly proactively assess and eliminate all known vulnerabilities and contain any malware through the cost savings on it staff resources alone we were able to achieve roi in just three months

3389416 additionally we are able to react to issues more quickly which is as important as any quantifiable roi figures lumensions vulnerability management suite gives us a more security centric view of the network allowing us to gain greater insight into the network and a better overall view into the system we are able to more rapidly adjust to changes in the business making our it operation much more proactive and flexible and therefore more productive

3389476 barring some last minute leger demain at the polls by republicans the democrats are expected to sweep the fall elections
3389477 the desire to have it all and the illusion that we can is one of the principal sources of torture of modern affluent free and autonomous thinkers
3389478 some philosophers have argued that the very open endedness of human appetite is responsible for both our savagery and civility since a creature that could conceive of eating anything including notably other humans stands in particular need of ethical rules manners and rituals

3389482 we sat up in the computer lab and said we cant believe theyre writing this stuff we always knew at the least that we would be a team that would be in position to be looking at a medals podium

3389515 i recognize that people across the commonwealth particularly retirees on a fixed income are facing difficult economic times
3389516 however i returned an earlier version of this legislation expressing concern about adding significant costs to the commonwealths already large unfunded retirement liability
3389517 we were taking a certain amount of risk hindsight being 20 20 we underestimated the priority the governor placed on his amendment

3389573 net als ajax hebben alle grote topclubs in europa selecties met heel veel spelers
3389574 soms betreft het zelfs dertig of vijfendertig spelers voor het eerste elftal niet iedereen heeft dan evenveel kans om te spelen toch zie je daar nooit dat gelouterde spelers van naam zoals kenneth perez worden teruggezet naar een jeugdelftal
3389575 het terugzetten naar een jeugdelftal is een stap te ver de coach mag en moet keuzes maken maar de club zorgt voor een waardige oplossing
