3240001 expressing its deep concern with the situation the conflict zone
3240002 unfortunately the information we get from the battle arena proves that the russian federation which played a mediatory role for a long time in the conflict settlement is turning into its party
3240003 discuss with the georgian authorities concrete measures to stop the military confrontation
3240004 the state of ukraine which has been supplying weaponry to georgia so that it got armed to the teeth and with that directly encouraging the georgian authorities to start the intervention and ethnic cleansing in south ossetia has no moral right to tutor others and seek to participate in the settlement
3240005 we know that kiev sold several amd systems to tbilisi among those there could be the s 200 systems
3240006 has the right in accordance with the international law and the law of ukraine to forbid the ships and vessels that may take part in a conflict to return to the territory of ukraine till the conflict is resolved
3240007 i cant tell you anything about the mechanism of the entrance denial
3240008 you should take it seriously ukraine makes no secret it can easily side with your opponent
3240009 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3240010 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tblisi

3240018 these are reform agendas we would like to see start they can conclude even beyond the term of the president
3240019 in the bigger picture federalism for the whole country it may require a constitutional convention
3240020 it can happen after the term of the president or before the term expire personal assessment ko my personal assessment is that we can start electing constitutional convention delegates sabay sa at the same time as 2010

3240027 what can one say for the people who have continually re elected silver
3240028 the most important thing is the fact that in 36 of the states women are doing better than they were in 1997 and by better i mean as a comparison of the percentage of women in leadership posts compared with the percentage of women in the state
3240029 if a woman had 10 years that she stayed at home with her family a traditional assessment would have been that she did nothing in those years
3240030 my assessment was different because i know when i was home with my kids i was active in the schools and community organizations and of course you learn a great deal from bringing up children
3240031 its the faas position that santa monica lacks the authority to ban any aircraft at the airport
3240032 i think news just becomes a less distinct category you dont sit down with a newspaper or even a news website or even a super wireless e paper device for 10 minutes in the morning to very formally get your news rather you get all sorts of news and information from the personal to the professional to the political throughout the day in little bits and bursts via many different media with any luck in 5 10 years the word news will be sort of confusing dont you just mean life
3240033 in reality the only possibility of avoiding such a crunch appears to be if a major recession reduces demand

3240035 alter current recommendations that hormone therapy should never be used to prevent heart disease
3240036 the risk of stroke was elevated regardless of how many years had elapsed since menopause
3240037 this is an important and meaningful analysis for women who can benefit from hormone replacement therapy
3240038 given the powerful effects of estrogen therapy in relieving menopausal symptoms we believe that physicians may safely counsel women to use estrogen for the relief of menopausal symptoms
3240039 there is still not a good scientific basis for assessing the drugs safety in all patients but we can say if there is an increased risk for a heart attack it appears to be a relatively small risk

3240049 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
3240050 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
3240051 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
3240052 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
3240053 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
3240054 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
3240055 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia

3240083 de kosten toch zon 5 000 euro zijn ten laste van hen hopelijk stemt dit tot nadenken en geven ze ons de kans om aan te tonen dat het hier geen speelplein is of dat hier geen dertig tot veertig kinderen zitten die de boel afbreken als er hen toch iets op de maag ligt dat ze dan eerst naar mij toestappen om het te bespreken in plaats van meteen juridische stappen te ondernemen

3240086 we hebben dus een echte tweelingenpiek gehad want normaal bevallen bij ons zon negenhonderd mamas van wie acht van een tweeling als het zo doorgaat hebben we dit jaar dubbel zoveel tweelingen als vorig jaar
3240087 bij een vruchtbaarheidsbehandeling is de kans groter op een meerling maar geen enkele van deze babys was het resultaat van zon behandeling
3240088 tweelingen komen voor bij n op de zeventig zwangerschappen daarom vind ik acht tweelingen in een jaar eigenlijk niet eens zoveel
3240089 dat het er nu opvallend meer zijn dan de voorbije jaren kan verschillende oorzaken hebben vrouwen krijgen hun eerste kind gemiddeld op latere leeftijd oudere vrouwen maken een hormoon aan dat vaker voor tweelingen zorgt jongere vrouwen maken dat hormoon ni t aan

3240094 when we talk about having a par level of performance across all three platforms it is nigh impossible to define that for a pc user i have no idea what gpu ram cpu or soundcard you have or even which os you are running so saying that the pc is a lead platform well what does that mean in terms of how much ram we have to use

3240100 we decided to take about a week and work the knee strengthen it get the swelling down and get him back after the game
3240101 you need at least two good backs to get through an nfl season
3240102 im looking forward to his return to see how good a duo we could be
3240103 thats what training camp is for i know im rusty i know im not going to come to training camp and be on point thats hard and ive got to work to that level
3240104 the offseason program that we implemented here they cant make it mandatory that you be here but you need to be here to learn whats going on willis wasnt here so hes playing catch up you have to be in great shape in this offense
3240105 right now hes going to struggle a little bit until he understands what were asking him to do if he wasnt the athlete that we all know he is it would be frustrating it still is kind of frustrating because were trying to teach him and its just not coming as fast as you would like it to but you know it will come
3240106 coach matsko has this mentality that everybody on the offensive line is a starter
3240107 so thats how youve got to prepare yourself and be ready to go they give me a lot of confidence
3240108 i feel ready whenever im called upon im going to be ready to go
3240109 hes got a lot to learn a lot of technique things posture assignment target footwork but he competes when a guy competes like that whos got a lot of athletic ability hes got a chance to be good
3240110 i just like to play physical and i like to finish
3240111 thats why im trying to get better and thats what im trying to bring to this offensive line
3240112 everybody out there is being physical its intensity at the end of the day you forget about it because its just a game but when the whistle blows
3240113 i usually tick a lot of people off and they try to fight me hopefully they lose their focus thats part of my game plan
3240114 you do a lot of running in soccer and it helps with my footwork and how i run
3240115 i came to this country to get an education and play soccer
3240116 once i started playing football i fell in love with the sport
3240117 i like everything about it when you get mad at yourself or someone else you can take that aggressiveness out and its legal i have a lot of fun with that
3240118 my mama wasnt happy at first because she didnt want her baby to get hurt
3240119 once she saw that i was getting bigger she figured i was eating well and would be safe
3240120 they taught me the value of hard work and what it can do for you
3240121 hes a pretty strong physical player and you can tell he wants to be good
3240122 i think you just have to give him time and hes going to be a good player
3240123 he probably needs to get a little stronger but the tools are there
3240124 hes a worker hes got the right temperament hes a nasty player
3240125 you can get yourself in trouble on the way down to the ground though
3240126 were all brothers so you pretend like it didnt happen you just laugh about it
3240127 we laugh about that stuff later when we watch the film
3240128 theres no ill will there its just something to break up the monotony theres no hard feelings
3240129 when guys are competing at full capacity tempers do flare up everyone wants to go home and theres a lot of testosterone around here its part of the game
3240130 you dont carry it over though you get in a fight in practice and you dont take it off the field maybe you go and have lunch with the guy its just something thats understood
3240131 the thing i like is we had a little skirmish out there and the offense got right back to the line and ran a play
3240132 its not like youre going to say to guys dont fight they understand that theres really not a lot of value in it
3240133 tempers are going to flare guys are competing guys went back to work
3240134 that didnt provide us with the opportunity to test the security arrangements we will explore whether we would only use karachi and lahore
3240135 we want to see whether that would enhance the security situation for us at those two venues and it may be decided that we would not use pindi at all it is not finalised but it is a strong possibility

3240158 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3240159 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3240160 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

3240162 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3240163 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3240164 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

3240171 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3240172 until now our ability to represent the high latitude oceans and sea ice in oceanographic and climate models has suffered as a result
3240173 if we want to understand whats going to happen to climate in the future we need to know what the sea ice is going to do will there be more or less and will it form more or less rapidly
3240174 they measure temperature and salinity as a function of depth as they dive down and up through the water column

3240230 we will look at the draft and try to bring it to a standard where it can play a role in this
3240231 in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country
3240232 we have to go to the shelter because there are russian planes flying over the presidential palace here sorry
3240233 at the moment our troops are pushing out capturing and disarming groups of georgian law enforcement agencies which have been surrounded in the capital of south ossetia

3240247 every time he seemed like he was ready to be able to do this he had a setback
3240248 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3240249 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3240250 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3240251 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3240252 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3240253 theres a huge window thats open and i do believe theyve got to close that
3240254 the new security proposals must be workable and should strike the right balance between the need for security and for mobility
3240255 weve worked very closely with industry to garner as much input with respect to what is operationally feasible
3240256 provide a standard of security for a community that doesnt have one right now
3240257 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3240258 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3240259 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3240261 life moves pretty fast if you dont stop and look around once in a while you could miss it
3240262 your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life dont be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other peoples thinking dont let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition they somehow already know what you truly want to become everything else is secondary
3240263 we cannot change the cards we are dealt just how we play the hand
3240264 faith in something greater than ourselves enables us to do what we have said well do to press forward when we are tired or hurt or afraid to keep going when the challenge seems overwhelming and the course is entirely uncertain
3240265 ive got to make up a lot of ground for the start i had the last time
3240266 tonight i stayed focused on what the plan was and executed my pitches thats pretty much the difference from being good and being horrible

3240272 we always take into account what the goyim will say
3240273 i dont care what the goyim will say i care about the security of the citizens of israel do you think the pictures on cnn matter to me as much as the children and their fears and the residents of sderot and ashkelon who have abandoned their homes no way

3240307 my wife is on edge from the moment i leave home until the moment i return

3240309 people are giving them the benefit of the doubt for now
3240310 the worry is that what seems like a passing phase might become a way of life
3240311 it is a jihad because this individual should not be given the chance to destroy the countrys political stability and prosperity

3240313 i dont really see how we can recover from this
3240314 langsomt men sikkert er markedet ved at indstille sig p at den langvarige dollar nedtur siden 2000 er bragt til ende det er et fundamentalt skifte vi er vidne til lige nu og vores bud er at vi vil se stigende dollar i de kommende r frem
3240315 it was formed 10 years ago by a bunch of students from york university we all sang in a student jazz choir there after we graduated we decided we wanted to continue singing together people really liked our first show which sold out
3240316 its more challenging than other types of singing its more rewarding theres something empowering about being able to make music with only your voice
3240317 he was an example of the types of vocalists we aspired to at the time harmony sweepstakes international competition in new york city in 2003 the next level of the competition was in san francisco in which we placed third
3240318 the police would definitely be among my favourites everybody in the group has a different favourite a different experience of what 1980s music meant to them i like groups like the police and paul simon others prefer cyndi lauper xtc and michael jackson
3240319 probably the drums i often act as the vocal drummer in the band with vocal beat boxing people often think of things like hip hop sounds versus rock or jazz sounds we incorporate some public enemy in our oldskool repertoire we have a medley that covers our favourite dances and hip hop pieces

3240324 las jorobadas han mostrado la habilidad de recuperarse significativamente de una caza muy intensiva
3240325 toma alg n tiempo para los conservacionistas establecer la suficiente confianza como para llegar a la conclusi n de que es una verdadera se al de recuperaci n y no una variaci n de corto plazo

3240327 creo que es muy importante recalcar que la lista roja no tiene nada que ver con que ciertas especies pueden ser nuevamente explotadas
3240328 often contain repeated patterns such as bricks tiles and windows
3240329 our goal is to exploit the tremendous sharing of imagery features both within individual images and across collections of images
3240330 for instance building fa ades often contain repeated elements such as windows and bricks and multiple images often reveal the same surfaces only just slightly deformed
3240331 our approach is to factor these elements efficiently so as to represent them only once
3240332 in a sense our technology can be seen as orthogonal to traditional image compression such as jpeg
3240333 while jpeg looks for correlation at a local scale in the image such as areas of constant color we look for correlation of features at large scales

3240347 the entire bay area is correcting for the frothiness in the markets that occurred from 2003 to 2006 where by all rational economic accounts the market was outpacing what youd normally expect to see

3240349 areas of overbuilding have very steep price declines but on the coast and in areas where there is still significant employment growth prices are holding up because demand is stronger
3240350 that shows you the roller coaster ride in san francisco and how now youre coming down to more historically normal levels
3240351 you can see how exuberant the san francisco area got over the past eight years and as the winds were taken out of the sails as the market peaked what that looked like it was a more gentle decline from 2005 to 2007 then more precipitous declines beginning in early 2007

3240366 that kind of stuff is still happening but to a lesser extent
3240367 the fact were having this debate of who has to pay more because someone else is paying less is symptomatic of the many deep flaws in our health care finance system

3240372 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3240373 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3240374 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3240375 we saw it as a tool to help us with retention and recruitment
3240376 this definitely is something that has helped with our stature in the community and with our competitiveness
3240377 executives realize that if employees are stressed out financially have excess debt it really makes them less productive

3240408 clare decided to call it a day and certainly stated very publicly that i was the next leader of the party some couple months before that and certainly this election a third term for labor was always going to be hard to win
3240409 i certainly think our base was cranky at the government for a number of reasons
3240410 i certainly think that some people dont like going to the polls early and that could have played a part
3240411 i still believe that we are more likely to secure the inpex investment with a labor government but i do concede that some people did not think that was a good reason
3240412 we work with whichever party forms government and are more than happy to do so
3240413 the government is really lucky to be back in office
3240414 many aboriginal people voted labor in the federal election because of what john howard and mal brough did to us with the intervention
3240415 but in the last 12 months neither the new rudd government or nt labor have done anything to reverse these destructive policies
3240416 no one had any confidence in this election people think why should i care

3240456 cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multidimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war confrontation with communism
3240457 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
3240458 the use of force plays a role but may be less important than measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
3240459 iraq and afghanistan remain the central fronts in the struggle but we cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multi dimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war confrontation with communism
3240460 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
3240461 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies

3240539 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3240540 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3240541 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3240542 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3240543 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3240544 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3240545 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced

3240584 historically presidential nominations were decided at the party conventions and as a result the vice presidential running mates were also selected at the conventions gallups jeff jones notes
3240585 that made it difficult to disentangle the effect of naming a vice presidential running mate on a candidates support from the
3240586 the small window of time after the announcement of a presidential candidates running mate but before the convention has taken place
3240587 similar to the pattern seen with clinton in 1996 support for gore held steady during bushs vice presidential selection phase at 41 percent

3240603 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3240604 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3240605 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3240606 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon

3240609 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
3240610 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3240611 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3240612 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3240613 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3240614 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3240615 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3240616 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3240617 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3240618 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3240619 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3240620 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3240621 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3240622 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3240623 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3240624 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3240625 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3240626 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3240627 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3240628 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3240629 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3240630 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3240631 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3240632 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3240633 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3240634 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3240635 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3240636 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3240637 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3240638 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3240639 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3240640 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3240641 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3240642 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3240643 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3240644 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3240645 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3240646 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3240647 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3240648 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3240649 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3240650 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3240651 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3240652 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3240653 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3240654 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3240655 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3240656 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3240657 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3240658 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3240659 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3240660 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3240661 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3240662 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3240663 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3240664 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3240665 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3240666 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3240667 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3240668 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3240669 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3240670 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3240671 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3240672 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3240673 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3240674 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
3240675 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3240676 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3240677 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3240678 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3240679 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
3240680 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
3240681 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
3240682 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
3240683 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
3240684 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
3240685 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
3240686 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
3240687 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
3240688 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
3240689 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
3240690 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3240691 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3240692 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
3240693 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
3240694 it should also be an inspiration for more of our youth to take up sports as a fulltime career
3240695 pakistani troops lobbed 60 mm mortars and continued with small arms fire at the poonch indian post from 12 30 p m to 1 30 p m this afternoon
3240696 if you look at the history of how cities are developed in canada neighbourhoods are situated right next to industries
3240697 that happens across toronto and in most cities in canada you will have that nearby arrangement which is why the community has a right to know what chemicals are being stored and used in those facilities
3240698 we know that propane facilities within 1 6 kilometres is the danger zone which is why people were asked to evacuate their houses within 1 6 km
3240699 i think its a reasonable thing to work from that kind of distancing perhaps its less than that but i think its an entirely reasonable thing and thats what ive asked city staff to do
3240700 we need to have them located in remote locations where theyre not butted up against residential housing
3240701 ensure an incident such as the one we saw yesterday does not
3240702 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3240703 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3240704 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3240705 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3240706 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3240707 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3240708 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3240709 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3240710 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3240711 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3240712 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3240713 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3240714 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3240715 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3240716 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3240717 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3240718 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3240719 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3240720 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3240721 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3240722 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3240723 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3240724 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3240725 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3240726 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3240727 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3240728 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3240729 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3240730 sting was conducted sanjeev saxena who reportedly brought the cash to the residence of bjp mp ashok argal and sohail hindustani who reportedly accompanied the three bjp mps to mr amar singhs residence
3240731 a sudden feeling of fear or anxiety that comes on suddenly is overwhelming appears to be uncontrollable and may seem to be unfounded
3240732 the greens were really soft and my putting was really good
3240733 i have had a good experience this year but i dont want to do it again its really stressful
3240734 to get to play with the top players in the world is ultimately the goal
3240735 im just so excited i want to get out there on the lpga tour its just a matter of getting out there and playing with them and getting the experience
3240736 its just that going back its going to be a little fun ill just have to tell my teachers im going to be a little late
3240737 i actually want the country to see who i am who i truly am
3240738 a string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication
3240739 never in recent journalistic history have so many tough reporters so closely resembled sheep
3240740 i think every single candidate for president republican and democratic have lives personal lives that indicate something about what kind of human being they are
3240741 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3240742 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3240743 investors are getting excited about the prospects for alliance global
3240744 the government has been pushing tourism as a future growth area
3240745 we believe in the vision of making the philippines one of the best tourist destinations in asia and together with our partner star cruises we will make this happen
3240746 we are exploring the possibility of bringing in the tourists aboard star cruises ships as our way of reviving the interest in cruising the seas and making our visitors experience a different way of entering our country
3240747 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3240748 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3240749 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3240750 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3240751 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3240752 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3240753 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3240754 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3240755 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3240756 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3240757 we met today and the talks were inconclusive we will meet tomorrow again
3240758 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3240759 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3240760 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3240761 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
3240762 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3240763 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3240764 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3240765 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3240766 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3240767 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3240768 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3240769 only hope was left within her unbreakable house she remained under the lip of the jar and did not fly away before pandora replaced the lid of the jar
3240770 sadly to date the public outcry has yet to yield a fair and reasonable lithuanian response if anything it seems that the harmful phenomenon of historical revisionism and distortion of which the investigation of the jewish partisans is a prime example may actually be increasing in your country in light of this severe and continuing problem yad vashem calls upon you to intervene directly and restore lithuanias integrity as an enlightened and democratic nation by ending the misguided investigations only by dealing openly and forthrightly with the full and complex truth about the past will your nation succeed in building for itself a secure and stable future
3240771 yad vashem will continue to welcome and teach lithuanian educators about the events ramifications and legacy of the holocaust thus reflecting and communicating our core commitment to the truth we shall continue to support these teachers admirable attempts to strengthen true democracy in your country and hope that they remain steadfast within an increasingly inhibiting atmosphere that they can now sense around them
3240772 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3240773 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3240774 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3240775 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3240776 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3240777 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3240778 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3240779 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3240780 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
3240781 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3240782 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3240783 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3240784 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3240785 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3240786 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3240787 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3240788 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3240789 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3240790 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3240791 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3240792 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3240793 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3240794 just so you all know we did set a record
3240795 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3240796 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3240797 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3240798 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3240799 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3240800 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3240801 empire of debt the rise of an epic financial crisis
3240802 the honest truth is that we have too many people in washington living for today rather than saving for tomorrow
3240803 give americans a good talking to about the countrys sloppy debt habits
3240804 the american people are a lot smarter than people give them credit for
3240805 comment by bruce in miami august 8 2008 at 9 54 am

3240807 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3240808 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3240809 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3240810 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3240811 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3240812 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3240813 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3240814 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3240815 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3240816 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3240817 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3240818 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3240819 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3240820 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3240821 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3240822 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3240823 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3240824 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3240825 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3240826 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3240827 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3240828 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3240829 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3240830 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3240831 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3240832 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3240833 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3240834 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3240835 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3240836 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3240837 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3240838 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3240839 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3240840 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3240841 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3240842 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3240843 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3240844 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3240845 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3240846 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3240847 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3240848 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3240849 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3240850 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3240851 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3240852 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3240853 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3240854 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3240855 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3240856 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3240857 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3240858 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3240859 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3240860 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3240861 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3240862 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3240863 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3240864 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3240865 well we are not going to reprint all of them just because of one little error paper is far too expensive
3240866 i keep hope because i dont want to believe the other side of it
3240867 in my mind im still keeping up because i dont want to lose that hope im hoping theres someone in the country who knows where he is
3240868 im just looking everywhere and pleading for someone to help my son and find him
3240869 not at all not at all i dont think about that part of the park i know the police officers are trying to do their best to try and wipe out all the doubt because it was pretty cold and i dont believe he would be going there
3240870 the place he tries to go to is the childrens corner in the park theres a swing and slide and he used to go there and hes very fascinated by all these things
3240871 were just hoping this feeling wont last forever were just waiting for our son to come back to us
3240872 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
3240873 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
3240874 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
3240875 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
3240876 to implement a tribunal to deal with off field offences against society committed by its players
3240877 players averaging more than 200 000 a year cant expect to earn that without giving up some sort of rights
3240878 we are talking about a small number of players you would be hard pressed to find more than a dozen cases in recent years
3240879 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3240880 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3240881 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word

3240913 there is nothing in the available data that indicates that the introduction of variable fees in england has yet had any lasting impact on the level or pattern of demand for full time undergraduate education
3240914 whilst it is encouraging that student numbers have not decreased in our universities it is extremely worrying that there has been no change in the number of students from the very backgrounds the government is spending considerable sums of money on persuading to apply
3240915 we remain unconvinced that asking students to pay more for a university education is the best way to encourage those from poorer backgrounds to apply

3240948 at first the notion seems alarming a gangster movie cast entirely with kids especially when we learn that bugsy malone isnt intended as a kids movie so much as a cheerful comment on the childlike values and behavior in classic hollywood crime films what are kids doing in something like this but then we see the movie and we relax bugsy malone is like nothing else its an original a charming one and it has yet another special performance by jodie foster who at 13 was already getting the roles that grown up actresses complained werent being written for women anymore she plays a hard bitten nightclub singer and vamps her way through a torch song by paul williams with approximately as much style as rita hayworth brought to gilda she starts on stage drifts down into the audience arches her eyebrows at the fat cats all about junior high school age and in general is astonishingly assured and her performance seems just right in the film bugsy malone depends almost totally on tone and if you put kids in these situations and directed them just a little wrongly the movie would be offensive but its not and its especially right with foster it tells a gangster story we know almost by heart about the tough new gang that wants to take over the territory da boss known as fat sam a kid named john cassisi who looks like he was born wearing a carnation in the lapel of his pinstripe recruits hired guns to help protect his turf bugsy malone scott baio in training for john garfield is the guy hes gotta have but maybe even bugsy cant help because the other gang has a dreaded new weapon in al capones day it was machine guns in bugsys movie its marshmallow guns they open up on you with one of these and you got more than egg on your face old fashioned weapons like custard pies are useless in a one on one situation halfway through bugsy malone i started wondering how anyone ever came up with this idea for a movie alan parker who wrote and directed it claims his inspiration came while he was watching the godfather i dunno i think the movie has more insights into kids than into gangsters when kids play its real thats one of the things we lose when we grow up the ability to turn the backyard into the o k corral the kids in bugsy malone dont behave as if the material is camp or a put on for them its real especially the indignity of catching a marshmallow in your ear and so in an uncanny way the movie works as a gangster film and we remember that the old bogart and cagney classics had a childlike innocence too the world was simpler then now its so complicated maybe only a kid can still understand the bogart role

3240998 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3240999 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3241000 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3241001 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities

3241008 i dont know how it was arranged or what level of hospital this was but it supports the idea that the world of athletics is very aware of gene doping and already pursuing it
3241009 there are interesting preliminary results but i cant expand on that
3241010 but were all encouraged by the results and wada very much wants to be ahead of the curve on this and has funded a dozen or more labs on gene doping
3241011 this is all very subjective but the hope is that it will be a fair process that will allow the athlete who has had gene therapy for legitimate reasons to state his or her purpose for it
3241012 the sporting authorities can then either accept or reject it
3241013 if gene doping is happening already as we suspect its being done unethically and with immature

3241082 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3241083 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations

3241112 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3241113 you are surely not from france or from italy how come youre on this plane
3241114 norasida wanted to join us because he said he could no longer tolerate the non existence of democracy practice in umno for instance the quota system for party elections
3241115 he said he prefers to work for the people not only for the malays

3241119 past records wont count now sony is a very tough attacking player i know his game well but this may change for the olympics here so i have to make sure i am in the best condition to face him

3241135 im pleased that procurve is trying to add additional components to the product side
3241136 when youre talking wireless its definitely in every conversation were having today
3241137 being a procurve partner and presenting a procurve solution and you dont have 11n youre dead in the water
3241138 its a technology space we felt we needed to own
3241139 we will be creating demand for them and giving them a broader set of solutions
3241140 this will definitely be a great move and a great way for us to have a strong wireless offering without just key components
3241141 this is a great segue to get into new markets with them
3241142 i think procurve was heading in this direction already and this helps them leapfrog to where they were going
3241143 this acquisition is going to speed this up for procurve and for me
3241144 i expect procurve will take this product line and add in the wire line security components that other wireless vendors are missing
3241145 we will look at the opportunities out there in the market and understand how it impacts our customers
3241146 what this does is strengthen the portfolio strategy we already had were not moving away from our network edge strategy
3241147 rfid technology has yet to truly mature if resellers can educate themselves quickly enough there are huge rewards to be had
3241148 previously we saw rfid as a low level opportunity but it has exploded and we are looking at some big projects
3241149 rfid had its hype curve and people are now getting practical about deployments

3241151 our technicians have been using acronis for a while and found that their solutions are powerful reliable and extremely easy to use when asked to recommend backup and recovery solutions by our customers we made the decision to introduce acronis products and make them available for our customers to purchase through our technicians
3241152 being the expert in the backup and recovery space we understand the needs of smbs and home users and we provide products specifically designed for them at an affordable price we hope that geeks2u customers will benefit from the most advanced imaging technology from acronis while they enjoy the high standard services from geeks2u

3241155 i told him that all i had here for him was a dh if he did not want to accept that do not accept the trade
3241156 im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3241157 platoon is when you have a left hand hitter and a right hand hitter one plays against right hand pitching and one plays against left hand pitching that is a platoon
3241158 anybody that has a brain knows thats not a platoon
3241159 there was no one specific reason behind the split during a review of distribution model we saw that 3com and westcon were heading in two different directions over the next three five years
3241160 as we continue to refine our local and global strategy it is important that we align our portfolio around key vendors that are both synergistic with our core competencies and deliver consistent growth and profitability for westcon group and our channel partners we wish 3com all the very best for the future
3241161 there wont be any changes to our channel model 3com still operates on an indirect sales model
3241162 we are looking to grow our enterprise customers and investing in a direct touch sales program
3241163 we are looking at evaluating our distribution model and we are looking at all other distribution models there are many types of distributors and we are looking to find the one that meets the needs of our partners
3241164 its all about the model we use whether its through multiple or single distributors
3241165 we are always on the lookout for leading it security technologies i have been following up progress with breach security an agreement was negotiated at rsa 2008 event in san francisco in april and the deal was signed in july

3241167 our forces on the ground are withdrawing from the conflict areas so we expect fighting to end by tomorrow wednesday

3241180 the fearsome mexican drug cartels allied with paramilitaries and guerillas are winning the war against their colombian equivalents and now run the multi million business from ecuador
3241181 other assassinations were recorded since dawn yesterday in various parts of the country according to figures from the national police the daily average of homicides up to july is 8 7
3241182 in the first seven months of 2008 at least 90 000 mexican children have been deported by the us government in its anti immigrant policy with the consequent separation of thousands of families
3241183 the children are left in the charge of human smugglers to bring them to the us with their parents and in that intent they are deposited and practically abandoned on the mexican border since their family for fear of deportation does not reclaim them
3241184 there is disdain by the us for these children and there doesnt exist a program of support for them on the part of the mexican government
3241185 georgians are a fantastic people and i love them and to see them time and time again go through war i think its terrible

3241191 mmp as we have discovered to our cost swings the pendulum so far in favour of the representative part of the equation that it has crippled the government part
3241192 the conservative pragmatism of having an electoral system that more often than not delivered a national victory without winning a majority of the popular vote
3241193 believe there is any purpose in railing against it today
3241194 i will write the detail of this at some stage in the future
3241195 overall her policies added to those of sir roger douglas and the fourth labour government generated a big improvement in productivity growth which is now accepted generally as the only sure eventual route to a high wage economy
3241196 large numbers had their standard and quality of living indecently reduced
3241197 presumably the other option would have been to deny the public the right to have a say in how they wanted to be governed
3241198 the head of government of any country large or small must be well informed on a daily basis on international affairs and on the countrys primary foreign policy and economic trade interests

3241214 at the school level the syllabus keeps getting updated students learn about the latest developments in all fields but in college the material is the same not having been updated for a long time
3241215 the aim is to update the syllabus at regular intervals probably every two to five years
3241216 the introduction of the financial analysis paper in the curriculum has increased the chances of a maths graduate getting a good job in the corporate world instead of going for just research or teaching the same goes for physics
3241217 at the end of the day a student has to be convinced that all the hard work he is going to put into a subject will fetch him a good career
3241218 once you go abroad you realise the lacunae in the education system with students from other countries alongside you realise that you dont know a lot of latest developments new research and the like
3241219 the curriculum development committee for each discipline will constitute teachers of that particular field who will look at incorporating the latest data and updating the syllabus of the subject

3241224 i am very happy that people from all over the world are addressing the needs of the underprivileged in india in committing time and resources to social and environmental needs businesses and non governmental organizations can play a key role in sustainable development i commend conergy and the lodge elysium masonic trust in their efforts to reach out to indias underprivileged communities this act of commitment dedication and compassion is both inspiring and also a role model for environmental leadership we need to do more and i ask more organizations and businesses to follow this example
3241225 it has been extremely fulfilling for conergy to be a part of this initiative
3241226 through our subsidiary suntechnics we have already installed several hundred renewable energy systems for environmentally friendly solar power and thus improved the living standards of more than 100 000 people in 250 indian villages till now more than 13 of the 600 000 remote villages in india lack electricity like dewri gowada most are located in remote territory which proves expensive and technologically challenging for power supplied through a public grid off grid renewable energy products such as solar powered home and street lighting systems thus serve as affordable and efficient alternatives while also environmentally friendly
3241227 indias potential for renewable energy projects far exceeds the current installed capacity of the current 144 913 megawatts of energy produced in india only 8 4 comes from renewable sources this equates to 12 195 megawatts
3241228 the narmada project saw kbl faced with a never before seen technological challenge with a combination of research innovation and team work combined with the best of breed cad technology of ptcs pro engineer kbls engineering division was able to successfully overcome this challenge
3241229 the most significant result of this project has been the enrichment of the lives of thousands of people living in over 4000 drought affected villages in the area while also lowering operating costs of the system
3241230 we are pleased to be a part of this social initiative with kirloskar brothers ltd with the successful completion of the saurashtra branch canal project ptc has reiterated its commitment to providing best in class solutions that not only address the business needs of our customers but also enable them to overcome unique technological and innovation challenges
3241231 we are particularly proud to be associated with a project that has such a major impact on the lives and livelihood of thousands of farmers
3241232 as an olympian myself i know firsthand that an athletes vision and visual skills are critical tools both on and off the field
3241233 vision is a critical component of overall physical health that makes a large contribution to overall performance after having worked with a number of elite athletes i am surprised how many are not seeing as well as they could at this level of competition an athlete should not be squinting to focus on a ball a hurdle or a teammate on the field if you are not seeing well your reaction time is slower and that may impact your overall performance
3241234 when you are training an elite athlete every aspect of their health and physical skills should be assessed and if possible improved it is critical that every athletes vision is clear and that their vision is helping not hindering their performance
3241235 scientific advances like the achievevision tm program offer new techniques to help our athletes perform at their peak we have incorporated the achievevision tm program at general administration of sports of china to allow eye care professionals coaches and trainers to customize vision care for each athlete and focus on the visual skills that are key to their competition
3241236 were honored to be entrusted with the vision care for the olympic athletes and team staff while they are in beijing
3241237 through the olympic village polyclinic johnson amp johnson vision care will provide the athletes access to best in class vision care services and products to help them maintain visual health during competition for some athletes who have limited access to vision care services this may be their first opportunity to receive eye care and diagnostic services which can have a significant impact on their everyday lives

3241241 each man lives his life building a house as he lives his life what do we base our lives upon
3241242 the heart of the 1960s counterculture was not accepting the status quo but rather questioning authority figures and the political norm such as the federal government in order to find greater truth and meaning in life
3241243 we took education out of the christian home where it had raised up men and women who were god fearing christ honoring bible loving people

3241249 in this case it was not the police that were setting mr read up to entice mr read to come over here to have sex with what he thought was a 15 and a 17 year old girl
3241250 in my experience ive never encountered this where an estranged wife has been the one that set up this sting
3241251 he acknowledged that he came over based on the text messages that were sent to him to have sex with a 15 and 17 year old girl
3241252 weve seen a sharp decline not only in attacks but in foreign fighters traversing the western nineveh deserts
3241253 but the population is feeling more secure every day he said adding that rebuilding the infrastructure and finding jobs are the number one topics discussed on the streets of the city
3241254 the iraqi police and army are becoming more capable and the extremists are being pushed into the rural areas because of this
3241255 last week both iraqi army and u s military units entered several rural towns where al qaida had intimidated farmers for the past few years
3241256 these are places where security forces had not been there were beheadings we knew about those and murders and criminal behaviors in these towns in rural diyala
3241257 rigged with numerous explosive devices which could have killed soldiers or worse young children
3241258 we were having a conversation about when he would like to have the province turned back over to him and i gave him a date
3241259 he actually thought later than what i said as the date potentially to turn over salahuddin province and theyre the ones right now with the least amount of problems with security they have the least number of attacks of the four provinces in the north
3241260 iraqi security forces and the coalition forces are partnering very well that theres still work to be done in terms of the economic and the government line of operations
3241261 we are the most volatile area in iraq right now but were continuing to pursue terrorists so that isnt the case in a few months
3241262 being able to hear whats happening outside the vehicle is very important
3241263 without that youre not putting yourself in a strong position to respond more safely
3241264 we strongly suspect that wearing earphones will present a safety challenge to drivers in particular situations but there needs to be that evidence in place before legislative initiatives are considered
3241265 that tends to immediately cut you off from the acoustic world around you
3241266 no se descartan intensas y abundantes lluvias r fagas y ocasionales ca das de granizo pudiendo afectar al norte de esa zona durante la madrugada del martes

3241272 parents may want to have enough communication with child care providers about when what and how to feed their babies during their stay in day care which is important to avoid potential risk of overfeeding or underfeeding at home
3241273 a major factor in this increase has been the change in cheerleading activity which now involves gymnastic type stunts
3241274 if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading
3241275 the prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide and this epidemic is accompanied by a high incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease
3241276 in conclusion we provide evidence that a metabolically benign obesity can be identified and that it may protect from insulin resistance and atherosclerosis
3241277 furthermore our data suggest that ectopic misplaced fat accumulation in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity
3241278 among u s adults 20 years and older 23 5 percent approximately 16 3 million adults of normal weight adults were metabolically abnormal whereas 51 3 percent approximately 35 9 million adults of overweight adults and 31 7 percent approximately 19 5 million adults of obese adults were metabolically healthy
3241279 these data show that a considerable proportion of overweight and obese u s adults are metabolically healthy whereas a considerable proportion of normal weight adults express a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities
3241280 further studies into the behavioral hormonal or biochemical and genetic mechanisms underlying these differential metabolic responses to body size are needed and will likely further the identification of possible obesity intervention targets and improve cardiovascular disease screening tools
3241281 both reports emphasize the benign nature of fat accumulation outside the abdomen
3241282 in both studies the detrimental effect of visceral fat accumulation and its surrogate waist circumference were clearly demonstrated confirming older studies showing that waist circumference is a risk factor even in normal weight individuals
3241283 we voted you as the bn candidate why now you join the pr

3241289 have an immediate and positive impact on the economy and enhance the esas effectiveness
3241290 provides some useful insight into the current state of affairs in the industry even with the margin of error in mind the housing downturn has had a major impact on nuca members and increasing water infrastructure investment would very likely prompt new purchasing and create jobs
3241291 the stimulus is nice if there is an actual upturn in sight
3241292 the construction market will be bleak for at least two years and you must have revenue to justify taking on greater debt regardless of increased expensing opportunities
3241293 we need to stimulate the infrastructure economy and the government should be spending the money in infrastructure not giving a tax deduction to the few companies that have work and already have all the equipment they need
3241294 like all good mayors they were trying to be fiscally responsible
3241295 many contractors probably waited to take advantage of the depreciation bonus until late 2002 when their year end financial situation was clearer and the benefits of using the depreciation bonus to reduce tax liability were more concrete
3241296 the 2000 2001 downturn was in large part attributable to a dramatic drop in businesses purchasing
3241297 in early 2002 when congress first created the depreciation bonus the economy had suffered six consecutive quarters of declining business purchasing
3241298 the u s economy has experienced nine consecutive quarters of declining residential real estate investment this has taken a tremendous toll on the construction industry given the slowdown in the housing market it is not surprising that construction companies are reluctant to invest in new equipment
3241299 celebrate the wonderful boy my brother was and the life he has had
3241300 we will all be there to get through it and will share the memories doujon would like us to share

3241303 the buses pass within a foot of each other on the t way and theres nowhere for cyclists or pedestrians to go
3241304 its only a matter of time before someone is killed
3241305 i keep hope because i dont want to believe the other side of it
3241306 in my mind im still keeping up because i dont want to lose that hope im hoping theres someone in the country who knows where he is
3241307 im just looking everywhere and pleading for someone to help my son and find him
3241308 not at all not at all i dont think about that part of the park i know the police officers are trying to do their best to try and wipe out all the doubt because it was pretty cold and i dont believe he would be going there
3241309 the place he tries to go to is the childrens corner in the park theres a swing and slide and he used to go there and hes very fascinated by all these things
3241310 were just hoping this feeling wont last forever were just waiting for our son to come back to us
3241311 if we can demonstrate that the ridge is part of the north american continent the danes can use that information to show it is also part of greenland
3241312 they can use it to define their outer limits to the east and we can use it define outer limits to the west and we both benefit
3241313 this allows canada to establish its outer limits once and for all
3241314 that gives canada the exclusive rights to develop the natural resources on and below the seabed in that area
3241315 polizei und soldaten haben versteinerte gesichter sie erschrecken die ausl nder in peking man sollte etwas tun

3241318 shes not going to be allowed to come here like she did before
3241319 obviously one of my husbands favorite stores so a couple of years ago when we saw the sign for a new store on our way home from visiting our grandchildren in pa we decided to take a little side trip and pay it a visit

3241323 the enforced detention of russian citizens in georgia is an unacceptable situation and in complete violation of international law
3241324 in this incident the positive and proactive initiative of the atc controller who on realising that mobile audio communication from the pilot was intermittent quickly switched to texting his instructions instead
3241325 this contributed to the safe resolution of the incident and for such the controller should be commended for his actions
3241326 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
3241327 i found that to tell the truth is the hardest thing on earth harder than fighting in a war harder than taking part in a revolution
3241328 the folks at deutsche bank nyse db told clients to get out of commodities they say china is slowing the
3241329 in fact my philosophy going forward would be that we would entice far more people into the third level sector
3241330 that is a core principle of our party he added
3241331 and i will continue to make my views known there
3241332 it was a very foolish position for him to articulate when clearly theres no support around the cabinet table for it he will be quite badly damaged when all the dust settles
3241333 students have always fought to defend free education if the government tries to introduce fees they will have a fight on their hands
3241334 i could only see legs and uniforms the bodies were trapped only the legs were visible
3241335 a roll over transportation incident where the passengers are unrestrained
3241336 hey dad why do we have to do this i mean other people take a real vacation i just spent the week with paul and his family they were really on vacation and we just work
3241337 besides if you add up all the expense of maintaining this place it would probably be cheaper for us to take a vacation somewhere else somewhere where somebody else paints the shutters
3241338 if you added up the cost of maintaining this place its probably a lot more than a nice vacation
3241339 we had to replace the roof a few years ago we have damien the gardener who keeps an eye on the place we had to have the plumber come and fix the furnace you put a new door on the kitchen it must cost a lot of money we could have gone to spend a month in a nice hotel on the cote dazur for example
3241340 oh and i was surprised by how much people hate parisians
3241341 they think parisians are rich and snobby and theyre right you know pauls father would see someone with paris license tags doing something stupid and hed roll down the window and yell out go back to paris or something like that
3241342 but wait pauls family is from paris they are parisians
3241343 yes but his father got local license tags so when hes on vacation he pretends to be from the area and yells at the parisians
3241344 but we had a good time sailing it was nice to take a real vacation not like around here we never get a vacation here because theres always so much work to do just to keep the place from falling down really dad i dont see the point
3241345 sentimental reasons henry this isnt an investment and its not just a vacation spot this is our home weve spent the last 13 years fixing it up weve restored it weve planted trees and gardens and you children have grown up here
3241346 besides our lives are otherwise rather nomadic i work in london your mother and edward live in paris you children are spread out all over the world youre going to be in virginia next year maria is out in los angeles we need a place to call home a place to keep our sacred family documents
3241347 you mean a place to keep grandmas recipe for bread pudding and maryland beaten biscuits
3241348 yes and your monkey outfit from when you were in the school pageant we need a permanent family stronghold a family seat a place where the whole family could gather every summer
3241349 well why didnt we just stay at the family farm in maryland
3241350 because my business took us to europe and because the whole area changed so much with all those shopping malls and housing developments it didnt seem like home anymore we had to retreat
3241351 well i dont mind that i like this place i just dont like having to work all the time were here
3241352 but thats just part of the charm of it imagine if we had gotten a condo at the beach at ocean city wed go crazy wed just sit around and read all the time here we get to do a little stonemasonry in the morning and paint the shutters in the afternoon
3241353 when i grow up im going to get a place at the beach and spend the summer there youre going to have to paint the shutters by yourself
3241354 the folks at deutsche bank nyse db told clients to get out of commodities they say china is slowing the
3241355 price reductions are continuing nationally while there have been reductions in all segments of the market the sharper fall in the price of new houses reflects a more aggressive approach by developers in order to stimulate demand
3241356 we estimate that prices will decline by 12pc for the whole of 2008 although the nature of the monthly declines is proving to be protracted
3241357 nevertheless while the monthly rate of decline eased in june we expect ongoing monthly declines to feature for some time yet given the more stringent credit conditions as well as the large overhang of stock in the market
3241358 youll never achieve perfection but youve got to keep trying to get it
3241359 theres no question digital will overtake physical it happened in music and will happen to our industry
3241360 we have to think about how the consumer is changing and how the ways they are accessing media is changing
3241361 we believe xbox live as the key differentiator in the business
3241362 there has been a significant change in the market as the world is revaluing assets based upon the perceived health of their own economies as it relates to the suddenly stronger us economy
3241363 ive always watched the road to croker its a great show and im delighted that ill have the opportunity to present it on august 21
3241364 just have to clear the head look at the kerry mountains and see what i need to do next
3241365 we dont have a slate of targets but the best buying can be done during a downturn
3241366 over many of these cycles we have put together some of the best parts of our asset base
3241367 some of our competitors are re leveraging at a time when markets are turning down
3241368 theyre doing that off the back of major capital investment for excess capacity in an over supplied market
3241369 on the consumer market we were forecasting 3pc growth over the next couple of years when we wrote the report at the beginning of this year
3241370 we have been hit by rising raw material costs orange juice for example has gone up two and half times over the last 12 to 15 months waste management costs energy costs and the threat of further costs increases with possible levies on beverage packaging

3241372 the task force appears to be fully satisfied with the security arrangements being carried out for the champions trophy
3241373 che cosa ha fatto di male quella donna per essere messa in una cella
3241374 e una indesiderata unemarginata una donna che forse vittima di una tratta e che cerca di vivere o sopravvivere con il proprio corpo e questo in una italia sempre pi intollerante diventata una colpa
3241375 essere poveri sta diventando un crimine e in questa fascia di nuovi perseguitati i pi deboli sono gli immigrati e le donne ci sono troppe lucciole che sono schiave e si vendono sui marciapiedi perch minacciate da chi le ha fatte arrivare in italia
3241376 le retate anti prostituzione continua servono solo a fare impazzire le lucciole che scappano da una citt allaltra o da un quartiere allaltro in cerca di un clima pi tollerante la ragazza fotografata chieder mai aiuto a chi lha trattenuta in quella cella si fider mai delle forze dellordine anche se vittima della tratta non glielo dir e se insieme alle sue colleghe sar cacciata in un cono dombra ancora maggiore ad esempio se sar costretta a prostituirsi in un appartamento non incontrer neppure volontari in grado di spiegargli che pu entrare in un percorso di protezione i sindaci sceriffo stanno cavalcando il tema della prostituzione ottenendo come unico effetto quello di criminalizzare chi avrebbe bisogno di protezione

3241380 since 1884 weve had a roll call vote its a nominating convention not a coronation
3241381 i dont think theres any harm in nominating sen clinton at the convention
3241382 it will acknowledge the success we had and it will give an opportunity for people to express themselves and get behind obama and win in november
3241383 its a simple thing to do and its the biggest sign of party unity
3241384 if we do that one thing the hillary people can get past it and move on
3241385 if the situation were reversed the obama people would feel the same
3241386 for the first time in a generation its been a close election and this was such a unique situation
3241387 sen clinton is going to do everything she can to make sure sen obama is the next president and that will include how the convention is handled and the role she plays
3241388 polls out there show that older women are the potential swing demographic in this election
3241389 it helps obama and the party to have her play a prominent role in the convention
3241390 if a candidates got delegates then both names can be placed in nomination
3241391 are these folks so new to politics are they so arrogant that they think hes different from every other nominee weve ever had
3241392 were democrats were precinct captains were fundraisers were the kind of democrats obama will need to win in november
3241393 i had heard of this going on in other states but im really disappointed this is happening to the courts in our state
3241394 this is a real indication there are two systems one for the rich and powerful and one for the rest of us the public has been left out of this process
3241395 i try to discourage attorneys if the only purpose is that their client paid a settlement and is trying to keep it from the media thats foolish
3241396 if there is no method of tracking this how will the public ever know what is going on
3241397 this is not what our court system is supposed to do justice is better served when it operates in the open
3241398 first and foremost it is worth acknowledging that the demise of the soviet union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century
3241399 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3241400 over 20 per cent of participants in the study showed the high blood pressure symptomatic of hypertension but did not know they had it and were not receiving any treatment
3241401 hypertension is behind nearly 18 per cent of diseases reported in australia yet levels of treatment are low we must better identify and monitor people so we can successfully treat them for this debilitating condition which can lead to so many complications and deadly conditions
3241402 we are particularly concerned at the awareness and management of hypertension in rural australia
3241403 many participants with hypertension were not seeking treatment and for those that were being treated many were not keeping their blood pressure down
3241404 over 40 participants were not even aware at the time of the study they had been identified with hypertension and had been prescribed antihypertensive medications
3241405 we need better education of both patients and their primary carers in the management of hypertension if we are to successfully address this disease
3241406 principally we show that air pollution as measured by particulate matter in smoke or pm10 does affect the health of boys who have problems with asthma although the health impact isnt great there were small decreases in lung function during very high pollution days for boys with asthma
3241407 the majority of students on the other hand who didnt have respiratory problems were not affected however all students coughed slightly more on high pollution nights
3241408 this is the first time that this urine test has been used to detect exposure to wood smoke pollution in new zealand
3241409 another important result which contradicts an urban myth is that you cannot escape the health effects of air pollution by going inside and slamming the door indoors is just as polluted as outdoors
3241410 our tests show there is very little difference in the concentrations of pm10 pm2 5 and pm1 particulates between indoors and outdoors contrary to many peoples belief
3241411 essentially pollution reaches peoples lungs even if they stay inside on high pollution days there is no escape from wood smoke pollution particularly in older wooden houses during winter temperature inversions in christchurch or anywhere else

3241419 parents experience lower levels of emotional well being less frequent positive emotions and more frequent negative emotions than their childless peers
3241420 in fact no group of parents married single step or even empty nest reported significantly greater emotional well being than people who never had children its such a counterintuitive finding because we have these cultural beliefs that children are the key to happiness and a healthy life and theyre not
3241421 if you admit that kids and parenthood arent making you happy its basically blasphemy
3241422 from baby lotion commercials that make motherhood look happy and well rested to commercials for disney world where youre supposed to feel like a kid because youre there with your kids weve made parenthood out to be one blissful moment after another and its disappointing when you find out its not

3241434 the international society should immediately get involved and demand that
3241435 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3241436 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the

3241483 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3241484 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3241490 we are pulling out all the stops to deliver a more efficient package for customers who need the capability of full size pickups and suvs and want the very best fuel economy
3241491 our pickups and suvs are already the fuel economy leaders of their respective segments but our engineers knew greater efficiency was achievable we fast tracked the xfe models to get them into dealer showrooms as quickly as possible
3241492 in addition to the xfe models gm already offers hybrid versions of the tahoe and yukon that achieve up to a 50 percent improvement in city fuel economy and coming in the first half of 2009 are the silverado and sierra hybrids
3241493 these hybrid pickups offer up to 25 percent overall increased fuel economy and greater than 40 percent improved mileage in city driving
3241494 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3241495 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3241511 yes but a conflict can arise if the net effect of people exercising their individual rights is to place an undue burden on others i suppose it comes down to what you think societys obligation is to young people in the type of situation created by the flds its not the dearth of brides im concerned about since youre right that no one is guaranteed the right to marry but the effects of the competition for those brides

3241600 it was really nice of mum and dad to stay away for my sake
3241601 i know his father very well in fact we were together for the athens games dr bindra was very excited at the prospect of abhinav winning a medal and even distributed t shirts to a few to support his son unfortunately abhinav lost by a whisker
3241602 abhinav was with me five days ago he had a minor mechanical problem and i sorted that out quickly there were no physical problems with him but i realised that he was making an extraordinary effort to stay calm to ensure his mind was at peace
3241603 his parents would have definitely been a bit of a distraction but the soft spoken guy that he is i wonder how he must have even told them not to come probably he may have said look mum dad as much as i love you id like you to stay away this time and it worked
3241604 this boy has a very cool head on his shoulders he knows exactly what hes doing
3241605 esta pol tica que no s lo permite sino que ha invitado a mercenarios a incorporarse a los cuerpos represivos del estado dar n continuidad con los secuestros de los que tanto se queja la burgues a mexicana y seguir n asesinando y desapareciendo a los luchadores sociales en todo nuestro pa s
3241606 nuestro pueblo se de cuenta hasta que grado de prudencia tenemos y que esto no se tome como un acto de debilidad o desorganizaci n de nuestro partido
3241607 no muestren a tu enemigo tu camino por donde caminas ni siquiera pises fuerte para que no te escuche
3241608 para que cuando haya una reacci n ante el despotismo de estos tiranuelos no se sorprendan ni se asusten porque las condiciones objetivas est n ya produciendo las subjetivas en las que el pueblo crea sus liderazgos y sus vanguardias para entrar en combate el horno no est para bollos
3241609 the commission recognizes that any increase in customer rates is difficult especially in these challenging economic times
3241610 i think we won some of the key issues in the case at first glance it appears the psc may have split the difference between what the committee was requesting and what the division recommended
3241611 it has a disproportionate influence on the space in terms of its overwhelming smell the cultural idea of it and the operational problems created by the mess it produces im not saying no popcorn is better than popcorn but i am saying there is no way in which it fits with the culturally sophisticated brand i wish to sell
3241612 what abhinavs achievement will do to indian shooting is phenomenal im very happy for him and he deserves every bit of his success because he has worked very hard for it
3241613 people should realise that shooting has a lot to do with luck too
3241614 despite all your skill and composure you also need a lot of good fortune which abhinav enjoyed today unfortunately i didnt
3241615 only yesterday we read in the newspaper about terrorists threatening to damage our games and bogoc has been on high alert since this chaos here only made matters worse
3241616 he refuses to leave india and renders pro india slogans
3241617 both of them are born brought up and trained in karnataka and even played for karnataka for many years they still continue to work in firms in bangalore but when it comes to sports they have chosen other states since they didnt get any support from the state government pramila moved to jharkhand two years ago and shobha moved four years ago
3241618 i have myself happily relieved and given no objection certificate to 13 athletes this is because if india has to get international medals athletes need recognition and encouragement which karnataka doesnt give it is best that they go to other states and bring accolades to the country
3241619 ap and jharkhand give rs 50 000 for a national championship gold medalist karnataka gives nothing athletes need at least rs 600 per day for training whatever little they earn cant be spent on sports alone they need to look after their families too monetary rewards from the government can encourage them
3241620 when they are working they cant travel for three days in train and need to fly but government doesnt pay for flights when they are participating in events like delhi or punjab in summers the heat is extreme but they are given just a room with a fan they cant sleep and hence cant perform
3241621 this has happened for the first time in karnataka sports history i am not sure if this will continue this time we have a good commissioner things can change after a new bureaucrat comes in
3241622 usa and china has already begun preparations for 2012 olympics but here when young girls come for sports they are not even provided with toilets
3241623 overall we found outdoor workers perceptions of their workplaces support for sun protection and other health related behaviours strongly influenced their personal protective behaviour
3241624 to foster a supportive safety climate skin cancer control programmes should also be developed alongside other workplace health and safety interventions
3241625 focusing on the damage that sun exposure causes to the skin and the eyes might help increase outdoor workers understanding of their personal risk

3241628 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3241629 there i wrote about the hojjatieh brand of shiism that ahmadinejad follows which i described as follows
3241630 our revolutions main mission is to pave the way for the reappearance of the 12th imam the mahdi we should define our economic cultural and political policies on the policy of the imam mahdis return
3241631 for additional background on the virulent brand of shiism practiced by ahmadinejad
3241632 on the cair website and see how concerned they are about the pressing issue of kosovar independence the truth is that since albanian muslims are non arabs cair and their wahhabi masters could care less about albania or kosova
3241633 as proof of the damage caused by being named unindicted co conspirator in the case
3241634 but he told me he signed a fatwa condeming terrorism
3241635 do not be fooled when the administration claims it is merely tweaking the law
3241636 the cumulative impact of these changes equals a full blown attack on americas premier conservation law we owe it to future generations to stop this attack and continue our legacy of protecting wildlife on the brink of extinction
3241637 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3241638 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3241639 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3241640 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3241641 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3241642 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3241643 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3241644 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3241645 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3241646 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3241647 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3241648 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3241649 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3241650 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3241651 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3241652 in 2004 when the kuwaiti authorities attacked the radicals the government discovered that the source of the jihadist preaching were the imams associated with the brotherhood
3241653 in my article i discuss the growing conflict between christians and muslims in the country caused by the exponential growth of saudi wahhabi backed mosques all over the country as i mention i witnessed this phenomena first hand
3241654 correlates of public support for terrorism in the muslim world
3241655 the letter im responding to by ahmad al akhras national vice chairman of the council on american islamic relations and columbus resident is
3241656 spencer notes a number of problems in gorskis article which i wont recount here but the ap article mentions the same study cited by al akhras gorski says
3241657 do you personally feel that such attacks are often justified sometimes justified rarely justified or never justified
3241658 24 percent of americans reported in the maryland study who believe these attacks are
3241659 and what am i to make of the fact that according to the university of maryland
3241660 bombings and other types of attacks against civilians are sometimes justified

3241665 baginda hamba harus segera pulang takut nanti ibu hamba cemas bolehkah hamba titipkan nyamuk ini di istana
3241666 tuan raja nyamuk hamba dimakan ayam jantan milik baginda bagaimana jadinya
3241667 kalau begitu ambillah lesung itu sebagai ganti ayammu yang mati
3241668 terima kasih baginda namun hari hamper gelap bolehkah hamba titip dulu nangka itu di istana
3241669 harum sekali bau nangka ini oh aku ingin sekali memakannya pasti bibi di dapur menyimpannya untukku
3241670 kalau nyamukmu ditelan ayam kuserahkan ayam itu padamu kalau ayam itu mati dipukul dengan alu kuserahkan alu itu untukmu kalau alu itu kejatuhan nangka aku juga serahkan nangka itu kepadamu sekarang nangka itu dimakan oleh puteriku ya mau atau tidak aku harus menyerahkan puteriku kepadamu
3241671 ahh saya kan gak pernah serius klo pacaran ngapain takut
3241672 ahh tidak semua cowok seperti itu cowokku ga gitu and ga mungkin begitu

3241674 kenalkan aku tetanggamu jojo kalau mau main tenis meja dan catur kita bisa main di depan kantor rw di situ
3241675 sudahlah mas bungkus saja lagi kan masih ada buahnya yang kecil kecil
3241676 aah itu soal kecil di kampung ini belimbing masak sampai jatuh ke tanah karena tidak ada yang memetik di sepanjang jalan tumbuh pohon pohon belimbing
3241677 mana bisa soal kecil pokoknya kalau orang mengambil milik orang lain itu namanya pencuri pencuri harus dihukum karena melanggar hukum negara dan agama
3241678 satu buah paku pun kalau milik orang lain kita ambil itu tetap mencuri namanya
3241679 sudahlah tak usah ribut kalau mau tangkap pencurinya mas eko tunggui saja belimbingnya
3241680 sudahlah mas eko nanti juga pencurinya bosan kalau mau makan belimbing minta saja ibu beli di supermarket
3241681 belum aku masih mau kenalan dengan si pencuri tapi aku ikhlas karena katanya belimbing itu untuk orang sakit mungkin saja ada orang yang sakit darah tinggi dan tak mampu beli belimbing
3241682 ko aku minta maaf selama ini aku yang mengambil belimbingmu untuk mak ida tetangga kita itu kan sakit darah tinggi aku akan bayar kesalahanku hukum saja aku suruh aku sikat wc bersihkan sepedamu atau apa saja
3241683 selama ini aku pikir mencuri belimbing tidak apa apa kalau mencuri ayam dan barang barang berharga tidak boleh tapi kamu mengajarkan apa yang jadi milik orang lain walaupun itu sebuah paku tidak boleh kita ambil sejak itu aku mulai berpikir mungkin selama ini aku salah apalagi kamu tulis bahwa lebih baik minta daripada mencuri nah kalau minta kita dapat untuk apa mencuri kalau kita bisa jadi orang baik mengapa harus jadi orang jahat

3241699 tidak ada orang yang dapat sempurna dan khusyuk sepenuhnya dalam mengerjakan shalat dai awal hingga akhir
3241700 jika memang kau dapat sempurna dan khusyuk dari awal hingga akhir akan kuberikan surbanku yang terbaik sebagai hadiah untukmu
3241701 dan pada rakaat yang kedua ketika sujud yang terakhir saya tetap khusyuk hingga duduk tasyhud nmun ketika mendekati salam barulah hati saya berubah teringat akan janjimu ya rasulullah bahwa engkau akan memberikan hadiah surbn terbagus milikmu untuk saya maka rusaklah kekhusyukan shalat saya
3241702 sebab khusyuk itu diukur oleh allah seatas kemampuan manusia yng penting ketika pikiranmu terbawa kepada urusan lain cepat cepat kembalikan kepada shalatmu lagi dalam mengerjakan shalat memang hendaknya seakan akan kita mampu melihat dan berbicara kepada allah tetapi kalau tidak mampu asalkan kita ingat bahwa allah meliht kita itu sudah memadai
3241703 tidak lebih cepat dari doa seorang makhluk yang dikabulkan oleh khaliknya
3241704 berapa jauhkah jarak antara masyrik dan magrib atau antara timur dengan barat
3241705 sebab bila kujawab sebelum tidur bagaimana dapat merasakan nikmatnya tidur kalau belum melakukannya atau mengalaminya jika kujawab setelah bangun dari tidur bagaimana akan dapat kugambarkan sesuatu yang sudah lewat sedangkan jika kujawab saat dalam tidur bagaimana mungkin seorang dalam keadaan tidur atau tidak sadar merasakan nikmat atau tidaknya sesuatu karena itu janganlah terlalu banyak tidur hingga berlebih lebihan sebab hidupmu akan pendek meski umurmu cukup panjang bukankah orang yang dapat merasakan dirinya hidup adalah saat mereka dalam keadaan sadar sedangkan tidur sama dengan tidak sadar jadi bagaimana bisa dikatakan hidup kalau bukan orang lain yang mengatakannya
3241706 bukankah engkau pernah mengatakan bahwa kandungn surat al ikhlas atau kulhu itu sama dengan sepertiga isi alquran
3241707 karena itu cukup membaca surat al ikhlas tiga kali itu sama dengan menghatamkan alquran

3241714 look what my mom and dad got me for international youth day billy an ecoman micro bullet rc helicopter its just like the one the real ecoman flies only smaller and real really real
3241715 but wait theres only one ecoman how are we going to decide who gets to play ecoman itd be a shame to leave one of these awesome copters on the sidelines instead of zooming up to 50 feet above the ground
3241716 well maybe we could recreate ecoman versus america from all hero stories 31 may 1943
3241717 oh right the one where hitler creates his own ecoman robot or maybe march of the ecomen when ecoman recruited the boys of ecotropolis to form the ecoman corps
3241718 yeah from ecoman family 17 november 1958 or maybe a pigeon cries in ecotropolis from the ecoman amp black ecoman special winter 1975 you could play the african american sidekick as we bust up that drug house full of nuclear waste
3241719 and theres always beholdeth a dark one riseth from the astonishing ecoman 138 through 144 april october 1979 the saga of dark ecoman
3241720 well no way am i painting my copter purple and setting it on fire id rather play teenage ecobotomy where the new nitrous huffing gay club kid ecoman has to kill off the earlier incarnations of ecoman in his subconscious ill never forget ecoman 1 march 2002
3241721 boy that grant morrison is really something hey you know what the internet says there are like and this helicopter doesnt have anything to do with any of them near as i can tell so really we could play whatever we want
3241722 good i was running out of comics tropes to make fun of

3241727 soon we started a family business which we called mother of eight designs which we knew would help promote the faith and family six of our eight children assisted in reproducing my sculpted products and before long we were selling to stores across the country the highlight of our achievements is the fact that bishop james sullivan r i p of the diocese of fargo personally placed some of our pro life ornaments into the hands of our beloved pope john paul who immediately pronounced a blessing on the edwards family it is evident to me that this blessing has been a big part of the story behind the paintings

3241786 we said from the start that dougie would do the open cup and well stick with that
3241787 hes been a good pro and its good to get him in some games
3241788 its tough when you are behind somebody like matt reis who has been so consistent and obviously has been uninjured
3241789 its been hard for dougie sitting in the wings for so long and he deserves to play in this game if matt does go down or gets injured its obvious that dougie needs games in order to do well if he gets that chance
3241790 i dont know if it will be the same teams as the last tournament or the last mls game but the mentality stays the same
3241791 theres no doubt they will put their best players out there and there will be a mix of players for us its an opportunity for players to step on the field against a good squad
3241792 we are going to take on an underdog role in this ryder cup for the first time in a long time even on paper when you look at the strength of the european squad
3241793 ive said all along that experience while being very important i mean weve lost five of the last six ryder cups so most of their experiences are bad experiences so its not like experience is going to be a great help im looking for guys that playing well its as simple as that and if its an experienced player playing well then i think thats fantastic
3241794 its nice to be known for something good like that
3241795 i look at my uncles and my dad bill and i still feel like theyre 22
3241796 its just like im going to play with my friends now while my friends are in the house playing video games
3241797 when i first came in here there was a lot of oh youre just coming here because of your uncles and all that and they didnt really see what i could do as a football player
3241798 but now i feel like im starting to prove myself ive still got to prove myself more but they do see me as a football player more
3241799 i just wanted to get back out there and compete again as a quarterback
3241800 all through school especially being a quarterback all through high school at natick and coming in as a quarterback you miss it and after i felt i learned this new offense with steve logan i felt i could contribute again and be the quarterback but then again i have been doing a good job at wide receiver and thats my home im leaving it up to them to make a decision
3241801 darren would always tell me growing up that id be a great wide receiver and he knew that i had good hands and when i told him i was going to be a wideout he got all excited
3241802 he wanted to work with me and i took some good information on what to do in certain situations as a wide receiver hes been teaching me up and he got excited because hes been through it he knows what to do and hes been giving me good points
3241803 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3241804 any of the campaigns that would have tried to push that would have been burned by it

3241806 the situation in georgia continues to deteriorate because of the escalation of russias use of military force
3241807 i have spoken to president saakashvili and conveyed my deep regret over the loss of life and the suffering of the people of georgia
3241808 good morning the situation in georgia continues to deteriorate because of the escalation of russias use of military force i have spoken to president saakashvili and conveyed my deep regret over the loss of life and the suffering of the people of georgia for many months i have warned that there needs to be active international engagement to peacefully address the disputes over south ossetia and abkhazia including a high level and neutral international mediator and a genuine international peacekeeping force not simply russian troops no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country russia has escalated its military campaign through strategic bombing and the movement of its ground forces into the heart of georgia there is no possible justification for these attacks i reiterate my call for russia to stop its bombing campaign to stop flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and to withdraw its ground forces from georgia the georgian government has proposed a cease fire and the russian government should accept it there is also an urgent need for humanitarian assistance to reach the people of georgia and casualties on both sides the united states europe and all other concerned countries must stand united in condemning this aggression and seeking a peaceful resolution to this crisis we should continue to push for a united nations security council resolution calling for an immediate end to the violence this is a clear violation of the sovereignty and internationally recognized borders of georgia the un must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world i welcome the visit of the french and finnish foreign ministers to georgia as a first step toward mediation there should also be a united nations mediator to address this crisis and the united states should fully support this effort we should also convene other international forums to condemn this aggression to call for an immediate halt to the violence and to review multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia including russias interest in joining the world trade organization the violence taking place along the black sea is just miles from sochi the site for the winter olympics in 2014 it only adds to the tragedy and outrage of the current situation that russia has acted while the world has come together in peace and athletic competition in beijing this action is wholly inconsistent with the olympic ideal while returning to a pre august 8 military posture is a necessary first step to resolving this crisis we cannot tolerate the unacceptable status quo that led to this escalation that means russian peacekeeping troops should be replaced by a genuine international peacekeeping force georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions going forward the united states and europe must support the people of georgia beyond immediate humanitarian assistance we must provide economic assistance and help rebuild what has been destroyed i have consistently called for deepening relations between georgia and transatlantic institutions including a membership action plan for nato and we must continue to press for that deeper relationship the relationship between russia and the west is long and complicated there have been many turning points for good and ill this is another turning point let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past that is why the united states and the international community must speak out strongly against this aggression and for peace and security
3241809 its certainly hard not to be spooked by the currency and its really hard to know what the currency will do
3241810 its really hard to give guidance its better off not giving any guidance were trying to manage this business over the longer term
3241811 if we had the financial year 2007 exchange rates for financial year 2008 our sales line would have been 47 million more on the topline and about 20 million more net profit
3241812 this company is well positioned to take advantage of our significant asset base
3241813 we want to become the agricultural production powerhouse of australia
3241814 the cattle price is rising and there is what would appear to be very strong underlying demand for protein in the next six months onwards
3241815 its embryonic ideas that takes you out into other agribusiness
3241816 were good at feedlotting cattle the next extension of that is you say why beef cattle dairy cattle is obviously the next one
3241817 and when you talk about feedlotting animals of that quantity you need the crops to feed them so we can either grow the crops ourselves or rely on other farmers to do that for us
3241818 the thing australia has compared to say brazil or uzbekistan or any of those places is that we have a stable economy stable politics a currency thats tradable and a financial system that is one of the best in the world
3241819 its in process could be a while yet ill keep the market updated but i cant say too much about it
3241820 what were looking at doing is either forestry type carbon sinking which is one avenue
3241821 there is also reducing our own footprint thats methane gas reduction from cattle
3241822 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
3241823 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

3241828 i dont see any reason why bindra shouldnt make at least a couple of crores tens of millions of rupees now
3241829 he is young good looking and has a photogenic face all of these factors count for signing up decent contracts
3241830 we backed him at athens we have backed him now its a dream come true for him and us
3241831 i had expected endorsements to come his way after he won the world championship gold medal in 2006 in zagreb croatia but that didnt happen
3241832 shooting has never been on the national radar but this is a huge feat this is about an olympic medal
3241833 we are proud of his win and the fact that he is one of the six samsung olympic ratnas jewels we will try and leverage this association
3241834 bindras gold will create a movement of sorts in the country and change the mindset of people towards other sports something that was needed in a country which does have an appetite for sports other than cricket
3241835 it is for him to decide if he wants to get out and surge into the advertising game we have always believed in his potential and will continue to do so

3241837 china has been producing wine since at least the tang dynasty a d 618 a d 907 and possibly as early as the han dynasty 206 b c to a d 220 when the first vinifera grapes were known to have arrived there
3241838 recent years have seen the rise of a small number of boutique estates that aim to produce upscale wines with international appeal and that are using foreign consultants to help them achieve that goal
3241839 they have absolutely got the land and the climate to make great wine it is just a matter of training
3241840 you cant always get what you want you cant always get what you want you cant always get what you want but if you try sometimes you just might find you get what you need
3241841 obviously people feel the need to talk about their neighbour and their friends and their teachers professors students in a negative light while maintaining a pseudonym online and thats the forum to do it

3241843 the motive of this website is hate and its this very counter intuitive thing nobody really understands its raison detre
3241844 it is your responsibility to put your hand over your wallet

3241846 it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon him
3241847 the biggest problem confronting the world today is the illusion that our differences matter more than our common humanity

3241872 addressing the top officials from several ministries and organisations antony said aero india 2009 should be conducted in such a manner that it provides a benchmark for similar shows being organised in various parts of the world
3241873 similar interactions will also be encouraged between small and medium enterprises from home and abroad efforts are also being made to give exposure to students of technical and engineering colleges to encourage them to be part of the countrys aim of becoming a design hub in aerospace technologies in the foreseeable future
3241874 i will expect loyalty today and in the future in every situation but especially in situations as important as polands safety from every government worker
3241875 not everyone passes this test of loyalty as it appears
3241876 i got the impression that political interests were more important than the safety of the nation
3241877 during talks among donald tusk radoslaw sikorski and minister slawomir nowak there were opinions that a project is unacceptable if it could be seen in public opinion as the presidents success
3241878 this pattern of attack appears aimed not at restoring any status quo ante in south ossetia but rather at toppling the democratically elected government of georgia
3241879 that makes russias recent actions against the georgians all the more alarming
3241880 in the face of russian aggression the very existence of independent georgia and the survival of its democratically elected government are at stake
3241881 and look i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3241882 threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3241883 the tough and prestigious red flag exercise formally started aug 10 with a briefing and mission planning by the participating air forces
3241884 we have trained long and hard for this day it is time to showcase our professionalism
3241885 i have total faith and confidence in you the world is watching us so gentlemen lets show them what we are made up of
3241886 the iaf and other visiting air forces along with a large us air force element would be part of the friendly blue forces that would engage in combat with the aggressors the red forces
3241887 exercise red flag provides a realistic war situation in which the blue force pilots will have all possible odds thrown at them availability of a large air to air range with threat replication contributes to the tremendous training value of the exercise
3241888 the replication of the air war would see the iafs sukhoi 30 aircraft participating in suppression of enemy air defence sead in air to air and air to ground missions
3241889 the first point of the plan is a truce and ceasefire
3241890 i grade morales as not only a five star prospect but as an upper echelon one at that you dont need more than one hand to count the number of left handers at any level who can match morales on a pure stuff level and that really does count for something you say i have no reliable data points i argue that scouting reports are reliable data points and in my experience far more reliable for evaluating prospects than raw minor league statistics not that pure performance isnt important but its not as important to me as scouting reports
3241891 im that way because i choose to be because ive considered other sentiments and preferences and attitudes and made my selection the ones i chose fit my style and personality best
3241892 i work well with mechanical things but i have no talent for dealing with ideas
3241893 how did you acquire your particular identity c your sentiments andpreferences and attitudes
3241894 im an individual no one else influences me i do my own thing select the sentiments and preferences and attitudes that suit me
3241895 i keep hope because i dont want to believe the other side of it
3241896 in my mind im still keeping up because i dont want to lose that hope im hoping theres someone in the country who knows where he is
3241897 im just looking everywhere and pleading for someone to help my son and find him
3241898 not at all not at all i dont think about that part of the park i know the police officers are trying to do their best to try and wipe out all the doubt because it was pretty cold and i dont believe he would be going there
3241899 the place he tries to go to is the childrens corner in the park theres a swing and slide and he used to go there and hes very fascinated by all these things
3241900 were just hoping this feeling wont last forever were just waiting for our son to come back to us
3241901 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3241902 any of the campaigns that would have tried to push that would have been burned by it
3241903 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama

3241905 the good when it comes to tools maybin is home depot he has outstanding size and athleticism projecting to hit for average and power while also being a total burner he effortlessly covers ground in center field and his arm is outstanding hes shown a solid approach at the plate has great instincts on the base paths and backs up his natural ability with a strong work ethic
3241906 hes got a nice package of skills and ability to go along with that makeup hes 20 years old and having success in triple a but for as much talent as he has his family deserves all the credit for the quality person he is something like that cannot be quantified
3241907 bruce is loaded with both tools and skills hes a fantastic hitter who is seemingly incapable of light contact projecting as a 300 hitter who approaches 100 extra base hits annually he has average to slightly above speed and has proven to be surprisingly capable in center field while also showcasing a strong arm he supplements his natural abilities with strong makeup and an outstanding work ethic

3241954 we have invited these pastors to come here and conduct the prayer and you people should leave them alone
3241955 we implore the international community and those involved to take action against the crimes committed against ming zhang and his orphanage the eviction and closure of an orphanage on christmas day due to the religious persecution of its caretaker is behavior that can not be tolerated of any government or nation
3241956 i received in iraq accounts of a devastating wave of bombings beheadings kidnappings death threats vandalism and discrimination against christians in iraq who are persecuted by their own countrymen sunni shiite and kurdish extremists
3241957 now is the time for americas christian leaders to intensify efforts to protect christians in iraq and urge the u s government to help iraqis practice their faith freely and openly
3241958 were urging all people to join the effort to save iraqi christians
3241959 we are saddened to acknowledge that the violence in orissa which left at least four killed and 730 houses and 95 churches burnt will go into the history books as an unprecedented attack on christians in india
3241960 the tragedy is deepened by the fact that the violence was avoidable if the authorities had enforced the rule of law
3241961 many of them had a yellow ribbon on their heads and vermilion http en wikipedia org wiki vermilion on their foreheads
3241962 in all the villages we have visited people testify that the attacks destruction and looting was done in the presence of the police
3241963 conspiracy to hide the bodies of christians killed by vhp cadre to destroy evidence
3241964 many are missing both adults and children in every village
3241965 on that day dec 24 an old hindu person had died naturally to desecrate the place of worship of christians the vhp cadre brought the body and cremated it right in front of the pulpit of a church that was celebrating christmas eve the ashes of the body remain there until today jan 5 we have a photograph
3241966 later all of them were told to eat raw rice mixed with goat blood to become hindus
3241967 unless someone steps in i foresee a bleak future for pakistan with the taliban running the show behind the scenes perhaps christianity being banned as it is now in afghanistan next door
3241968 it would give people time to grieve and settle down emotionally
3241969 it is not but they feel it is in order to buy time
3241970 fresh memories of bhuttos death would have put them in their proper place losing the election
3241971 most assuredly musharraf is the one and only person who could benefit from this horrific murder
3241972 if mrs bhuttos husband and son are able to do half of what she would have done then they will do all should work out just fine if musharraf is able to stifle them as well then only god knows the horrors pakistan will be forced to face with musharraf in charge
3241973 yes because the people need to grieve and her husband and son need time to show they are a worthy replacement
3241974 with delaying the elections musharraf can further himself from the murder of mrs
3241975 my initial reaction was if pakistan doesnt fall apart maybe this will keep them from being railroaded by the west
3241976 had she not died there could be at best a detente between her and the other political figures sharif and musharraf
3241977 pakistan is now heading for greater disintegration or greater regional autonomy depending on ones point of view
3241978 where there is trouble there are hurting hearts and there can be open doors for the gospel we dont know what god will do with this but we can pray
3241979 delay in the election is a good idea at this point to hold an election would mean to just go through the administrative motions there must be too many people who are hurt or who have only revenge on their minds they need time to slow down quiet down and regain some wee bit of hope in the democratic process if an election is to be worth anything i dont know whether they can do that and there may be further shoes to drop
3241980 the harm of postponing the elections consists of two parts
3241981 i think on balance holding the elections would be more harmful upheaval in the short term would likely be worse and then nothing scorches the ground quite like a failed election a failed election is what you have when large elements of the electorate boycott the vote and others are effectively disenfranchised because their candidates are dead banned or totally absent only cynicism flourishes in that kind of soil and pakistan might not be ready for a serious election for several years
3241982 i was saddened when i initially heard the news and from what i have heard from ms bhutto since my sadness has deepened
3241983 i see the country plunging into further turmoil while pakistans nuclear weapons are apparently safe at this time the possibility exists for elements within the military and government to conspire with the radical islamists
3241984 yes because if the elections were held as planned it would be an excuse for more violence
3241985 i was dismayed bhutto was sort of a heroine of mine not necessarily because of her political views but because as a women she overcame tremendous religious as well as political opposition to lead
3241986 in reality no one her enemies have made a martyr out of her of all people muslim extremists should know that martyrs are powerful motivators her nation has lost a leader a great loss for any nation
3241987 i was first informed of mrs bhuttos death in person by presidential candidate mike huckabee at a rally in orlando florida my reaction was the same as his dismay and expressing heartfelt condolences and sympathy
3241988 radical jihadists have benefited most by her death due to the destabilizing influence on the country hopefully pakistan will continue to head toward a more democratic government after this tragedy delaying the elections for one month is not good but probably necessary it would have been good to hold the elections as originally planned if that had been possible possible harm could be propaganda for the jihadists and further riots
3241989 benazir bhutto is a great heroine of history she could always have opted for the life of the spoiled little rich girl once she finished her studies in europe and america but she went back to pakistan after her education and tried twice to clean up her country regretfully she had a husband who could not be trusted and twice he created situations which both embarrassed ms bhutto and caused her government to crumble
3241990 pakistans dictator cut a deal even took off his uniform at the direction of washington when he suspended parliament a few months back and we have poured money into his regime while ostensibly developing a new ally when bhutto became an obvious threat to his regime and as her popularity grew before the upcoming elections he simply had her eliminated and now has appeared before the international media and claimed
3241991 the terrorists and possibly the present government including the military
3241992 i am concerned that the country will move away from democracy and freedom of religion especially for christians it may have been a good move by the government but not a good move for the people
3241993 i think it would have removed some of the suspicion that the government was involved in the assassination the killing of bhutto appears to be too convenient for the government postponement could turn into martial law as it did years ago in the philippines it is my hope that bhuttos party will have the opportunity to regroup and find a leader i think the strongest leader and perhaps the best hope of democracy and freedom for christians in the country has been snuffed out
3241994 also i could not believe my ears when i heard an interview of musharraf on tv he said the assassination of bhutto was her completely her fault because she stood up on the car how callous
3241995 the terrorist will benefit most the present government secondly the muslim militants
3241996 return to a military dictatorship operated by increasingly oppressive islam
3241997 had the elections been held as scheduled that might have given musharraf some credibility but the back side of that elections would have been reactive and the opposing side could not have had preparations or participations hence sheer chaos
3241998 i knew it was going to happen when she first set foot back in pakistan i was not the least bit surprised
3241999 the same as it has been before ms bhuttos the assassination
3242000 her killing stunned me personally she was such a bright light of hope on so many levels especially to women and persecuted minorities like the christians of pakistan
3242001 i could hardly think of anything else for the rest of that day i saw similar reactions from many around me even those who had never lived in south asia and hardly knew anything about that part of the world
3242002 her murder was a wake up call for those of us who had grown used to daily reports of suicide bombings and attacks in pakistan and throughout the muslim world it has helped to focus peoples attention on the destructive impact of islamic jihad not just on christians but on other muslims and so many innocent bystanders and of course incidents like this help the whole world to understand the culture of violence that dominates not only pakistan but the neighboring states the jihadist culture dominates not only pakistan but north india and afghanistan as well
3242003 as christians i dont see think we should see this murder so much in political or military terms but as a prod to prayer probably it wont matter much on the ground unless we use it as a focus for more prayer we have to reach out to pakistanis we meet every day in love and to muslims everywhere expressing our sympathy to them and pray for the muslim world
3242004 i was very sad when benazir bhutto was murdered because she was christian minoritys only hope to rid pakistan of blasphemy law
3242005 i believe that the benefit of her murder is split between the government and the taleban in a bid to hang onto power the military didnt protect ms bhutto well enough that bought them time to stay in power while shifting the blame to terrorists
3242006 it can only get worse in pakistan unless the governments of the country and america team up to stomp out the taleban
3242007 it would be a bad move if the election was delayed longer than the february 8th date already set the taliban know this and im sure will cause as much trouble as they can
3242008 im looking forward to getting back in the ring its been a long time and i feel like ive been training for ages for absolutely nothing this new opportunity will be something to channel all my efforts into
3242009 ive also been told that one or two wins and i could be in the mix for the area 11st belt
3242010 thats definitely something for me to aim for certainly in the next 12 months or so
3242011 id had a long spell of inactivity due to some faults on their side and some problems of my own
3242012 i have never been back and i dont know anything about that side of my life
3242013 i was your classic school wimp i had a bad time i suffered from bullying for being small and from being one of only three black kids in the school was three all together out of 1500 children another girl and another boy the boy was a big jamaican lad a real hard kid my dad wasnt working at that point so i would go to school looking a scruff cheap clothes cheap trainers i got into boxing because i wanted to be able look after myself
3242014 my first boxing memory and the reason i got absolutely hooked on it is sugar ray leonard
3242015 years later during the contender series i ended meeting sugar ray leonard i got my photo in lobby with him and then a wicked one over at ringside it was a really big thing for me he was the reason i got into boxing when we spoke he was pretty chuffed that he was my first boxing memory and got me hooked especially with me now being a promoter trainer and manager
3242016 my mum wouldnt let me box she was dead against it it wasnt until i was 15 and the first benn eubank fight and after that i just thought im doing it that was on the saturday and it was the monday that i went
3242017 i was good in the gym but as soon as it came to a fight and the gloves and head guard were on id want to chicken out the amount of times i said i wasnt going to box but went through with it i lost my first eight i remember praying let me win tonight please let this be the one you would have to go to school and tell people it were horrible
3242018 i beat number six in britain mark hearns and then we had a rematch and i beat him again and after that brendan ingle said right were going to turn pro so i did
3242019 when i turned pro again id look great in the gym a classic gym fighter
3242020 i boxed jason booth i boxed hussein hussein who fought for the wbc world title i boxed jose lopez bueno in spain knocked him down twice and lost a close decision he won a world title two fights after that i did ok but just not what i could have achieved with the confidence i have now
3242021 without boxing i wouldnt even be able to speak to you like this never mind being on television or radio
3242022 i started off as a car salesman i enjoyed it but its the sort of job i would have always been stuck with that or retail i enjoy what im doing and i have a nice life im happy and its all down to boxing
3242023 brendan had a second gym up on the manor a notorious area of sheffield and i used to run that for him so i started training kids from an early age alongside my own career i have been training kids a long time now i think it was august 96 when it started so i have trained kids for about 12 years when i left brendan as a fighter i got my own gym set up and just carried on training the kids really
3242024 then you have people like ryan rhodes who i am really close to family wise from his parents to his little girl who plays with my little girl
3242025 but when ryan stopped gary woolcombe out of all the years i have been in boxing that stands above everything as my proudest moment it was such an achievement because of what he has come from i was dead proud of him we have come through the hard way away from the limelight
3242026 when we were in the ring having photos and that my mind just switched to kell brook because his british title was coming up in a couple of weeks at same venue
3242027 when kell then went on and won the title it was brilliant
3242028 they are my two massive achievements but hopefully there is more to come
3242029 sometimes a kid might get beat and it doesnt mean he is not as good as an undefeated kid on a big promotion its just that they havent been looked after with the same backing thats why i got the managers and promoters licence
3242030 training is hard work physically in the gym in the gym i have mark willie who helps me on the conditioning side plus one or two others when coming up to fights but day in day out its just me in the gym
3242031 managing is hard work stress wise because you have to manage these fellas careers right you have to find the right path for them be it a journeyman or a prospect
3242032 but promoting is by far the most stressful because you could lose your money which as an independent would mean coming out of your personal bank account
3242033 on some of my shows there might be eight fights and i might have six on that ill be working the corners for
3242034 people are spending their money we have this credit crunch going on and things are getting tighter and tighter for people so if people are spending their money to come to one of my shows then i hope they leave thinking they enjoyed it id hate to think of someone forking out the money when they are already struggling for bills and then the show being a pile of shit
3242035 i have been friends with adam and david for quite a while since before daves first fight i have always liked they way they do things their own way and to keep succeeding
3242036 wed meet up whenever they were in sheffield and go to nandos or whatever
3242037 adam and david are very clever people forget about the boxing david haye is a very clever man on this business side and so is adam booth
3242038 i was blown away by their plans they were so exciting and fresh and they wanted me to be involved at every level
3242039 the concept we are doing is absolutely fantastic the fighters that we have got are over the moon with what we are doing its for fighters who want to see how good they are hayemaker promotions will be right at the top in couple of years time we dont expect it to happen over night but its caused waves already and has people talking about it
3242040 michael maguire and george groves are two stand out amateurs that we have got everyone in london knows about george groves the kid can punch and has a crowd pleasing style michael maguire is really talented and we expect big things from him
3242041 then there are the kids with a bit more experience josh wale who is unbeaten in seven at super bantamweight
3242042 then we have martin lindsay hes a really good kid very clever he came out to cyprus with us and we have hopes for him
3242043 curtis woodhouse is an exciting kid packed up football to go into boxing and nobody took him seriously
3242044 and then we have our senior members like ryan rhodes
3242045 forgetting the fact that hes my boss laughing what he has achieved in 21 fights and they way he has done it i think he is the most exciting fighter that we have got in the uk
3242046 whether you like him or not hes exciting and has people talking about him he has the confidence to speak out loud and it might come across as brash but its just his confidence underneath that hes just a normal kid one of the lads
3242047 we had eleven boxers out there in cyprus and david was just one of the lads nothing prima donna about him at all its just when it comes to business hes confident
3242048 i never switch my phone off except when im in the cinema which is only every couple of weeks my time to relax is when im playing with my little girl like today we are chilling out and ill take her shopping later im never fully switched off though im always thinking about shows coming up or what we need to do to what fighter before i became a dad id be out all the time i dont drink but id just be out all the time
3242049 im a big manchester united fan and not a glory boy i remember days of arthur albiston kevin moran and all them guys i remember it from ron atkinsons days i follow sheffield united and sheffield wednesday because they are local but united especially as we have had a good link up with them because of curtis woodhouse
3242050 i have really enjoyed my time in boxing and have learnt a lot off a lot of people
3242051 im not one of these kids who thinks he knows it all and has done it all himself i havent i have learnt a lot and i have had a lot of good friends in boxing it was well worth persevering when i was losing my first eight fights as an amateur i dont think anyone would have blamed me for jacking it in out of embarrassment

3242053 phishing pharming virus attacks and hacking of systems belonging to companies is no longer done for fun or curiosity but is now big business as there is money to made from such invasions
3242054 at the same time the public and companies both often lose large sums of money as a result of fraud committed by people who are difficult to trace
3242055 it is possible to create the hardware as there are already some levels of protection provided by existing hardware components
3242056 we now need to make sure that they can offer protection for all types of invasions

3242060 for sure it is a she she was sitting right there where you are
3242061 boy he i mean she found the right spot to rest then
3242062 yeah she could have fallen down there i think shes in great pain and has broken something because she didnt even try to fly away when i came and she is probably hungry too might have been trapped here for several days
3242063 when the project was conceptualized it was conceptualized with a subsidy
3242064 you cant do any of this stuff without a subsidy none of it makes sense
3242065 there was a commitment when steve leeper was the sports amp exhibition authority director that there would be no additional taxpayer money used in the development between the stadiums somebody has decided to change that rule thats not surprising given everything thats happened in the past year on this land
3242066 given that they were able to purchase the land at one fifteenth of its value at some point we have to question why all the benefits are being given to one developer for one piece of land
3242067 right now the land is sitting there it is generating zero revenue except parking revenue for the sports amp exhibition authority the steelers will buy the land at a value determined six years ago they will put up an entertainment facility that will pay sales tax back to the state liquor taxes back to the state real estate taxes back to the city county and school district and income taxes back to the city and the state
3242068 the sum total of that will be an excellent return back to the state

3242074 its been a real help because it means building contractors are far more clued up that they used to be
3242075 we opened the sale office our fourth earlier this summer hopefully well get our name around and developers and construction companies will start to come to us to do the archaeological checks the planning system requires

3242078 i want to know why lend lease have let down stockport after years of negotiation and investment this is a prestige site which offers major opportunities to the right developer
3242079 stockport is an active ambitious borough moving forward on a range of investments
3242080 lend lease has invested millions of pounds in consulting and preparing plans we all understand the credit crunch is having an effect but their action is bitterly disappointing
3242081 this is an exceptional project for us which will take about two years to complete

3242083 the system has been chosen in a red and grey colour scheme for its aesthetic qualities and its ability to avoid cracking which can be caused by high traffic density
3242084 deckshields anti slip surface also ensures safety underfoot and reduces tyre squeal and it is chemical resistant so able to deal with petrol diesel or brake fluid spillages
3242085 the conference and event market is continually evolving and we are proud to be leading the way in terms of the technological ability we provide to our clients
3242086 as a result we are winning business from around the globe all of which is managed from bollington
3242087 this new investment is designed to strengthen our position further placing us at the forefront of the event industry
3242088 we are targeting the utility sector which has to meet strict environmental criteria foam concrete effectively allows existing concrete to be recycled when companies are digging up the roads the rubble is usually sent to landfill sites
3242089 however the rubble can be put into our mixers and combined with specialist cement to create the foam concrete and then refill the holes which is more environmentally friendly
3242090 the fire was a massive blow to the company and there were times when we felt like giving up
3242091 we lost a lot of business and it took longer than expected to get the trucks back on the road
3242092 we have found the support received from ukti invaluable and it has helped us grow our business in several new markets
3242093 we are still quite a small family firm and it was very helpful to have our international trade adviser carol
3242094 she has been a great support and is always on hand to offer us advice and we have found that working with a respected international trade organisation such as ukti has helped us to meet prestigious buyers and distributors worldwide
3242095 catering at the queens birthday party was a wonderful occasion and the food certainly went down well we received a lot of compliments
3242096 we didnt go out to lisbon with the intention of looking for new business but we have received contracts and met a new distributor as a result of our cooking that day
3242097 and now we are planning more development overseas and hope to increase our production capacity in order to expand further
3242098 pasco spices was the first company to come out and prepare their own food and their dishes went down extremely well
3242099 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on
3242100 its only been a week since we released the hot naga pickle and its been selling pretty well
3242101 this is a huge amount of council tax payers money mostly spent on short journeys mostly on non urgent matters
3242102 the people i represent will wonder why they have to pay to cross the m60 in rush hour to subsidise council staff who wont have to
3242103 but because ive been so busy dave has been organising everything hes been brilliant hes sent out all the invites hes handwritten every single one so i just hope hes got everybodys name right well find out on the day if none of my friends and family are there
3242104 weve both been married before so were not going over the top we are still having a big day but we want it to be more of a big party for all of our friends weve said to our friends dont buy us any presents just have a really good time its very much more laid back
3242105 we met after chris had been filming the celebrity version of family fortunes and decided to arrange a night out for all of us but secretly we both wanted to just meet up with each other and pretty much since then weve never left each others side
3242106 dave is just adorable hes the nicest man in the world
3242107 we are domestic cleaners that take on one off cleaning jobs right through to weekly contracts
3242108 after serving in the forces i was looking for something completely different you cant get more different than swapping jet fighters for vacuum cleaners
3242109 i chose the kingfisher centre after looking around at other sites this was ideal in terms of size rental costs and location
3242110 georgian armed forces received an order to leave gori and to fortify positions near mtskheta to defend the capital
3242111 the evacuation began suddenly when word came that the russians were 5km to 10km from the citys limits
3242112 i have seen civilians and the army fleeing georgian troops clinging to the back of quad bikes i have seen tanks leaving in no particular formation
3242113 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the president said
3242114 its actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3242115 the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims
3242116 tbilisi was bombed bombs hit the village of kojori and makhata mountain
3242117 the world has a moral duty to stop the madness
3242118 it is obvious the russian invasion had been planned for months and months and months the timing of this intervention has been chosen deliberately with regards to the olympics
3242119 quality needs to be put into magazines today otherwise there will be no reason for magazines to exist
3242120 its the thinking also though to say that that fashion means terrorism thats a dangerous type of thinking it really is
3242121 before you even make some crazy statement like that you should try to understand where the pattern came from and what that means
3242122 i am king is a statement about all men we are all descendents of royalty and if we carry ourselves and respect ourselves in that manner and believe in ourselves then we are all kings
3242123 i am king is a statement about all men we are all descendents of royalty and if we carry ourselves and respect ourselves in that manner and believe in ourselves then we are all kings
3242124 i am king is a statement about all men we are all descendents of royalty and if we carry ourselves and respect ourselves in that manner and believe in ourselves then we are all kings
3242125 literally the day after we sell enough units we can start construction
3242126 if theres not a recession in the rest of the country there is definitely a recession here
3242127 take away our beaches take away the ringling museum and take away spring training why the hell would anyone come here
3242128 the red sox nation has thousands of fans who go all over the world
3242129 as soon as the red sox come here i can assure you that a huge number of these execs will come here
3242130 as silly as that sounds to those who arent familiar with the red sox phenomenon in the northeast its true
3242131 this thing was submitted to the voters now its twice as big
3242132 hey the economys taking a nosedive and were going to give 40 million to millionaire ballplayers
3242133 i think there was a lost opportunity and there were some regrets after that happened with the loss of the reds
3242134 i think theres a belief among both commissions that you dont get a lot of second chances
3242135 the public wants zero risk when they transfuse and were very close to that thats why we do some tests multiple ways
3242136 as far as the fda is concerned were no different from merck or pfizer
3242137 it could go back out to sea or keep going into florida at that point we dont know
3242138 then we might put duffy in front of an indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull ultimately we want to take a variety of content and sprinkle it across the right screens
3242139 this is the first step in the development of an electric field refrigeration unit
3242140 for the future we can envision a flat panel refrigerator no more coils no more compressors just solid polymer with appropriate heat exchangers
3242141 i remember one case a sex case involving a child
3242142 the police detective really hadnt done anything on it so i gave it to dave
3242143 the next thing i know he walks in my door and hes got a confession i think he has great people skills and would make a great sheriff
3242144 he knows the department the people who work there there is a great deal of stability having larry take over
3242145 i know him as a really intelligent guy someone who really just is dedicated keeps to himself and goes about his business
3242146 there is no fire separation between the units there are no fire sprinklers no alarms its quite a safety hazard
3242147 i want everything to be legal i just think its politics and people who dont have a heart for the homeless
3242148 they are in a building that doesnt have a certificate of occupancy for someone to live there
3242149 there is no fire separation between the units there are no fire sprinklers no alarms
3242150 i just think its politics and people who dont have a heart for the homeless
3242151 at that point they would have a chance to try to file an appeal but in the meantime given the really drastic building code violations we would have to try to pursue other measures to get the people out of there
3242152 if a teacher is abusing kids or is even suspected of abusing kids youd think they would report it
3242153 maybe it would never have got to where it got with our kids
3242154 i dont know that anyone would have seen the previous reports as indicative of a pattern
3242155 there were numerous interviews with school employees and nurses who were in the classroom and never saw anything
3242156 they were probably a little afraid of diana afraid of losing their jobs
3242157 in my mind if she was rough it wasnt intentional
3242158 because it didnt continue i didnt think anything more of it
3242159 the other thing they told me as an example on december 3 she smacked a kid in the head well that may take three seconds out of a day that is 405 minutes long the rest of the day may have been great and then you may have two or three days when nothing happens at all
3242160 we think its a zero sum cost to the city but that has to be thought through and agreed to by the city
3242161 all were doing is redistributing that traffic locally were not adding traffic
3242162 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3242163 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3242164 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3242165 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3242166 it would be handy to have a little cheat sheet that clearly stated refer these cases with this info
3242167 several commissioners said they want additional information before they are ready to commit to the major purchases
3242168 city commissioner rob chestnut said he wanted to see more hard data quantifying the condition of the citys fire trucks before accepting the opinion that the vehicles are in immediate need of replacement
3242169 we have a speculative bubble in prices thats giving way to what now i think are more moderate levels
3242170 i think we can look forward to a resumption of an improvement in equity prices based on still good earnings coming out of many companies
3242171 as long as applications were made and approved in advance
3242172 we chinese people love the olympics and support the olympics and thats why there are no protesters
3242173 we have been taught that even if we screw up in life to hide it
3242174 i think fairies has the potential to be as big as princesses
3242175 we were fundamentally missing an opportunity in terms of getting tinker bell out there as a character
3242176 the big challenge disney has is to change it on one hand so it becomes more modern and appealing for the next generation but on the other hand theyre almost changing a religion they can very easily trip and fall down
3242177 i love russians im one fourth russian but i cannot agree with what the russian government is doing
3242178 hes supposed to leave but im not letting him leave
3242179 my sister is a pretty calm person they were woken up with noises of explosions its unpredictable what the russians will do
3242180 the russians did not want to let go of georgia
3242181 being part of the soviet union they dealt with us however they wanted when we became independent they became very unhappy about it
3242182 tbilisi is like a small paris a tourist destination and people were really moving into the future this warfare is devastating this will set them back years and years
3242183 many have fled with literally the clothes on their back
3242184 until theres a meaningful cease fire aid workers cant get into conflict zones to assess how bad the situation is and to help those people get out secondly we know some people are not able to flee in either direction north or south
3242185 civilians are the innocent victims caught in the middle of this conflict
3242186 thats what im worried about with this new development that their vision doesnt include a rubato records that it doesnt include me
3242187 it probably would include a red robin or a gap or an ipod store
3242188 i dont know anyone whos excited to live above a desert sun
3242189 what i dont think some developers understand is theyre depressing rather than enhancing the value of the property but a lot dont care because theyre going to flip out of it
3242190 theres obviously a desire in this community to see the independent spirit remain
3242191 but some of these big gaps that are missing could be filled by a recognizable name
3242192 i cant compete with starbucks i cant compete with jamba juice
3242193 redeveloped spaces lease for two or three times what the original people paid
3242194 thats a huge bummer so what we end up with are fairly expensive restaurants and regional or national retailers
3242195 its got to work economically or everybodys going to suffer nobody wants to see a failing business
3242196 that street presence is a vital ingredient of what we do
3242197 there arent that many good tools to benefit for profit businesses but we recognize its an important part of retaining character in a neighborhood so were still scratching our heads about employing the best approaches
3242198 qu significa ll m lo busqu pero no lo pude encontrar en ning n lado
3242199 los estudiantes que est n cursando una maestr a en leyes o ll m deben saber que los or genes de este diploma yacen en el estudio del derecho civil n entendido como derecho contiental y el derecho can nico los que eran ense ados en universidades inglesas mucho antes de que el common law se estudiase all las letras dobles es un m todo del lat n para connotar un plural por lo que las ll designan estas dos antiguas formas de derecho aunque hoy en d a raramente un ll m se enfoca en el derecho civil o derecho can nico las universidades han adoptado esta antigua denominaci n en respeto de esa tradici n
3242200 i love the art of hip hop i dont always love the message of hip hop
3242201 there are times where even with the artists i love you know theres a message that is not only sometimes degrading to women not only uses the n word a little too frequently but also something im really concerned about its always talking about material things
3242202 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
3242203 what happened at that school constitutes race discrimination under federal anti discrimination laws that is why it is important that needs to be stopped
3242204 the problem public schools have is that it is a first amendment issue so public schools havent been very successful
3242205 youll want to know about lawrence of course everybody does if they dont ask outright they will make some oblique reference in hopes of sparking a conversation or perhaps an argument
3242206 the challenge was how do you tell the story of this monster and make him sympathetic
3242207 sometimes i run into that when i do book signings
3242208 the civil war has never really died in this area you see that every time there are kansas and missouri sports with that rivalry people have long memories
3242209 history is told by the winners but im not trying to justify what he did im just making him human
3242210 the lawrence raid certainly eclipsed anything else that he did and it is the event that made him a household name
3242211 i think the attention is certainly justified i dont think it was the kind of notoriety that he would have sought
3242212 its a great topic for this type of a psychological novel
3242213 not only was he on the wrong side the side that wanted to preserve slavery he turned up the violence a notch but im sure its a complicated story he thought he was doing the right thing as most people do
3242214 were cheering for both countries because china welcomes the u s
3242215 i dont know the rules of archery very clearly actually i dont even know how many members are on a team
3242216 so i will open my eyes wide i cant afford to miss a single detail
3242217 its not easy to buy tickets but fortunately my friend gave me some
3242218 reverse mortgages may benefit some senior investors by unlocking their home equity but they should only be entered into carefully and with a complete understanding of the consequences
3242219 to pass a strong resolution getting the russians to show some restraint
3242220 is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint
3242221 to immediately and unconditionally withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3242222 persoonlijke gaaf initiatief inderdaad volg het al enige tijd en vind het concept ik zou het aantal trends tot de top 5 beperken deze zijn
3242223 ive always felt like we have the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett or management or whatever
3242224 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3242225 i understand the attention around him his performance tonight and him playing tonight
3242226 but i saw aaron just like he is every day i thought he went out there he played with excellent energy which i always recall him playing with i think hes done a really good job being consistent and understanding that the microphone is on him with all the attention but those are really outside external forces that we cant really pay attention to
3242227 offensively we got off to a slow start but we picked up the pace as the half went on
3242228 the problem is that local communities have a genuine stake in land which is unrecognised in law giving away land without consulting these communities will lead to gross disparities
3242229 more efficiently and avoid misusing it to regulate global climate change
3242230 it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impact affecting species
3242231 these changes take unbiased professional wildlife biologists out of the equation and put decisions in the hands of political appointees
3242232 its a very clear message to the insurgents that there will be no other chance
3242233 i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was reduced to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire
3242234 the town and many nearby villages are too dangerous there are many wounded no one knows how many are dead
3242235 harry potter and pinocchio are apparently not welcome in israel at least in their arabic translations imported from syria and lebanon
3242236 the trade and industry ministry and treasury warned me that importing those books is illegal
3242237 i will support the candidacy of shaul mofaz because he is the best candidate to lead the party and the state
3242238 they even killed female goats because their private parts were not covered and their tails were pointed upward which they said was haram
3242239 they regarded the cucumber as male and tomato as female women were not allowed to buy cucumbers only men
3242240 destroying the hamas regime down to the last office and the last activist you control another people against their will
3242241 the problem is that local communities have a genuine stake in land which is unrecognised in law giving away land without consulting these communities will lead to gross disparities
3242242 more efficiently and avoid misusing it to regulate global climate change
3242243 it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impact affecting species
3242244 these changes take unbiased professional wildlife biologists out of the equation and put decisions in the hands of political appointees
3242245 its a very clear message to the insurgents that there will be no other chance
3242246 saya kira semuanya kita kembalikan bahwa apa yang terjadi di lapangan dalam konteks hal hal yang perlu kita lakukan untuk penegakan keamanan kita letakkan pada proses hukum
3242247 if we start moving right now i can still get 6 hours of sleep maybe
3242248 a lot of times when you get to an event like this an olympic games youre going to put way too much pressure on yourself i kind of got an out with cancer
3242249 it just takes the pressure off swimming if you ask any swimmer when the pressures off you swim faster
3242250 when you basically have the best doctor in the world telling you youre going to be ok you have confidence
3242251 but this isnt the flu its cancer when i have downtime days when theres not much going on its on my mind constantly i cant help that
3242252 if we bring the engines to one hundred and fifteen percent theyll overheat before we get there

3242272 hey there flopping head mastermind thank you for raising cane aboot nothing
3242273 las iglesias suelen utilizar muy mal los argumentos cient ficos
3242274 hay que intentar hacer razonar a la gente la gente cuando se vuelve razonable se vuelve muy tolerante
3242275 todo se or que no acepta que desde el primer momento el embri n es persona o un ser humano o es tonto o es un malvado
3242276 solo dios da la vida y nadie m s puede quitar

3242279 he has been forced to withdraw its a military blunder it caused an international incident
3242280 we are receiving only moral and humanitarian help from the international community but we need more than that
3242281 an attempt of repeated occupation and enslavement of georgia depriving our country of its independence is underway
3242282 russias goal is to put an end to the existence of the georgian state
3242283 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on
3242284 buffalo bills house is dilapidated but the newer lodge on the property was meant to be a monastery
3242285 we are sleeping in all kinds of places all over the property one is sleeping in the library one in the office we are going to have to be moving no matter what
3242286 young men simply could not adjust to a solitary life they needed a community thats why i asked for permission from the prior to start a monastic community
3242287 i think we are the only community of carmelite monks in the world that live a cloistered life
3242288 roasted solely by real monks who are passionate about coffee
3242289 it is a longstanding tradition that carmelites drink coffee using both hands in thanksgiving for the fruits of the harvest
3242290 out here in wyoming theres not much you can do i have a brother michael mary who worked in coffee shops all his life and really has a lot of knowledge about coffee so we just went for the gusto and tried it
3242291 grandma youve worked your fingers to the bone you deserve this

3242297 i go down to philip pullmans house and go through his trash
3242298 why harry potter became a phenomenon while artemis fowl only remains a huge sensation is a conundrum for future ages to ponder

3242300 people asked why arent we doing all three were giving them the same attention
3242301 mengapa tuhan memberikan talenta begitu hebatnya kepada dia sedangkan kepada saya tidak jika saya diberkahi kemampuan yang seperti itu pasti saya akan berprestasi seperti orang itu

3242360 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3242361 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3242362 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3242363 espero que el meu or obri la porta a molts m s per a lesport espanyol
3242364 un combat s una lluita guanyes o perds res m s
3242365 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3242366 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3242367 we have officially handed over our code to the microsoft office team for the integration of the translation tool directly in the research task pane
3242368 listen and understand what goes into a mans mouth does not make him unclean but what comes out of the mouth that is what makes him unclean
3242369 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3242370 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3242371 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3242372 luckily the sharp eyed people at the airport spotted it and saved us a long long search
3242373 it had been stationary for quite a while and was in a bad condition absolutely filthy
3242374 fortunately the car park boss who should be made an honorary member of the club after this waived every single penny and let us take the car for free
3242375 when the police request access to a vehicle parked in one of our car parks we always co operate as was the case in this very unusual situation
3242376 we are pleased to hear that everything was resolved positively for the club and wish them every success for the new season
3242377 opponents would have you believe that greater manchester does not have a congestion problem and that somehow we will magically avoid having to deal with what is a growing issue for every city region in the world
3242378 this latest research shows greater manchester has the slowest rush hour roads in the country and this will only get worse further damaging our economy and quality of life
3242379 we are bottom of the pile when it comes to road congestion and we must act quickly and decisively to give our city region a chance to remain economically competitive
3242380 the tif bid remains the only way greater manchester can access the huge financial investment required to bring our transport network up to the standard we urgently require
3242381 i am concerned the disproportionately large salary may attract someone not committed to staying at trafford long term and seeing the trust through difficult times

3242385 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3242386 the extent of the impact fuel prices are having on our business was underlined when we announced a loss of 663 million hong kong dollars 84 89 million us dollars in our interim results last week
3242387 while we are reducing services on some routes we will continue to maintain the integrity of our network reshaping it where necessary to ensure we fly aircraft to where we can cover our costs and also make some money

3242397 the history of the social security debate has taught that too many specifics especially during a presidential campaign has polarized the debate
3242398 as expected the markets bounced back on the back of positive global cues with rate sensitive sectors like realty construction and banking along with infrastructure and oil stocks leading the rally which took the market above the 4 600 levels stocks like reliance industries sbi ongc maruti bhel l amp t icici bank and reliance infra were the front runners these stocks were moving up on value buying and technical buying support
3242399 if nifty closes one more day beyond this level then we will see an uptrend towards 5 100 sustained sell off in commodity market will help the equities market across the globe except china where inflation recorded at a multi year high most of the institutional investors and retailers were busy with olympics the buying interest will resume in china may be after few weeks later

3242420 as robots enter our everyday life they need to have sensors everywhere on their bodies like humans
3242421 imagine they bump into babies robots need to feel temperatures heat and pressure like we do to co exist otherwise it would be dangerous
3242422 it could be completely integrated into the normal driving system making users unaware of using it
3242423 objects that come into contact with humans are often not square or flat we believe interfaces between humans and electronics should be soft
3242424 ive never seen anything like this in my career for software
3242425 phone differentiation used to be about radios and antennas and things like that
3242426 we think going forward the phone of the future will be differentiated by software
3242427 it gives iphone a justifiable claim to being a viable gaming platform
3242428 imagine you are scanning the papers looking to buy a property and next to each advertisement there is a number you can sms to pull extra information about that house
3242429 by simply smsing a word such as house to a number you could get sent a link that would enable you to download a video tour of the property that could be viewed directly off your cellphone
3242430 this would save people a lot of time as they could eliminate several options without having physically to view each house
3242431 the same principle applies in other contexts for example when trying to decide what film to watch you could request extra information or download a movie trailer directly onto your phone
3242432 help me sister permit me not to be separated from our lord jesus christ and your loving company

3242456 how the welfare state robs americans of money and spirit
3242457 what sort of information do they ask for in the requisition forms these days
3242458 you know how i would reorganize your department if i were you
3242459 why do we cross our fingers during turbulence even the most atheistic among us
3242460 religious behavior may be a misfiring an unfortunate byproduct of an underlying psychological propensity which in other circumstances is or once was useful
3242461 all of our raptures and our drynesses our longings and pantings our questions and beliefs are equally organically founded
3242462 imagine another animal that took injury for health or big for small or fast for slow or dead for alive its unlikely that such a species could survive
3242463 i started looking at history and i wondered why no society ever survived more than three generations without a religious foundation as its raison d tre
3242464 a family of cognitive phenomena that involves the extraordinary use of everyday cognitive processes
3242465 religions do not exist apart from the individual minds that constitute them and the environments that constrain them any more than biological species and varieties exist independently of the individual organisms that compose them and the environments that conform them
3242466 but most of our mental properties and potentials may be spandrels that is nonadaptive side consequences of building a device with such structural complexity
3242467 the most central concepts in religions are related to agents
3242468 people with superpowers statues that can answer requests or disembodied minds that can act on us and the world
3242469 we automatically and often unconsciously look for an explanation of why things happen to us
3242470 and stuff just happens is no explanation gods by virtue of their strange physical properties and their mysterious superpowers make fine candidates for causes of many of these unusual events
3242471 evolution always produces something that works for what it works for and then theres no control for however else its used
3242472 a martian anthropologist might look at this and say oh yes so these breasts must have somehow evolved to sell hygienic stuff or food to human beings
3242473 if your emotions are involved then thats the time when youre most likely to believe whatever the religion tells you to believe
3242474 if when we die theres nothing all your sun and fields and what not are all ah horror its just an ocean of horror
3242475 slipping sensation along his nerves that seemed to give the air hands he was robed in this certainty that the god who had lavished such craft upon these worthless birds would not destroy his whole creation by refusing to let david live forever
3242476 the human mind does not produce adequate comforting delusions against all situations of stress or fear
3242477 indeed any organism that was prone to such delusions would not survive long
3242478 try to fill your consciousness with the representation of no consciousness and you will see the impossibility of it
3242479 the effort to comprehend it causes the most tormenting dizziness we cannot conceive of ourselves as not existing
3242480 well it looks like brown mouse got eaten by mr alligator
3242481 in this study it seems the reason afterlife beliefs are so prevalent is that underlying them is our inability to simulate our nonexistence
3242482 we have a basic psychological capacity that allows anyone to reason about unexpected natural events to see deeper meaning where there is none
3242483 a new zest which adds itself like a gift to life an assurance of safety and a temper of peace and in relation to others a preponderance of loving affections
3242484 through countless generations of variation and selection organisms acquire properties that enable them to survive and reproduce in their environments my purpose is to see if human groups in general and religious groups in particular qualify as organismic in this sense
3242485 so i chose something as far as possible from literature i chose science
3242486 i was very ambitious and i wanted to make a mark
3242487 i thought wow defending group selection now that would be big
3242488 religion offered an opportunity to show that group selection was right after all
3242489 cannot in principle distinguish marxism from monotheism ideology from religious belief
3242490 they cannot explain why people can be more steadfast in their commitment to admittedly counterfactual and counterintuitive beliefs that mary is both a mother and a virgin and god is sentient but bodiless than to the most politically economically or scientifically persuasive account of the way things are or should be
3242491 the study of evolution is largely the study of trade offs
3242492 a symbolic belief system that departs from factual reality fares better
3242493 highly sophisticated mental modules for acquiring factual knowledge and for building symbolic belief systems
3242494 keeps social groups as a whole on an even keel
3242495 by donning several layers of clothing and standing out in the midday sun
3242496 the net of religion extends over questions of moral meaning and value
3242497 gould carried the art of bending over backward to positively supine lengths
3242498 why shouldnt we comment on god as scientists a universe with a creative superintendent would be a very different kind of universe from one without why is that not a scientific matter
3242499 even if gould was right that there were two domains what religion does and what science does
3242500 that doesnt mean science cant study what religion does it just means science cant do what religion does
3242501 an all knowing all powerful perfectly good god who brought the universe into being
3242502 i believe that the purpose for people is to love god and love each other
3242503 christian theology teaches that people were crafted by god to be in a loving relationship with him and other people
3242504 why wouldnt god then design us in such a way as to find belief in divinity quite natural
3242505 suppose science produces a convincing account for why i think my wife loves me should i then stop believing that she does
3242506 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3242507 until now our ability to represent the high latitude oceans and sea ice in oceanographic and climate models has suffered as a result
3242508 if we want to understand whats going to happen to climate in the future we need to know what the sea ice is going to do will there be more or less and will it form more or less rapidly
3242509 they measure temperature and salinity as a function of depth as they dive down and up through the water column
3242510 from that information we can determine what the ocean currents are doing and so they provide us with a very detailed record of how temperatures and salinitys changed

3242578 oh no you must have heard of father richard chin he was the pioneer priest the bishop sent him for training at our mother house in france and he retuned to start this house here unfortunately the lord called him home too soon and quite unexpectedly thereafter this place remained without a priest for about two years after his death and it was in 2003 that the bishop asked the vicar general to propose another priest to take over from father richard richard and i were classmates and good friends at the seminary so when the vicar general asked if i wanted to take over i said his wish was an order to me i was then sent for training at our mother house in france and in may this year i took my final commitment as the priest of the foyer

3242590 the fishermen had got out of them and were washing their nets he got into one of the boats it was simons and asked him to put out a little from the shore then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat
3242591 and i say to you you are peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it

3242648 the lion man has at last succeeded to emasculate the anglophone struggle in this country when gobata of all people decides to go the way all our brave men and women of the pen are going then theres no hope for us at all this is truly sad
3242649 of course it is your business its everyones business for crying out loud anyone who has the anglophone destiny at heart should be concerned that our valiant writers are all fleeing the struggle like frightened dogs with their tails between their legs this is truly tragic believe me

3242681 perhaps the the members of that department are merely scared of local material
3242682 one is at a loss as to why they seem to say nothing about any literary activity around here their silence is suspicious sic the department of african studies should make efforts at giving publicity to cameroon works that seems to me to be their sacred duty if they fail there where can we turn to surely giving publicity to such works or actually putting them in the curriculum would encourage local talent
3242683 bulan sabit itu adalah tanda tanda waktu bagi manusia dan bagi ibadat haji

3242685 sesungguhnya bilangan bulan pada sisi allah adalah dua belas bulan
3242686 dia lah yang menjadikan matahari bersinar dan bulan bercahaya dan ditetapkan nya manzilah manzilah tempat tempat bagi perjalanan bulan itu supaya kamu mengetahui bilangan tahun dan perhitungan waktu allah tidak menciptakan yang demikian itu melainkan dengan hak dia menjelaskan tanda tanda kebesaran nya kepada orang orang yang mengetahui
3242687 dan dia telah menundukkan pula bagimu matahari dan bulan yang terus menerus beredar dalam orbitnya dan telah menundukkan bagimu malam dan siang

3242692 you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am
3242693 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me
3242694 i won seven events if they had the 50m freestyle back then which they do now i probably would have won that too
3242695 phelps is almost identical to me hes a world record holder in all these events so he is dominating the events just like i did
3242696 we only wanted to talk about the problemsbetween the syariah and the civil jurisdictions
3242697 we wanted to address the issues for non converting parties the husbands and wives as well as the children of those who convert
3242698 these are real situations and we cant just ignore the problems that they are facing moreover as lawyers we are tasked to help resolve these complex issues
3242699 this forum never intended to question the special position of the malays or islam as the religion of the federation as enshrined in the federal constitution
3242700 never once were the organisers speakers or registered guests critical of islam
3242701 the forum should have been viewed objectively rather than emotionally
3242702 we can disagree with other peoples views but we cannot disallow others from voicing out their views moreover physical force must never be deployed to cause an objective discussion to cease
3242703 we have adequate laws to address any sensitive issue that could incite or create racial problems in the country
3242704 it is regrettable that threats were made against the organisers to stop the forum from continuing
3242705 ive always felt like we have the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett or management or whatever
3242706 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3242707 its been an interesting last month but i think our team has gotten pretty tight
3242708 the support from our teammates throughout the day today was definitely encouraging
3242709 i was just hoping i was going the right direction
3242710 i understand the attention around him his performance tonight and him playing tonight
3242711 but i saw aaron just like he is every day i thought he went out there he played with excellent energy which i always recall him playing with i think hes done a really good job being consistent and understanding that the microscope is on him
3242712 i can pretty confidently say that no other quarterback in the league has ever stepped into a situation that hes stepped into
3242713 but hes handled it tremendously he played extremely well tonight and you could tell the organization you can tell why they have confidence in him
3242714 once we got going we were sharp we were crisp we moved the ball effectively and got a couple of touchdowns
3242715 it was just good to just get that first game rust off and get some confidence on those last couple of drives and get ready for the next one
3242716 offensively we got off to a slow start but we picked up the pace as the half went on
3242717 im going to go out and have some fun like i always do every year
3242718 yall know how i am im going to have fun trust me
3242719 he looks like hes primed to go ahead and be the guy that we need
3242720 i dont think hes had the best luck in the world this year
3242721 im not thinking about my start six weeks from now
3242722 my main goal is to get us into the eighth inning with the lead and unfortunately i wasnt able to do it it was tough knowing we had a one run lead against a team like this that any one of them can hit a homer at any time i knew there wasnt much room for error with beckett hes a great proven pitcher and he had his a stuff today
3242723 its just frustrating for us to have danks pitch as well as he did and not come out of there with the win
3242724 we believe in our vision to offer a new ebay of contents and services
3242725 with these easy means to monetize your know how and expertise new professionals and artists will invest more time and efforts on the net
3242726 last years program was received so splendidly our members are elated that we have been able to bring patricia and rita back this years program entitled the silver tsunami are you prepared is expected to far exceed our expectations
3242727 as millions of baby boomers reach retirement the wave of the silver tsunami will threaten to engulf you if you are not prepared this workshop prepares you for the what where and why of what is needed for you and your family to age with grace
3242728 i always pitch for my family thats why im playing to help support them
3242729 youre tired and youre all those things but to be able to do that a day after having a baby is really special you get a little bit extra when youre in a situation like that
3242730 you just dont know how a young pitcher is going to react but he looked pretty calm when he walked to the mound
3242731 the problem is were not winning not the teams in front of us
3242732 nothing says we cant turn things around and win eight in a row its happened before and i dont see why it couldnt happen again
3242733 i pitched good enough to give us a chance to win but with two outs i walked the third baseman and hung a pitch
3242734 playing major league baseball playing against the yankees it doesnt matter what kind of sleep you get
3242735 theres plenty of adrenaline and i definitely used that to my advantage tonight
3242736 weve got to get rolling offensively thats the bottom line we have to turn things around quick
3242737 after reading one of them i felt compelled to raise awareness about the great sacrifice that was made by these men and women
3242738 it continues to this day as first responders suffer from the aftereffects its almost like radiation poisoning after a nuclear attack first come the initial victims and then those whove been poisoned by the clouds of lethal dust
3242739 and thats only whats been officially reported in medical records
3242740 there are a host of other ailments such as cancer diseases affecting vital organs and mental health issues
3242741 im a new yorker and should have known about this much sooner hold me up is probably one of the most personal songs i have ever written and i wanted steve john and all of the responders to know that they have my support
3242742 i think that if given the opportunity most people would want to contribute to this cause
3242743 heres their chance to help while the political end of this gets worked out
3242744 its amusing though most people think im dead but im not really im just out there
3242745 davy jones gets nostalgic and engages the listener on every word hes a great entertainer and the true talent on this weeks show hes also still petty cute
3242746 in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life we commend to almighty god our dearly departed brother and we commit this body to the ground earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust the lord bless us and keep us the lord make his face to shine upon us and be gracious unto us and grant us peace amen

3242752 it was cecilias idea to apply the technology to wine
3242753 when she spoke with people in the industry they would tell her they needed a quick way to determine the components of a wine without having to send it off to a lab
3242754 it should even be able to identify say a chardonnay regardless of whether it was grown in france or california
3242755 you could use it to verify that a wine was made from the proper grapes
3242756 for example there are only five authorized grapes for a rioja but lots of winemakers sneak in cabernet anyway this could help enforce the standards
3242757 this is a way for them to verify a vintage
3242758 wine is one of the most complex chemical substances out there and no human palate can quantify its makeup objectively this kind of electronic device can
3242759 the human palate is unable to detect that a wine is say 20 merlot a device with a full range would be an awesome tool for explaining the mystery of what goes into a wine
3242760 this kind of device is purely technical its the human palate that determines whether a wine is worth drinking
3242761 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country

3242802 when the project was conceptualized it was conceptualized with a subsidy
3242803 you cant do any of this stuff without a subsidy none of it makes sense
3242804 there was a commitment when steve leeper was the sports amp exhibition authority director that there would be no additional taxpayer money used in the development between the stadiums somebody has decided to change that rule thats not surprising given everything thats happened in the past year on this land
3242805 given that they were able to purchase the land at one fifteenth of its value at some point we have to question why all the benefits are being given to one developer for one piece of land
3242806 right now the land is sitting there it is generating zero revenue except parking revenue for the sports amp exhibition authority the steelers will buy the land at a value determined six years ago they will put up an entertainment facility that will pay sales tax back to the state liquor taxes back to the state real estate taxes back to the city county and school district and income taxes back to the city and the state

3242815 the batsmen did not put up a good show here and that probably cost us the series it was critical that the middle order got runs and there was not enough consistency from any of the batters and that is probably what cost us the game and the test match here
3242816 it was a good toss to win but the batsmen failed to capitalise on the early starts
3242817 having won the toss it was important to get a big score we got a good start but could not capitalise for a new batsman to go straightway and face two spinners it is never easy if they had converted the early starts it would have been a different story overall we did not play quality cricket to win the series

3242853 with this increase the number of those using a search engine on a typical day is pulling ever closer to the 60 of internet users who use email arguably the internets all time killer app on a typical day underscoring the dramatic increase over time the percentage of internet users who search on a typical day grew 69 from january 2002 when the pew internet amp american life project first tracked this activity to may 2008 when the current data were collected during the same six year time period the use of email on a typical day rose from 52 to 60 for a growth rate of just 15
3242854 these new figures propel search further out of the pack well ahead of other popular internet activities such as checking the news which 39 of internet users do on a typical day or checking the weather which 30 do on a typical day
3242855 those who are using search engines on an average day are more likely to be socially upscale with at least some college education and incomes over 50 000 per year they are more likely to be internet users with at least six years of online experience and to have their homes wired for fast internet connections younger internet users are more likely than older users to search on a typical day men are more likely than women to search on a typical day

3242875 la medida es positiva porque sirve para encontrarles un piso a los bonos despu s de la fuerte ca da de la semana pasada lo que interpretar el mercado es que el gobierno es un comprador de ltima instancia que est dispuesto a intervenir

3242881 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

3242885 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3242886 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3242887 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world

3242890 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3242891 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

3242909 the new record is called starting over for a reason
3242910 i wanted the title to be direct simple and set the tone for the album in this past year i experienced the unraveling of my marriage and the birth of my first son it was during this year that i wrote the material for the new record and performed over 150 shows more than ever i think its important to be as open and honest as possible both as a songwriter and as a person one positive side to the tumultuous year ive had is this new found freedom to say it as it is to admit who i am and where ive been faults and all i feel this is a total crossroads for me
3242911 i am making this record for me and them and i wanted them to see their record being made
3242912 cyclone is a hip hop song you hear it in clubs and its not the kind of song youd hear an acoustic songwriter singing i basically flipped it added some chords and arrangements that werent there rather than just trying to copy it theres no skill in that incidentally i noticed it was getting a lot of traffic on youtube one night i was looking on myspace and baby bash had written me a message there just to tell me he dug it and i found out later that a radio station in phoenix had picked up the song and had put it in rotation people were telling me they heard it on the radio i just decided have some fun with it
3242913 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3242914 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3242915 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3242916 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3242917 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3242918 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3242919 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3242920 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3242921 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3242922 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3242923 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3242924 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3242925 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3242926 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3242927 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3242928 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3242929 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3242930 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3242931 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3242932 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3242933 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3242934 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3242935 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

3242940 en este tema se produce mucha picaresca muchos conductores denuncian que el producto estaba defectuoso cuando lo que ha habido es un mal cumplimiento de las condiciones generales de uso y mantenimiento por eso hay que ser muy escrupulosos

3242944 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3242945 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3242946 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3242947 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3242948 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3242949 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3242950 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3242951 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3242952 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3242953 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3242954 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3242955 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3242956 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3242957 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3242958 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3242959 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

3242961 to be tied for most olympic gold medals of all time with those names is a pretty amazing accomplishment
3242962 being in lane 6 i knew the guys in the middle of the pool would have a hard time seeing me so i wanted to jump out in the first 100 to 150 and gain enough ground to hang on i knew tae hwan would have a good last 50 so i wanted to be more than a body length ahead by 150
3242963 right now i need to get some rest get some food in my system and get back to the village to prepare for wednesday
3242964 im eating a lot of pasta and pizza lots of carbs
3242965 and im sleeping a lot ive been waking up at 4 30 in the morning and then falling back to sleep it takes me a while to get up in the morning i am glad i will have extra recovery time tuesday night because i think that is crucial for the next few days
3242966 its certainly the greatest olympic relay race ive ever seen
3242967 to be tied for most olympic gold medals of all time with those names is a pretty amazing accomplishment
3242968 being in lane 6 i knew the guys in the middle of the pool would have a hard time seeing me so i wanted to jump out in the first 100 to 150 and gain enough ground to hang on i knew tae hwan would have a good last 50 so i wanted to be more than a body length ahead by 150

3242971 and im sleeping a lot ive been waking up at 4 30 in the morning and then falling back to sleep it takes me a while to get up in the morning i am glad i will have extra recovery time tuesday night because i think that is crucial for the next few days
3242972 its certainly the greatest olympic relay race ive ever seen
3242973 without a doubt its the great olympic moment ive ever experienced or called head and shoulders above anything and we have done some pretty good things
3242974 its just one of those rare moments that you get in this business to be a part of something like that and the fact that it now has a chance to continue one of the greatest olympic stories ever in michael phelps just makes it an even bigger moment
3242975 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3242976 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3242977 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3242978 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3242979 i was just sitting here following my own path to god when all of the sudden whammy the law of noncontradiction jumped up and bit me
3242980 if you must be a pluralist please dont call yourself a follower of jesus christ
3242981 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3242982 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3242983 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3242984 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3242985 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3242986 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3242987 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3242988 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3242989 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3242990 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3242991 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3242992 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3242993 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3242994 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3242995 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3242996 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3242997 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3242998 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3242999 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3243000 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3243001 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3243002 were going to have to win a lot of games
3243003 were going to have to win a lot of games
3243004 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3243005 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3243006 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3243007 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3243008 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3243009 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3243010 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3243011 who are open to doing something on the production side
3243012 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3243013 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3243014 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

3243018 they woke up this weekend and figured out that that ad resonated and they needed to do something about it
3243019 if the celebrity issue were not hurting them they would have ignored it
3243020 thank you for giving me the opportunity to serve the town and to work with such a dedicated and capable group of people as comprise the finance committee
3243021 i am very pleased that your health has improved and that you are now feeling well enough to resume a position on the fincom
3243022 i am confident that your extensive background in finance will again serve well the finance committee and our community
3243023 are confident that rockefeller is christian gerhartsreiter and the person named christopher chichester who was living in the los angeles area in 1985
3243024 he was aspiring to be an actor out there he was trying to get into the acting business and he thought it was a more appropriate name
3243025 there is nothing wrong with using aliases as long as you dont use it to defraud
3243026 they can do what they want with it but he doesnt remember anything he remembers nothing before 1993 except for little bits and pieces
3243027 the members of the cpw task force regret that the work of the past 20 months has not resulted in a consensus proposal we have spent countless volunteer hours in meetings and reviewing documents because we believe our individual communities and the southeastern region could benefit from developing the a d makepeace land holdings in an innovative way
3243028 since january of 2001 when the company presented two different master planned community concept plans the task force has consistently expressed its concerns that such alternative plans be at a density and intensity appropriate for the land and region provide quality open space that protects significant habitat minimize negative impacts in particular traffic and water degradation and fulfill economic development and fiscal projections
3243029 the task force communicated these concerns to the company in a february 4 2001 letter and at the many meetings held over the intervening months in hopes of negotiating compromises in these areas the task force met for several months in subcommittee groups to identify standards safeguards and criteria for a zoning bylaw
3243030 having invested considerable time in this process we are open to work with the company if it indicates a willingness to move beyond rhetoric to actual negotiation and consider a wider range of alternative development options in consideration of the best interests of our communities however we cannot endorse the zoning overlay district as presented
3243031 it is perhaps still too early to conclude that ppi growth has peaked
3243032 the sharp acceleration in producer price inflation seen in recent months is a concern to policymakers as this poses a strong upside risk to cpi consumer price index growth
3243033 in the next few months the authorities will likely further tighten monetary policy and impose price curbs to deal with this inflation risk
3243034 we have a speculative bubble in prices thats giving way to what now i think are more moderate levels
3243035 i think we can look forward to a resumption of an improvement in equity prices based on still good earnings coming out of many companies
3243036 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3243037 lenovo has engineered a new breed of mobile workstation with the thinkpad w700
3243038 no other pc manufacturer has a mobile workstation that delivers the sheer power performance and cutting edge innovation that lenovo has packed into the thinkpad w700 the thinkpad w700 mobile workstation flat out delivers the command performance our customers demand at the desk as well as in the field
3243039 our engineers use lenovo thinkstation workstations to help them design the next generation williams toyota fw31 race cars aiming to make them faster and more agile with greater performance than the competition
3243040 were thrilled to see lenovo deliver the workstation performance weve come to rely on now in a mobile portable solution
3243041 they always pass these authorizations with a lot of fanfare as if they are going to spend the money immediately but a lot of these bond bills are over five or ten years
3243042 there is the issue of giving false expectations that theyll be spent in the near term
3243043 you just cant keep spending and borrowing at that rate and expect that taxpayers are going to continue to pay higher taxes
3243044 borrowing so much that hes going to turn around and ask for a very large tax increase
3243045 the bonding is based very much on an affordability analysis
3243046 our capital plan is not a wish list there are some choices that we made
3243047 we can even speed it up if things get really great or slow it down if we hit a wall
3243048 its very much up to the administration to manage it in an effective manner
3243049 if you are irresponsible about that borrowing that can be a problem
3243050 depending on what happens in 2009 it could be a cause for concern
3243051 your revenues are declining and then youre carrying more debt so they need to be careful
3243052 the north koreans know what they have to do in putting together that regime
3243053 the north koreans know exactly what it is that we require
3243054 our policy is basically action for action and we need to see that verification regime and thats what we wait for
3243055 enough testing has been done because we are not getting anywhere
3243056 we just need to get this done i feel bad for the homeowners
3243057 mayor lang since you have taken office you have helped us a great deal
3243058 i for one am getting a little tired of these meetings
3243059 we must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people especially children to be victims
3243060 you need witnesses youve got to build a case and youve got to identify suspects
3243061 this is not something we take likely but given the incident of this weekend we need to take firm action and this is the kind of action thats required in order to ensure the safety of our residents
3243062 but this is aimed at helping young people in our city this is not an attempt to be punitive
3243063 the aclu of connecticut opposes juvenile curfews because theyre essentially a violation of fundamental rights of innocent people
3243064 curfews essentially are placing an entire demographic in this case youth under house arrest for the inappropriate actions of a few
3243065 son of kronus council president of troy father who gave us birth do you see these undeserved sufferings that your trojan people bear
3243066 he sees and yet the great city is no city it has perished and troy exists no longer
3243067 i will help you if i can i will kill you if i must i will kill you if i can i will help you if i must
3243068 it hurts i think its something that no one should ever have to go through
3243069 but lifes not fair so its never going to be about that at the end of the day it happened and it seems that the sooner we can come to grips with that and process it the better off were going to be
3243070 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence theres no indication here of any premeditation or anything
3243071 it seems just unfortunately a case of the wrong place at the wrong time
3243072 volleyball is my job my family is my life so that distinction has been very easy for me
3243073 clearly elisabeth is a victim in this as well obviously she physically was unscathed having to deal with this has been hard for her she has shown incredible strength the last couple of days weve been able to talk through it
3243074 obviously its a lot of tears and a lot of hugs
3243075 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
3243076 not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
3243077 we are extremely grateful for the outpouring of assistance and generosity that we have received and hope to convey our appreciation to everyone who has supported us and kept us in their thoughts and prayers
3243078 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3243079 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3243080 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3243081 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3243082 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3243083 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from taxes and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3243084 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3243085 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3243086 another nail in the coffin of the u s consumer who is already suffering from the weak labor market high inflation and falling house prices
3243087 the country is probably going through the most severe credit crunch since 1991 92
3243088 i think bank credit is going to remain tight for a while
3243089 now were focused on the weak demand side of the equation
3243090 there was this thought process that the high price of energy didnt matter to china and other countries but were finding that thats not the case
3243091 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3243092 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3243093 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3243094 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3243095 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3243096 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3243097 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3243098 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3243099 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3243100 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3243101 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3243102 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3243103 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3243104 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3243105 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3243106 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3243107 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3243108 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3243109 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3243110 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3243111 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3243112 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3243113 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3243114 i can tell you think im fussing at you and really that is not my intention im just trying to find a solution i appreciate your hard work
3243115 to every thing there is a season and a time to every purpose
3243116 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself

3243122 i seriously think the bull mastiff is a menace to society
3243123 when i saw this dog it scared the hell out of me as to what this dog is capable of
3243124 if you see this dog in town just one time please call the police

3243126 you could hear this noise and you knew it was wind but it sounded like a big truck or a freight train
3243127 the cloud passed right in front of us it was pretty thick so we couldnt see it hit the boats they all stayed on their moorings but they flipped
3243128 it was actually pretty cool and something i will probably never see again
3243129 we diverted all ambulances to other area hospitals and canceled all elective surgery and outpatient procedures
3243130 there is an awful lot of moisture in the atmosphere and it is all coming up from the south they have had similar conditions in new york and new jersey
3243131 we are just trying to shop vac it out now

3243133 the weather spotters have been going full bore north and south of boston the frequency of these thunderstorms has just been extraordinary
3243134 we are working on identifying the equipment and staffing we will need to establish a consistent part time local presence to handle walk in customer service issues

3243139 the kennedy name on cape cod in massachusetts is certainly one to be honored
3243140 you can have a first class merchant marine with first class men even if they sail second class ships
3243141 but second class men cannot be trusted with the finest ships afloat
3243142 they have tragically paid a price for their love of this country
3243143 senator kennedy has always been inspired by the exceptional students of mass maritime and their service on the sea
3243144 enterprise is a name that has a lot of tradition
3243145 the name kennedy holds much more tradition much more respect and reverence in massachusetts and the nation
3243146 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself

3243181 that we have somehow targeted his client for some unproven and presumably personal purpose is an extremely serious allegation that mr richter makes
3243182 the proposition that this is somehow a conspiracy is really well the evidence will speak for itself
3243183 the last of a line of lasts the pale princess of a palace cracked
3243184 this company is well positioned to take advantage of our significant asset base
3243185 we want to become the agricultural production powerhouse of australia
3243186 the cattle price is rising and there is what would appear to be very strong underlying demand for protein in the next six months onwards
3243187 its embryonic ideas that takes you out into other agribusiness
3243188 were good at feedlotting cattle the next extension of that is you say why beef cattle dairy cattle is obviously the next one
3243189 and when you talk about feedlotting animals of that quantity you need the crops to feed them so we can either grow the crops ourselves or rely on other farmers to do that for us
3243190 the thing australia has compared to say brazil or uzbekistan or any of those places is that we have a stable economy stable politics a currency thats tradable and a financial system that is one of the best in the world
3243191 its in process could be a while yet ill keep the market updated but i cant say too much about it
3243192 what were looking at doing is either forestry type carbon sinking which is one avenue
3243193 there is also reducing our own footprint thats methane gas reduction from cattle
3243194 mr samuel has for years been seeking to criminalise cartel conduct mr richter said
3243195 he wants to use this to advance his agenda to criminalise cartel conduct
3243196 they entrapped mr pratt into agreeing to the agreed facts
3243197 that we have somehow targeted his client for some unproven and presumably personal purpose is an extremely serious allegation that mr richter makes mr dean said
3243198 the proposition that this is somehow a conspiracy is really well the evidence will speak for itself hot in the city
3243199 its certainly hard not to be spooked by the currency and its really hard to know what the currency will do
3243200 its really hard to give guidance its better off not giving any guidance were trying to manage this business over the longer term
3243201 if we had the financial year 2007 exchange rates for financial year 2008 our sales line would have been 47 million more on the topline and about 20 million more net profit
3243202 the officer on friday night said the interim prime minister had called the police commissioner from china where he is at the olympic games and said he wanted an investigation into the story that we ran
3243203 that set off a chain of events which happened to end with the police sergeant turning up at a private function and demanding a statement
3243204 there are various arms of the administration and if they take offence they go to the extreme they send in a truckful of police and grab people for interviews
3243205 to help strengthen national unity and provide momentum for business leaders and all the people to make joint efforts to reinvigorate the economy and create new jobs
3243206 however i made the bold decision considering that business leaders face difficulties travelling abroad and they are being deterred from making new investment
3243207 this amnesty will only strengthen the public belief that the rich always get away with any wrongdoing
3243208 by tolerating corporate crimes the government has damaged the spirit of law observance which threatens the long term growth of the korean economy
3243209 the president thanks you for your untiring fight your strong fight to restore constitutional order
3243210 i asked the mauritanian officials for a meeting with former president but they rejected my demand but they assured me that he is in a good health and in good living conditions
3243211 they thought my father was malleable that they could dictate things to him but my father is a strong and firm man
3243212 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3243213 any of the campaigns that would have tried to push that would have been burned by it
3243214 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3243215 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3243216 the main concern is the economy and the steep fall in demand
3243217 it seems that the weakness in the us economy has now spread to europe and asia and i think thats what the main concern is
3243218 investors have to realise that if the situation escalates the shutdown in the ports could last a long time and this could start affecting supplies
3243219 drug use should be treated in the same way as alcohol and nicoteine sic which are both deadly drugs sold on shopping shelves and taxed to the hilt by every government
3243220 the worldwide web is an interesting beast and it provides great opportunity for information dissemination but also information distortion
3243221 that is policy nonsense to suggest wed be going there
3243222 in actual fact that is the antithesis of what we believe in when it comes to the issue of addressing the scourge of drugs
3243223 showing absolutely no indication theyre going to stop enriching uranium
3243224 it is clear that iran doesnt pay attention to talks iran is a threat not only to israel but this is a global threat
3243225 any kind of hesitation is being perceived by the iranians as weakness
3243226 you dont even give them 15 months necessarily you think its a more urgent matter
3243227 t he world cannot afford a nuclear iran and weapons of mass destruction everywhere in this region in the hands not only of states but also of terrorist organizations
3243228 i keep hope because i dont want to believe the other side of it
3243229 in my mind im still keeping up because i dont want to lose that hope im hoping theres someone in the country who knows where he is
3243230 im just looking everywhere and pleading for someone to help my son and find him
3243231 not at all not at all i dont think about that part of the park i know the police officers are trying to do their best to try and wipe out all the doubt because it was pretty cold and i dont believe he would be going there
3243232 the place he tries to go to is the childrens corner in the park theres a swing and slide and he used to go there and hes very fascinated by all these things
3243233 were just hoping this feeling wont last forever were just waiting for our son to come back to us
3243234 i keep hope because i don amp squo t want to believe the other side of it
3243235 what has been called the long war is likely to be many years of persistent engaged combat all around the world in differing degrees of size and intensity this generational campaign cannot be wished away or put on a timetable there are no exit strategies to paraphrase the bolshevik leon trotsky we may not be interested in the long war but the long war is interested in us
3243236 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u
3243237 the principal challenge therefore is how to ensure that the capabilities gained and counterinsurgency lessons learned from iraq and afghanistan as well as the lessons relearned from other places where we have engaged in irregular warfare over the last two decades are institutionalized within the defense establishment
3243238 take the battle to the enemy disrupt his plans and confront the worst threats before they emerge
3243239 a vivid and compelling demonstration of americas ability to win swift and total victory
3243240 unequaled in its excellence by anything in the annals of war
3243241 that far surpasses the capabilities of such previous would be hegemons as rome britain and napoleonic france
3243242 fabled generals such as erwin rommel and heinz guderian seem positively incompetent by comparison
3243243 weve applied the new powers of technology to strike an enemy force with speed and incredible precision by a combination of creative strategies and advanced technologies we are redefining war on our terms in this new era of warfare we can target a regime not a nation
3243244 the american people fell in love again with their armed forces
3243245 whats the point of having this superb military that youre always talking about if we cant use it
3243246 appropriated the entire earth and was ready to flood the most obscure areas of it with troops at a moments notice
3243247 just about no mission is impossible for the united states military
3243248 then walk out looking like kirk franklin you know something is wrong
3243249 its cool to bring something to life whether its a song or a video but to do it and have it embraced by millions like lost thats insane
3243250 i worked hardest to bring the tech and content communities together it is happening
3243251 i got the chance to put washington and silicon valley together we are seeing an apollo project of a new kind of politics being built right now
3243252 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3243253 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3243254 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3243255 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3243256 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3243257 i set up an opportunity to have a perfect swim tomorrow
3243258 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3243259 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3243260 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3243261 last year in melbourne at the world championships one swim started it and then swims just started happening one after another after another we had a great morning this morning and hopefully we can set up some more good swims tonight and keep the ball rolling

3243268 so what hes saying is hey im the guy in charge here im the person who decides what to do not you is that right
3243269 i think what he was saying was if i become president then ill be the person that calls the shots

3243289 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
3243290 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
3243291 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
3243292 it was clear that too many unmistakable israeli systems in the possession of the georgian army would be like a red cloth in the face of a raging bull as far as russia is concerned
3243293 the israeli is the main investor in the georgian economy everyone is there directly or indirectly

3243305 what are you going to do if this one has problems
3243306 claiming that us as well as nato and israeli military assistance to georgia is destabilizing the region according to the russian defense ministry
3243307 georgia has received 206 tanks of which 175 units were supplied by nato states 186 armored vehicles 126 from nato 79 guns 67 from nato 25 helicopters 12 from nato 70 mortars ten surface to air missile systems eight israeli made unmanned aircraft and other weapons in addition nato countries have supplied four combat aircraft to georgia the russian defense ministry said there were plans to deliver to georgia 145 armored vehicles 262 guns and mortars 14 combat aircraft including four mirazh 2000 destroyers 25 combat helicopters 15 american black hawk aircraft six surface to air missile systems and other arms

3243314 its hard it gets easy it gets fun again whats hard to sustain is some ideal that its perfect thats ridiculous whats fantastic about marriage is getting through those ebbs and flows with the same person and looking across the room and saying im still here and i still love you you re meet reconnect you have marriages within marriages within marriages thats what i love about marriage thats what i want in marriage its unfortunate but we live in a very disposable society those moments where it looks like uh oh this isnt working those are the most important transformative moments most couples draw up divorce papers when theyre missing out on an amazing moment of deepening and enlightenment and connection
3243315 hey barley whoa thar i jest seen me a acceedent

3243326 not that i have already obtained all this or have already been made perfect but i press on to take hold of that for which christ jesus took hold of me brothers i do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it but one thing i do forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead i press on toward the goal to win the prize for which god has called me heavenward in christ jesus
3243327 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
3243328 no that had to be the first time right there i was kind of rocked for a minute too i was just hoping i was going the right direction
3243329 it was an in route you know we got the right coverage that we wanted aaron rodgers threw it i knew i was going to get hit i didnt know how hard i was going to get hit i knew i was going to get hit though going through my head was just catch the ball and instead of tackling me he tried to take me out for good i stayed up on my feet and was able to get in the end zone
3243330 oh yeah i was rang for a minute like i said i was just praying i was going the right direction i was rang for a minute pretty good i had a little stinger but it was fine and was just glad i was able to get into the end zone
3243331 laughing i dont know i dont know i dont know i dont know thats for espn and all those type of guys to put that on that type of scale
3243332 laughing oh yeah so mines better then were better than jason witten here we went to the house
3243333 i think it was big every time we get the ball were trying to score were always telling ourselves make big plays we were able to connect and make a big play its definitely a booster for the offense get some momentum swinging on our side the defense was playing great whenever we can contribute and make a big play thats always good
3243334 we think we can be a lot better i think a lot better in every category obviously tonight there was times where we felt we played alright and then the bengals first group we let them drive on us toward the end and score so that was disappointing for us but we talk about all the time about being consistent stopping the run and tonight we didnt get that done as much as we can but we took a couple small steps forward at times and we have a quick turnaround going to san fran next week so were going to make sure we take the positives and take it into next week
3243335 of course i think this defense our expectations that we set for ourselves is very high we feel like the skys the limit for the number of impact plays we can make turnovers everything we can do we feel like we can set the tone of the game we want to do that and set our offense up to score some points
3243336 i thought aaron did a number of solid things there was a lot of productivity on offense i didnt like the start of the whole offense as a unit on the first series with a false start we had a mental error that resulted in a sack and we had a dropped ball for an interception but other than that i liked the tempo i thought the productivity was there i thought aaron did a good job with the mechanical part of the game i thought he threw the ball off his back foot with accuracy i liked his decisiveness i thought he put together a good performance for us to build off of now theres going to be things im sure tomorrow as there always is its a preseason game number one but well correct it accordingly and build on the positive and fix the things that need to be corrected
3243337 i would think its a starting point for both of our rookies we knew coming into the preseason that we had a lot of work to do there there are going to be things from my vantage point that brian brohm did some really good things from the game and well build off of that he was in a bad spot there on his first play of the game with the interception the route progression wasnt what it was supposed to be and thats something where you have to have the discipline to move on to the next receiver he will definitely learn from that situation but once again the productivity was there was it clean no it wasnt clean but theres a number of factors going on well get that cleaned up and i think it was a very good first solid first step for the whole quarterback position
3243338 i think it went pretty well i did some good things out there made some plays the receivers did a great job james jones had a fantastic catch donald driver breaking tackles and i think the line protected for the most part very well there were some mistakes out there weve got to clean them up and hopefully get better for saturday
3243339 it felt great its nice when you throw not a great pass and youve got a guy who can catch it break two tackles lose the helmet and score a touchdown
3243340 it was a good night the reception from the fans the signs i saw in the stands were very positive and encouraging
3243341 ive always felt like weve got the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett favre or management or whatever it was a great reception when we took the field and when we scored the touchdown the fans were in it the whole game and it feels great to be able to look up in the stands and see the support and the signs and stuff it definitely means a lot to you
3243342 it definitely had a different atmosphere we had 70 000 fans couldnt get the camera out of my face in pregame it was all over me it definitely had a different feel but we prepared the same way as any other game

3243358 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3243359 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3243360 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3243361 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3243362 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3243363 i set up an opportunity to have a perfect swim tomorrow
3243364 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3243365 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3243366 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3243367 last year in melbourne at the world championships one swim started it and then swims just started happening one after another after another we had a great morning this morning and hopefully we can set up some more good swims tonight and keep the ball rolling
3243368 i just wanted to win my heat and set everything up for tomorrow
3243369 just get through that and prepare myself for tomorrow thats the most important thing an afternoon off and its time to just sort of get as rested as i can recover and i probably have to re shave get all of that stuff down

3243376 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3243377 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3243378 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3243379 mr samuel has for years been seeking to criminalise cartel conduct
3243380 he wants to use this to advance his agenda to criminalise cartel conduct
3243381 they entrapped mr pratt into agreeing to the agreed facts
3243382 that we have somehow targeted his client for some unproven and presumably personal purpose is an extremely serious allegation that mr richter makes
3243383 the proposition that this is somehow a conspiracy is really well the evidence will speak for itself
3243384 she fucking hates me trust she fucking hates me la la la love i tried too hard and she tore my feelings like i had none and ripped them away
3243385 my shadows the only one that walks beside me my shallow hearts the only thing thats beating sometimes i wish someone out there will find me till then i walk alone
3243386 oh waves of time seem to wash away the scenes of our crimes but for you this never ends
3243387 can you stay strong can you go on kristy are you doing okay a rose that wont bloom winters kept you dont waste your whole life trying to get back what was taken away
3243388 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

3243390 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3243391 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3243392 well i watched a show on abc about that and it seems to me that they were just born in the wrong body i hope they can make it right for themselves
3243393 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3243394 just to give you fair warning supposedly the house stinks real bad because the people smoked really bad and they had cats and dogs and the ac hasnt been run in about a year so it might stink in there

3243407 in the drc there are major challenges in terms of resources and lack of infrastructure but we see that there is a political will to move forward and to organize the local elections as soon as possible
3243408 there is a general consensus that the local elections are very important not only to complete the electoral cycle but to go forward to legitimize local authority and the decentralization process
3243409 the local elections are more complicated to organize for technical and operational reasons the number of electoral constituencies is much larger and that complicates all the logistics preparations the numbers of candidates are also multiplied by 10 and the operations of registering of candidates are much more difficult
3243410 the week before i left i was thinking my god what did i get myself into

3243416 the college brochures dont show students crying or breaking up with significant others

3243420 whenever youre busy you dont have time to think about home and homesickness so you just keep moving
3243421 living in the freshman dorms i think is really good experience
3243422 because you dont have any privacy sometimes but its such a good time
3243423 school is very important but get out and have some fun and experience the college life dont just sit in your room all day and study do everything you can to live it up
3243424 i dont think its realistic for students to know exactly what they want to do you should come into it in your own time
3243425 the first impressions you get may not always be accurate everyone has a story and everyone comes from somewhere

3243435 people can get so isolated in their own little pockets its important to find ways to get people involved

3243437 i hope they band together as a small community to provide opportunities for other kids to get outside

3243481 we continue to try to work with them on this question of a robust verification regime
3243482 but we arent at the point where we are satisfied with what they have put on the table thus far

3243537 ive learned some of lifes most valuable lessons from preschool children to greet each day with enthusiasm and eagerness to pursue adventure despite obstacles to delight in new discoveries to enjoy spontaneous fun to regard the eating of toothpaste and the emptying of sand filled shoes on the carpet as minor problems not major catastrophes
3243538 a little bit of shock and probably more relief i guess
3243539 it has been a long journey its been a long eight years

3243541 an olympic gold is an olympic gold it really didnt matter how it went how i raced i couldnt care less
3243542 i woke up and i was just so excited i think i was excited about racing

3243603 he added khmer and vietnamese merchants always come to buy monkeys for between riel 450 000 approx us 110 and riel 500 000 approx us 125

3243615 the park service does not have land use control over private land within its boundaries
3243616 but sometimes the park service gets confused it thinks its a great agency because it manages great places
3243617 the zoning changes and it used to be farmland and now its commercial development
3243618 and its a case where we could have acted and bought land five or 10 years ago and it would have never happened
3243619 when they drew the lines to create yellowstone it was a group of men sitting in an office in washington d c with a map and a ruler
3243620 when people visit the big parks they dont get the fact that the federal government doesnt own all the land
3243621 were going to push hard over the next five years for a commitment to protect these parks for future generations by buying these lands
3243622 you can have all the rangers in the world but if theyre interpreting a townhouse development it doesnt do much good
3243623 admitting ones mistakes is a hard thing for anyone to do and i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
3243624 we cannot implement the pay raises without an appropriation but more importantly i am of the opinion that this is no time for pay raises

3243633 so i told the coach i wanted to play football but it was really just so i could take my pads and helmet to school
3243634 money was tight we didnt have the things a lot of people had
3243635 i grew up in the city and all of a sudden i was in the country
3243636 i drove by a bunch of cows and horses and said what am i doing out
3243637 going to class it was all these different people the way they talked the way they acted i was already bigger than most of the offensive linemen id go to class and they were like who is
3243638 you learn that youre only given a certain number of chances
3243639 if you keep going back to the same things you were doing it shows that you dont learn from anything youre not a person that people can count on its all about respect and you can lose that respect people wont look up to you
3243640 you sure you want me rey maualuga not taylor mays not brian cushing
3243641 you know people expect me to be this ferocious hitter this ferocious guy who goes out and gets drunk and beats people up its just something im trying to change i dont go out as much i just go out with friends come home early and go to sleep im trying to change that perception of me
3243642 i didnt know him his freshman year when some things happened
3243643 rey has done a marvelous job of putting his world in order
3243644 hes a very good student he works out like crazy hes diligent hes a wonderful kid in the program
3243645 we struggled with him through the illness and passing of his father he took it so seriously he just needed us there was a necessity to have a close relationship
3243646 i mean its life stuff happened he needed some support he was away from his family and all that but now hes just found a real good rhythm im really excited to see his growth and maturity
3243647 because he gave me a bloody lip last year i dropped back and former usc defensive end lawrence jackson got a hold of me i kind of got away from him but as soon as i turned around rey was right there and hit me good right up under the chin
3243648 hes probably the most feared guy in the pac 10
3243649 i want to be a person the offense game plans around
3243650 i want to see that quarterback stare into my eyes with both him and me knowing i might take him out i want people to fear me but at the same time i want to just do my job and not go outside of what im supposed to be doing
3243651 if i can come out this year and do exactly what i did in the rose bowl each game i can do some great things i have to have that mind set every practice every down if im tired i have to keep competing keep playing
3243652 is it possible yes why cant i do that every game
3243653 ive done some different things this offseason to try to get better and try to improve
3243654 that was basically the extent of the conversation i did a lot of speed agility and lateral movement a lot of explosive stuff to try and get quicker and move around a little better
3243655 youll see the rules get to a point where you could argue theyre standardized
3243656 our players are going out now past the international line
3243657 i dont see that eventually going to 23 9 being a problem
3243658 weve seen one example in the wnba where theyve gone from a longer clock to the 24 second clock fairly seamlessly having seen it work there the likelihood of it working in the ncaa and maintaining the quality of the game getting quality shots and quality plays i think is good
3243659 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3243660 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3243661 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3243662 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3243663 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3243664 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3243665 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3243666 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3243667 abhinav picked up the sport when he was only 12 and at that time no one knew shooting in india we sent him to germany for training then i got him a personal shooting range here in chandigarh i am extremely happy that he has made the country and his parents proud today
3243668 vermicompost is incredibly rich in humus earthworms eat cow dung or farm yard manure along with other wastes and pass it through their body this process converts soil and manure to vermicompost it has great value as an organic fertiliser
3243669 in the developed world there is a lot of concern about finding an environmentally friendly way of getting rid of refuse earthworms are helpful in converting municipal waste non toxic solids and household garbage into vermicompost they not only convert garbage to manure but also keep the environment healthy

3243673 we discussed the issues raised by the people of jammu and kashmir the deliberations are incomplete we will take what steps are to be taken on the matter with fellow leaders and the prime minister

3243676 i texted him today telling him how proud i was of how hes handled himself in this situation
3243677 thats not easy to do youre scrutinized over everything you do people follow you around you answer the same question over and over again from everything ive seen hes done a really nice job of keeping his poise and composure and really focusing on the job at hand and thats being the quarterback of that team
3243678 i got a chance to watch his first three series monday and i thought he was really sharp he showed great command he threw great balls two of them were dropped one was off a guys chest and the other was dropped on third and 17 or something like that he just looked great i thought he looked very comfortable and it seemed like they were all working together im just really excited for him i think hes going to have a great year
3243679 theyre throwing me in there little by little im going hard but ive got to recover from going hard and my body im getting kind of old now man the body doesnt hold up as well as it used to
3243680 peter geurts has just been a warrior the guy is all beat up and he just continues to play and is very solid
3243681 the receivers didnt do a very good job today i thought we dropped too many balls we need to focus more and that may be because were wearing down a bit but weve got to push through it were through practice 10 now and weve got to get over the hump to get to our first scrimmage on thursday
3243682 the corners made a couple plays today syd thompson is pretty solid all the time but i thought the quarterbacks left the ball in the air a little too long and the corners did a nice job of going after them we had some guys open we just werent real sharp today in the passing game

3243689 i went there a couple of times and its beautiful without asking me and i never did anything there i never saved anybodys life they said we are putting a statue up of you in town i thought it was a joke
3243690 ive got my sports jacket on corduroy trousers i have a photograph of it at home with two feet of snow piled on my head

3243699 so it wasnt really thinking about any of them i think you get more energy if youre not specific
3243700 everybody went home and said hes a monster this is going to be absolutely impossible then we realized as we went along that he is a leader and he is an artist

3243722 in essence if we dont really believe that will translate into success in this ballpark and thats very key then it doesnt make sense to do it
3243723 youre better off bringing someone who has been trained in a minor league system major league spring training has experience in the ballpark and understands the value of two seam sink on a pitch changeup behind on the count all the things it takes in order to translate to success out here at this park
3243724 as many years and the success hes had hes told me hes a little nervous and too excited
3243725 at this point now hes had a few days to sit back and get healthier and youll see better at bats out of him

3243730 im just looking everywhere and pleading for someone to help my son and find him
3243731 not at all not at all i dont think about that part of the park i know the police officers are trying to do their best to try and wipe out all the doubt because it was pretty cold and i dont believe he would be going there
3243732 the place he tries to go to is the childrens corner in the park theres a swing and slide and he used to go there and hes very fascinated by all these things
3243733 were just hoping this feeling wont last forever were just waiting for our son to come back to us
3243734 i keep hope because i dont want to believe the other side of it
3243735 from your comment about economic conditions and the outlook you obviously believe stock prices are high why dont you sell stocks with the idea of repurchasing at lower prices the businessman also should be aware of a problem confronting open end investment company managements

3243742 i train my body to do those movements more to where it comes natural rather than just relying on my arm to back up roll out and wing it to step up and create those passing lanes will definitely help
3243743 hes a versatile guy and he gets the job done

3243752 a very short staged recording of jamey being released from prison a symbolic expression of how he is finally able to do things his way and how he has been able to conquer the demons that have haunted him physically and mentally over the years
3243753 which takes no backroads while explaining mercilessly the effects that drug abuse and self torture can have on your life and how hard it can be to turn it all around
3243754 which has jamey posing as a man destroying the last little bits of what is left of a tortured love and
3243755 contains the same upbeat feel and shows an autobiographical look into johnsons attempt to make it this far in his career
3243756 is a powerful and emotional tribute to jameys grandfather and combines loneliness and recollection for a realistic and relative result
3243757 allows jamey to pay homage to the literal power and significance of old time country music in both todays and yesterdays worlds and how it seems to be hard to find the next person to pass that on using his hero waylon jennings as a name drop to help explain his point
3243758 the second to last track jamey begins to draw the album to a close in another personal and seemingly autobiographical clip that has his mother reminding him of what there is off the stage and outside the world of nashville record labels and radio airplay
3243759 is a fabulous song with johnson urging his former lover to return not forcing her but simply explaining that if she needs anywhere to run to or if her new life goes wrong the door is always open for her to return to him
3243760 is another song of lost love and personal pain as johnson sings to his characters lost love not asking for her back but simply releasing his feelings stating that he will move on someday but will always wish he was dreaming his dreams with her there to support him
3243761 i think ucf is a good opportunity for me to get to the next level there is so much speed in florida i really like the city of orlando as well

3243763 united approached diebold when they couldnt show any financial results
3243764 everyone assumed that diebolds finances were getting worse not better now that we know that the results are getting much better united would have to come in with an offer of at least 50 to 52 per share
3243765 it seems that united shareholders werent excited about the deal at 40 per share
3243766 i would assume theyd be less excited if the bid was any higher
3243767 everyone assumes banks are in such dire straits that theyll stop all spending
3243768 but at least large u s banks are buying more atms than they did last years as they upgrade to machines with envelope free deposits
3243769 youve probably noticed that were having a problem with our air conditioning thats because were experiencing a cabin pressure issue theres no danger the planes flying normally but we cant climb to our scheduled cruising altitude of 36 000 feet because we cant pressurize the cabin were troubleshooting the problem with our mechanics on the ground and well let you know more as the situation develops
3243770 we had to turn around because we didnt have enough fuel to fly to kansas city at 9000 feet
3243771 you mean they dont fill the tanks to the brim every time we go up

3243820 convinced the time is now upon us that some big events are about to occur
3243821 these fast approaching events will not go unnoticed they will affect all of us they will not be limited to just some areas of our country the world economy and political system will share in the chaos about to be unleashed
3243822 there are reasons to believe this coming crisis is different and bigger than the world has ever experienced instead of using globalism in a positive fashion its been used to globalize all of the mistakes of the politicians bureaucrats and central bankers
3243823 our arrogance and aggressiveness have been used to promote a world empire backed by the most powerful army of history this type of globalist intervention creates problems for all citizens of the world and fails to contribute to the well being of the worlds populations just think how our personal liberties have been trashed here at home in the last decade

3243832 have we not learnt from the results of the last general election
3243833 the rakyat has voiced an expectation of their leaders to represent all races and to uphold the rule of the law in spite of that voice we see leaders attempting to justify the protest and the infringement of the law
3243834 the fact remains that on one side the bar council was lawfully holding a forum in its own premise and on the other was a mob hurling racial abuses which were seditious and unlawful do we even know if the protestors had a police permit and if so why was it given
3243835 the rakyat will also wonder why the police force which proved effective in dispersing demonstrations of over 10 000 people were this time unable to contain a 300 strong mob
3243836 the vociferous presence of the representatives of umno pas and pkr and the insensitive statements that they made is a sad reflection of the racial and religious divisions in our society 50 years after merdeka
3243837 dap condemns such near violent behaviour and welcomes the disciplinary action taken by the respective pr parties as announced to prevent prs image from being tarnished and dragged down to the same level as umno
3243838 i want to throw a challenge to the prime minister amend the law to show you are sincere about resolving the issue and dont dolak dalik be wishy washy and pretend there are all kinds of reasons you cant do it
3243839 if you really want to resolve the issue amend the constitution
3243840 conversion to islam article 121 1a of the federal constitution subashini and shamala revisited
3243841 we can amend that section to say even the party who converts should be allowed to apply for divorce
3243842 as it is now you can do this under the civil law provided the non muslim spouse applied but if you amend it to let the muslim spouse to also apply maybe he or she can then resolve issues with a non muslim spouse before entering into another marriage that is what he or she should do
3243843 islam does not condone the behaviour of abandoning your family and certainly we as muslims do not want anybody to make use of islam to get out of their obligations that would be wrong
3243844 from the perspective of islam if we explain the right things to the non muslims they would not be afraid or worried and will understand islam better but if we act harshly and rudely like some of those who came to stop the forum people will think this is what islam is
3243845 you represent umno i represent the muslims muslims must act based on the quran and sunnah sayings of the prophet we must behave well muslims must not be rude im ashamed of your behaviour islam does not condone this
3243846 he said if i sit down means i am supporting this the fact is if you sit down it means you are listening and you can contribute and explain things to people it does not necessarily mean you agree with any views that are posed on islam
3243847 from our family to your family jesus is all we got
3243848 man u shoulda said k you i hope you rot you stupid ch
3243849 the forum was a frank peaceful and amicable effort that should be encouraged
3243850 in a multiracial democratic nation such as malaysia the government and civil society must at all times encourage open dialogue and discussion in a peaceful informative and sincere manner this will aid in establishing a deeper understanding amongst the rakyat
3243851 an i hate myself for falling in this far every minute wana be where you are put my fist through the wall cause its so damn clear well im holdin on cause its so hard to let go driven by your house starin at your window when you close your blinds and look down here youll see the loser of the year
3243852 we have to speak to the stakeholders in this issue we cannot drop the issue just because of pressure
3243853 we have reiterated many times in all our press statements that we do not question article 121 1 a of the federal constitution we accept the position and the rule of article 121
3243854 we believe the issue is that of freedom of expression if you cannot hold a meeting in a peaceful manner i do not think we are mature enough to call ourselves a democratic society
3243855 if the bar council cannot organise such a forum then who is to organise such a forum this is not a sectarian forum being held in a church temple or mosque this is a forum organised by the council involving everybody
3243856 we did not hold the forum in a football stadium or dataran merdeka it was held in the council auditorium
3243857 any nation with two systems of law will face problems but that does not mean the problems cannot be solved
3243858 the first step to solving problems is to hear what the issues are we need to understand the views of the muslims why they take that position we need to understand the views of the non muslims as well before we impose a solution
3243859 there were many things that could have been discussed to know how to go forward with these issues conflict of laws we have no problem listening to proposed solutions we need to explore all solutions and proposals
3243860 you need to understand the problems faced by the people through open sharing
3243861 baby who turned the temperature hotter cause im burnin up burnin up for you baby
3243862 is released today and is expected to do very well thanks to the
3243863 im a one man show i dont need no one
3243864 its great to see some innovative new plastics being released
3243865 another ideal method for their use has been to hook them on a 2 0 hook paternoster style rig in the same way as surf poppers in place of a second bait when targeting salmon and tailor etc
3243866 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3243867 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran over elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilians alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3243868 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3243869 we have never been and will never be a passive observer in the region
3243870 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3243871 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran over elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilians alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3243872 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3243873 we have never been and will never be a passive observer in the region
3243874 the people are asking with this outcome that their leaders find a way to reach an accord
3243875 we reiterate our support for bolivias unity and territorial integrity and remain committed to be a good partner in bolivias journey to a more democratic prosperous future
3243876 evo should be declared president of all the indians of this continent
3243877 the people are asking with this outcome that their leaders find a way to reach an accord
3243878 we reiterate our support for bolivias unity and territorial integrity and remain committed to be a good partner in bolivias journey to a more democratic prosperous future
3243879 evo should be declared president of all the indians of this continent
3243880 actually gonna start rappin people dont know that but i told him if he dont get good enough by the time we do our next album he aint gettin no verses though
3243881 the north koreans know what they have to do in putting together that regime
3243882 the north koreans know exactly what it is that we require
3243883 our policy is basically action for action and we need to see that verification regime and thats what we wait for
3243884 the north koreans know what they have to do in putting together that regime
3243885 the north koreans know exactly what it is that we require
3243886 our policy is basically action for action and we need to see that verification regime and thats what we wait for
3243887 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3243888 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3243889 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3243890 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3243891 my wife and i just got back from 3 weeks in thailand and found your backpacks to both of good design and good quality and would gladly recommend them to anyone regards bob
3243892 i received the backpack last night thank you so much for your prompt shipping i was afraid that i wouldnt receive it in time for my trip so what a relief yay also the backpack is even better than expected i will leave a positive feedback on your ebay and if anybody asks where i got such a fancy bag ill spread the good word thanks again lily
3243893 it is taking a little bit longer than originally expected
3243894 i think everybody felt it was kind of a breakout year for him
3243895 ive heard his name a lot not like somebodys beating my door down but if you look at the reports hes done well
3243896 this seems like a really good opportunity to let him pitch hes been throwing the ball well the idea will be to slow the rangers down a little bit
3243897 now its finally to the point where im not ever worried about throwing a ball full counts ill throw a knuckleball still i dont worry about walking people anymore
3243898 a lot of it is me just having to believe in it i always wanted to go back to throwing hard now i know i cant do that anymore so i have to be able to figure it out to throw consistent knuckleballs up there that will move and hopefully not get hit hard
3243899 he pitches a lot like wake as far as he throws his knuckleball for strikes when he gets behind 2 and 0 3 and 1 he is still committed to throwing a knuckleball thats big if youre not doing that you are going to get in trouble throwing 80 mile per hour fastballs
3243900 i think tom kind of concurred with what everybody else thought
3243901 it was probably a good idea that he not pitch we maybe hopefully stayed ahead of this thing and that given the few days down from throwing get him back up and get him back there was nothing that stood out structurally or anything like that on the mri
3243902 i think weve really been so committed to this guy and i understand were seeing it too
3243903 last year when he was pitching against baltimore it looked so easy well right now its not easy youre playing good major league teams and theyre doing everything in their power to find a way to exploit anything you do
3243904 so were kind of trying to balance trying to help and not beating him over the head with stuff thats actually not the easiest thing but were spending some time talking to him about things just trying to make progress
3243905 instead of trying to get in that rhythm of attacking the strike zone
3243906 id like to play him every single day because hes a big threat but i think we both thought it was the right day not to play
3243907 we currently have enrolled 1 899 kindergarten students and thats up 57 students from sept 30 last year
3243908 and we have 27 students enrolled in half day kindergarten district wide and thats an afternoon session
3243909 last year the average size of a class in kindergarten was 22 74 students
3243910 currently as we stand right now it is 23 44 so we have gained only 3 4 of a student
3243911 when it was all said and done most of our all day kindergarten teachers are from our own buildings they are not new to 204
3243912 in fact we hired four new teachers and all the rest are people who were just excited for the opportunity and asked to be moved
3243913 we are going to have access to the curriculum and instruction and be able to go deeper and improve student learning
3243914 so we have set a lofty but attainable goal that 90 percent of our kindergartners will meet or exceed expectations on several assessments so well have a point of comparison
3243915 i am pleased that we are on course in terms of education that the kids achievements are driving the budget
3243916 this years budget shows how rising fuel costs are affecting school districts
3243917 last fiscal year we supplemented out travel budget by 582 000 to cover increasing fuel costs in this budget we have increased our request to 3 million for fuel
3243918 we have opened a criminal investigation and are investigating it thoroughly
3243919 we want to do it with renewable energy because after the initial payback with installation theres no cost
3243920 all these schools are saying this would really help us in controlling our costs since the state has been somewhat irresponsible in funding us at 31 percent
3243921 as a coalition we are more likely to achieve the gold standard for breast feeding rates for kane county which will help us reach our goal of having the healthiest residents in illinois by 2030
3243922 it is my desire to broaden the scope of korean cinema and add to its different colours
3243923 then it may provide some reassurance to nervous investors that local audiences are still interested in korean films
3243924 if youre an existing business and people are going to build houses around you and complain the noise ive got a problem with that
3243925 if they were there first and people move around them knowing its a business i have a problem telling them what time they can do deliveries you can work with them talk to them but to force them to do it i have a problem with that
3243926 if its causing a problem for the residents then its causing a problem for the residents
3243927 putting it back the way it was for 100 years definitely will help
3243928 i think ive counted six people in a day using the bike lane tops no one uses the thing
3243929 its always difficult when its the first project in a plan
3243930 sometimes the owner of a building and the business operator are two different people
3243931 with anything that is brand new there are opportunities to step back and reflect as to what could and should be modified this clearly is an example of such reflection
3243932 for whatever i am and will become i owe it to my mother
3243933 second shelf is mine thats where i keep my rootbeers and my double thick oreo cookies nobody touches the second shelf but me
3243934 it is a sad thing if a rich man has no heir to his property
3243935 the bigbelly is a trash receptacle that is totally solar powered the bigbelly can take up as much space as the normal trash receptacle but can accommodate up to five times more than the normal receptacle this feature will lessen the pick up interval of the waste collection truck and will eventually help lessen green house gas emission however too much amount of wastes may cause some foul odors and will eventually cause some air pollution but if something can be done to avoid the spread of foul odor then the bigbelly is top notch perfect for school campuses and public places
3243936 the greencore 10200 comes in two models a fixed one and a mobile version which can be had with 2 or 4 batteries using a single 170 watt solar panel it can keep a 600 square foot room cool one of the good design decisions was to make it run on dc current so no ac inverter is needed and conversion losses are avoided
3243937 when asked about how many people lived in the building he comments from unverified accounts will be reviewed twice daily
3243938 if i can be the same shut down guy i was its all olympic size ice then maybe i can get back some of the skill and finesse i used to have
3243939 i didnt want to be one of those guys who goes over to europe to finish his career it might be a step forward for me
3243940 they called me up around mid season and i stayed up to the end of the year
3243941 if it was a different type of organization i would have signed but the way theyre going theyre giving the younger guys a shot
3243942 after the season i had 53 games and was named the teams most underrated player i didnt want to start the season in the minors the role i played they were going to start giving the younger guys a chance
3243943 a lot of these guys i was on their b list i was a safety valve for a lot of teams
3243944 i said jimmy are you kidding me i didnt want to do it
3243945 he fish told me something still might happen in the nhl but it probably would be a two way deal
3243946 he told me hed ease me into it its exciting i cant wait for it to start hopefully i can hang with these guys
3243947 rivalry week at southern new hampshire university while plans are underway to expand the league to five geographical locations next summer including one in nashua
3243948 there may be students who already have a certain line of expectations
3243949 theyre representing the school and with that comes some responsibility
3243950 i think you could safely say there are hundreds of illegal apartments throughout the city of nashua
3243951 you will be in a certain place and you know right off the bat that it is illegal
3243952 we get a hold of the landlord and say listen you cant have this here
3243953 unfortunately there has never been an attempt to push the matter beyond these written notices except in the case of certain building violations
3243954 due to its failure for more than a quarter of a century to enforce the ordinances it now seeks to apply the city is estopped from enforcing the ordinances it now seeks to enforce
3243955 they know i go to florida for the first three months of the year
3243956 i really try to look at this without saying they are after me but it seems more than a reasonable ratio of inspectors at my buildings
3243957 with the exception of bridge street the number of units in my buildings havent changed in 20 years
3243958 they involve installation of electrical plumbing and heating systems without permits and no inspections are done by the city to make sure that these systems are installed in a safe manner
3243959 then they were going after me for the building that i had already spent a lot of money fixing up
3243960 the city has a history of doing this and then not following up on it
3243961 there werent enough units in the city and they were going after these illegal apartments
3243962 people stood up and were clamoring about it because there werent enough units
3243963 but it would mean that 12 families would be forced out you dont want to condemn the building
3243964 that is one of the only ones he has left to do
3243965 the trend is that we have lost some ground against concentrated poverty
3243966 reversal of fortune a new look at concentrated poverty in the 2000s
3243967 very poor neighborhoods tend to have under performing schools higher crime rates less private investment in these communities and less job opportunities for people living there
3243968 this really points to the importance of the overall economy in making progress against concentrated poverty
3243969 when i flipped at the 50 and saw how far ahead he was the thought crossed my mind for a split second theres no way
3243970 i got a supercharge and took it from there it was unreal
3243971 his last 50 were absolutely incredible he had a perfect finish
3243972 theres never been a split like this in my memory not running down somebody who holds the world record whos on their game that was incredible
3243973 the 400 free relay has been spanked around the last two olympics this was the toughest one to win those are always the best ones to win
3243974 havent we allowed you the right to worship in your synagogue
3243975 havent we let you live in peace with your fellow jews
3243976 havent we allowed you to travel freely within and beyond the village
3243977 les pido a los prefectos que depongan sus actitudes radicales y trabajemos juntos hay que dejar de lado las ofensas y las agresiones el refer ndum nos obliga a ponernos de acuerdo
3243978 ser amos ciegos en no reconocer la victoria del presidente por primera vez el presidente no ha insultado ni ofendido y eso puede dar alguna esperanza ojal margine a los radicales y les d m s participaci n a los dialoguistas
3243979 autonom as para los pueblos pero no para unas pocas familias
3243980 i tell people its there now avail yourself of what is
3243981 seemed to be a few more customers on the weekend
3243982 she was told it would be part of the national campaign
3243983 i was told by mr hudson that mr goudies campaign would be receiving money from the conservative party of canada for advertising
3243984 i thought mr hudson was going to send us money to help out with local advertising but then he said that the money would be coming in to mr goudies campaign from the conservative party of canada but would be going right back out to the conservative party of canada
3243985 its going to be the wal marts of the world that will buy these things over acres and make a difference
3243986 the resulting solar acreage would roughly equal the size of manhattan an island of 23 square miles
3243987 4 million to 6 million for a store the size of a wal mart
3243988 who has examined plans said the day might come when people can pull their electric cars up to a store and re charge them with power from the roof or even from wind turbines in the parking lot
3243989 i just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in georgia i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening the georgian capital tblisi
3243990 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3243991 would be inconsistent with assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited
3243992 nbc has a lot at stake both in terms of the event and a promotional platform for a new television season
3243993 i would think if i were nbc right now id be very pleased its still early but judging off these ratings theyre in very good shape
3243994 they have a lot of big commitments to huge advertisers what else were they going to do
3243995 i dont think there is a corporate halo that carries over because i liked the olympics on nbc i will watch nbc programming i dont think it works that way
3243996 but when they run the promotions on the fall lineup
3243997 was keenly aware of the hidden security presence in the center every morning she felt those tired eyes upon her and was hyperconscious of her every movement the constant weight of surveillance made her feel suspicious guilty
3243998 to deduce as much as she could about the people inside the house from the clues around her the first house had a sign on the door saying never mind the dog beware of the wife and kate made a mental note to remember that some kind of deranged person lived there
3243999 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3244000 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3244001 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3244002 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3244003 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3244004 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from taxes and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3244005 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3244006 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3244007 life is like a snowball the really important thing is finding wet snow and a really long hill
3244008 the snowball how warren buffett collected friends wisdom and wealth
3244009 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3244010 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3244011 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3244012 our guide told us a war had started not far away we could not believe it
3244013 our georgian friends told us in no uncertain terms to leave as soon as possible
3244014 we had a four hour drive back to tbilisi you could sense danger in the air
3244015 we saw georgian soldiers in army trucks giving clenched fist salutes heading out of town
3244016 it crossed my mind that the russians could easily advance to where we were
3244017 there was no option but to arrange a taxi and head for the armenian capital of yerevan nearly 200 miles away we have to stay for four days before we can fly out
3244018 closed today we think closed tomorrow we dont know when it will be open
3244019 its entertainment thats set up by people who are high minded enough to not be racist or offensive
3244020 the whole film is based on the idea that what we actors do at some level is offensive and who we are at some level is despicable and pathetic which is the truth and not the truth but the part of it that is the truth is entertaining
3244021 by the supremacy of whiteness blackness had to by necessity be its foil be its opposite
3244022 blackface is still blackface and i think its important that we have to stop allowing ourselves to be perceived as clowns to the rest of the world
3244023 a white guy playing this black role to challenge himself the most in a way thats wrong headed and going too far to me that was the funnier idea
3244024 now i live four blocks on the other side of the parkway ive pretty much always been right here in the art museum area
3244025 stevie wonder bill withers marvin gaye i also dug the allman brothers and some other rock bands but i always leaned toward the soul side of things curtis mayfield and a lot of that 70s soul is what really resonated for me in a deep way and then some of the early 90s hip hop like a tribe called quest and the roots im kind of an amalgam of all those things
3244026 i enjoyed the performance aspect of getting in front of an audience
3244027 even though musical theater wasnt something i wanted to pursue that was where i first got the bug
3244028 i was dealing with rudimentary guitar skills what was good about that is that it connected me to focusing on the melody and the lyrics
3244029 once i finished school i set about going out to open mikes
3244030 id go to the point to the grape street pub the fire thats how i cut my teeth playing at open mikes
3244031 we hit it off we started talking about philly and he told me about all the different neighborhoods he lived in when he was starting out here
3244032 he also has a very sophisticated songwriting ability i think that hes going to be around for a long time
3244033 when i was a kid it gave me a world of trouble
3244034 but once i started doing music its such a bizarre unique name that i said im going to stick with this
3244035 its almost a strange built in marketing thing its always a conversation point ive been asked what is that did you make it up even when i tell people its my name sometimes they dont believe it but its unusual and its unique
3244036 every one of the messages in hair is equally resonant today as in 1967
3244037 is about the environmental movement its about the antiwar movement its about the gay liberation movement its about the feminist movement the black power movement
3244038 its all of these ideas that came out of a piece of history when there was huge possibility and huge potential
3244039 theyre taking concepts and much like the ziegfeld follies setting them in a revue type of situation with a narrative drawn through that isnt as clear as it would be in say oklahoma or gypsy
3244040 theres no question that americans are desperately looking for change and new ways to conduct business in this country they want a new direction they want to know that their government has not forgotten them and their lives we felt that the democratic convention was a great way to kick off the momentum for change
3244041 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3244042 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3244043 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3244044 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia
3244045 thats why we not only have to denounce this but we have to work to stop the fight
3244046 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3244047 the activity is the same as far as i am concerned
3244048 we have not yet found the future whether it will be the internet is not clear the archives of the orchestra are very much ready to be released its a question of how and when
3244049 we will be meeting with charles and talking about the future we evaluate at the end of each season and see where we are
3244050 im hoping our attendance will be strong but were in much more difficult times at this point people are making different decisions on how to spend their time
3244051 some people like to hear the names that they know
3244052 she canceled with the new york philharmonic she was really not well but she loves the philadelphia orchestra and when i ask her to come she says but i play so much
3244053 obama started negative campaigning on john mccain long before we started punching back and i think a lot of our effort is really to get back into this game try and galvanize some of the public attention back onto this race make sure everybody understands theres two people in this race not just one and i think weve been successful in doing that
3244054 it was a wonderful kind of artistic event and the twin towers provided the stage
3244055 i knew the story like many people who live in the city just as an anecdote that you collect or absorb by living here almost like a folk memory
3244056 and the fact that his life well philippe would say it wasnt at stake but everyone else knows that it was
3244057 one of the things that struck me as i made man on wire was that we were sort of re creating a new york that i wished still existed
3244058 its all caught up in the destruction of the twin towers ultimately
3244059 and in fact the new york of 1974 and the world trade center walk is a world id much rather live in i guess theres nostalgia about that which maybe is a dangerous emotion but nostalgia also has a kind of ache to it
3244060 it does bring back and evoke this city that we are in danger of losing completely
3244061 i felt that the choice of not engaging with the destruction of those buildings was essential
3244062 because everybodys going to be engaged with it anyway its the big fact the big documentary fact if you like its the defining fact perhaps
3244063 and the idea for me making the film was to get people not beyond it how could you but at least to a point where you could enjoy the towers being built and you could enjoy this sort of fantasy thats being projected onto them by this obsessed frenchman
3244064 you see the buildings really almost exclusively through his eyes in the film and that then becomes a legitimate way of bringing them back to life i think youre seeing them through someone who knew them knew their secrets and their secret noises because he spent so much time there as they were being finished as they were being built
3244065 if you told it as it was with the people involved you couldnt do any better than that
3244066 its a struggle to be a filmmaker in the u s and ive just given up on it now
3244067 its almost perverse to keep pretending im an american filmmaker

3244069 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
3244070 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
3244071 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
3244072 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
3244073 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
3244074 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
3244075 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
3244076 but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
3244077 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
3244078 its completely surreal and we are really uneasy we dont dare any more to propose any price below 100 million for these clients anything below and they throw you out and you should see how they do it
3244079 at this price tag we are beyond luxury and even reality
3244080 i attended a party where the guests had fun throwing burning 500 notes into the air while everyone split their sides laughing the domestic staff were later told to collect the ashes it was sickening
3244081 two hundred people are completely destabilising it these russian oligarchs have thrown themselves into a bidding war like onassis and niarchos
3244082 we are going to strengthen the security at scenic spots to make sure no sharp weapons can be brought into the area beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
3244083 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
3244084 i rushed out and lots of people were running into the drum tower a man had jumped and his body was lying on the stones there was lots of blood it was horrible we thought there must have been some kind of fight
3244085 we will be impressing on our athletes that when their competition finishes and they go downtown it would be wise to be branded
3244086 we really should be insisting they wear their team gear as a small precaution there is more likelihood of people security and volunteers keeping an eye out for you i certainly dont think we should go downtown in civvies
3244087 what western intelligence services are up against is more akin to detective or basic police work
3244088 a conventional old line bureaucracy more like the department of agriculture than the home of an elite spy service
3244089 likely to enhance the bureaucracy rather than produce better intelligence
3244090 the damage done to americas reputation far exceeds the value of the intelligence information gained when it comes by illegal means
3244091 the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy
3244092 the x rays we took prior to her waking showed damage in the area of her brain we were all happy that she did in fact wake up but we needed to confirm that she was ok we did more x rays and found no lingering problems the damage we documented while she was still comatose was no longer evident
3244093 that wedding must not take place tomorrow and if it does you will not exist
3244094 if instead of being the father of the groom you were the father of the bride would you have come anyhow this evening and attacked me like you just did how can you call yourself a man of principles
3244095 one of the best trial lawyers in virginia a charming robust man whose genuine decency never failed to influence a jury and whose capacity to take a witness apart and not seem like a showboat had served him well for 30 years of practice
3244096 only thing that matters in a murder case is did the fellow whos dead need to be killed and did the right s do the job
3244097 as it happened mason had no need to be concerned about gates incriminating himself he was far too narcissistic and egotistical to do or say anything that might bring him hardship he proved to have a rascals capacity to write off his crime and a gift for absolute self preservation that kept him from ever mentioning the killing no matter how drunk or high he became
3244098 in early november gates found a job as a floor supervisor at a textile plant in martinsville and he announced to denise he was cutting back to only beer and pot no more coke and hard liquor and three day binges he lost the job after six weeks in the months after the firing there were sporadic trips to church basements for aa meetings a monstrous blowout with denise that prompted her to call mason and hotheaded feuds with his mom followed by the usual fulsome apologies and vows to shape up
3244099 when i was doing phantom of the opera a cabinet fell on my head
3244100 i wrapped it up put on this beautiful scarf over it and went to the gig afterward i had a colleague take me to the e r i got 14 stitches
3244101 ive worked with a 103 fever in an orchestra pit ive worked with a popped lung if you dont work you dont earn
3244102 everybody that we know that have contacted us have told us that this is a complete debauchery and that peoples heads should roll for this
3244103 the truth will reveal itself and in the end we will have to have answers and apologies
3244104 something like this hurts everyone so our board just this is the last straw we cant allow this continue
3244105 everything is fine now time to close down this goal thanks everyone

3244112 we have a great great candidate one who is going to make a huge difference
3244113 its going to get tough over the next couple of months
3244114 people dont play by the marquis of queensbury rules in american politics we all have to fight i hope everybody is gearing up i cant tell you how excited we all should be about what is happening in america right now

3244117 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3244118 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3244119 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

3244127 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3244128 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3244129 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3244130 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3244131 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3244132 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3244133 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3244134 as much as i respect apple unslow one of their new iphone 3g television ads has me wondering how they kept a straight face when they put this on the air
3244135 unslow is about selling speed speed that isnt for sale at any price it sets the wrong expectations it leads to a disconnect between the iphone in the guys hand on tv and the iphone in your hand when they dont deliver what they demonstrate people end up disappointed
3244136 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3244137 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3244138 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3244139 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3244140 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3244141 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3244142 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3244143 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3244144 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3244145 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3244146 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3244147 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3244148 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3244149 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3244150 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3244151 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3244152 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3244153 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3244154 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3244155 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3244156 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3244157 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3244158 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3244159 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3244160 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3244161 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3244162 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3244163 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3244164 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3244165 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3244166 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3244167 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3244168 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3244169 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3244170 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3244171 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3244172 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3244173 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3244174 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3244175 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3244176 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3244177 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3244178 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3244179 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3244180 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3244181 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3244182 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3244183 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3244184 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3244185 the condos will be demolished and the land will be used for storage of plant equipment such as large pipes and spare pumps the land will also serve as a buffer between the plant and the community
3244186 we paid a little over 5 million for the site which was the fair value based upon two appraisals
3244187 someone in working in the department of citywide administrative services dropped the ball and the department of buildings should have never let those permits go through
3244188 our goal is to give away 150 book bags with at least 10 of school supplies
3244189 whatever we have we collect and give back to the community
3244190 we come together and talk about what goes on as women
3244191 the bible says to love your neighbor as yourself and thats what we do
3244192 there are more and more agencies that just do not have enough food to keep up with the demand
3244193 i have so much stuff and nowhere to put it

3244200 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3244201 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3244202 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3244203 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3244204 the site is just about at the geographic center of our membership and it has wonderful visibility
3244205 were certainly pleased that theyve chosen to locate in bloomingdale and it should be a nice facility
3244206 we would like to be the gateway into the village of bloomingdale
3244207 one of the things were trying to develop is pretrial probation services that deals with people who are in county jail awaiting trial and try to see if there are some services that could be provided to not have them sit in jail
3244208 many of the people in terms of nonviolent offenders are people who dont have money to post bond
3244209 management had a four year package for less money but through negotiations we came to that meeting point
3244210 we have some quality officers who provide a continuum of care on the front line of public safety
3244211 the georgian government wasnt right if they dont have enough force they shouldnt behave like this
3244212 we currently have enrolled 1 899 kindergarten students and thats up 57 students from sept 30 last year
3244213 and we have 27 students enrolled in half day kindergarten district wide and thats an afternoon session
3244214 last year the average size of a class in kindergarten was 22 74 students
3244215 currently as we stand right now it is 23 44 so we have gained only 3 4 of a student
3244216 when it was all said and done most of our all day kindergarten teachers are from our own buildings they are not new to 204
3244217 in fact we hired four new teachers and all the rest are people who were just excited for the opportunity and asked to be moved
3244218 we are going to have access to the curriculum and instruction and be able to go deeper and improve student learning
3244219 so we have set a lofty but attainable goal that 90 percent of our kindergartners will meet or exceed expectations on several assessments so well have a point of comparison
3244220 i am pleased that we are on course in terms of education that the kids achievements are driving the budget
3244221 this years budget shows how rising fuel costs are affecting school districts
3244222 last fiscal year we supplemented out travel budget by 582 000 to cover increasing fuel costs in this budget we have increased our request to 3 million for fuel
3244223 microsoft grants the rights to use any prior version of windows server 2008 regardless of which channel was used to acquire the license

3244235 he wasnt wearing a shirt and you could see it in his eyes he was done he had had it
3244236 i wish there was a different way we could have handled this my deepest condolences to the other family
3244237 there was nothing we could have done differently nothing we would want to do differently its just unfortunate we didnt catch up with him quickly enough to deal with that

3244242 just as you wouldnt expect to see a tobacco ad on a kids site or show there shouldnt be junk food ads there either
3244243 while there are some rules for tv there are no rules when you move online
3244244 we dont want to reduce junk food advertising to kids on tv and then find that it has just moved to another platform
3244245 with social networking marketers are getting the kids to create the ads and share them with their friends
3244246 it is incredibly sticky and it is viral regulators need to understand that
3244247 the report finds that although there is room for improvement the food and beverage industries have made significant progress
3244248 this isnt rejecting cookies outright you are just preferring not to see the ads
3244249 the reason to go to india no longer is just about cost
3244250 chief brennan has brought many innovations and implemented programs that have benefited our city
3244251 i think he has done a fantastic job in reorganizing the department

3244253 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
3244254 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
3244255 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
3244256 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
3244257 we have seen quite a few more people come through and its a lot of new people as well as our people who havent come in in a while
3244258 with gas prices or that they havent been able to go into work and with the prices of food our donations are going down because people are having to spend their own money on their own families
3244259 not every week some days we have the average we normally have but then theres other days that its been from the time we open to the time we close there are people just waiting for us to get to them
3244260 then i have to pull canned goods or dry goods from next weeks stock just to have items to fill in with
3244261 that doesnt go very far and we end up having to buy food and its not that its that expensive for us we just dont have the money to work with
3244262 if i had 2 50 to spend per family per week i would be in real good shape
3244263 we do receive a lot of support from the communities financially like the bags at kroger or randalls
3244264 theyre pre packaged bags of groceries like peanut butter dried beans and rice and things like that
3244265 people in the area are buying those bags when they go grocery shopping and we get them
3244266 i was an elementary teacher my first several years in the business and became an elementary principal and the idea of returning to an elementary type setting was very appealing to me
3244267 i think god puts you where youre supposed to be and the door opened to come to damon and i stepped through
3244268 he was superintendent and principal in more schools than hes been a superintendent and thats what weve got here is a superintendent and principal so hes going to fit right in
3244269 when i went to chester they had a negative fund balance
3244270 fortunately enrollment went up in chester and leaving chester this year im leaving there with a half million dollars in the bank
3244271 what i know of him i think hes going to be very good for damon
3244272 my primary goal as a school administrator i believe your calling card is your accountability rating and i think if you can get a rating of recognized or exemplary on the taks it appeals to people
3244273 i think you have to spend a lot of time with the teachers and the students and the parents
3244274 were all designed to be learners its just that it takes different things to motivate each of us
3244275 hes got the experience and we feel like hes going to lead us to where were going to be recognized and eventually get exemplary
3244276 we feel really good about mr rhodes and feel like hes going to do us a good job
3244277 its my opinion that mr mangum has significant religious preoccupation and delusional beliefs
3244278 its complicated to know exactly what to do with bizarre religious beliefs as opposed to other bizarre beliefs
3244279 i listened at length to prophecy that i didnt understand
3244280 his words didnt really go together his thoughts didnt really go together im assuming that it all made sense to him because it fit in the lines of his delusion
3244281 he believed he was justified through god for his actions
3244282 he believed he was anointed and appointed by god to rid the world of harvested sin
3244283 i found out who i am i am the holy spirit i am jesus christ
3244284 he had an epiphany that he was a prophet or a divine being
3244285 when he got out of prison that was one of his commands from god
3244286 he knew that was an area no one would be
3244287 he sacrificed the body to god as a flesh offering
3244288 with delusional people its like looking at reality through a different lens
3244289 there was no indication that mr mangum was faking a mental illness
3244290 in my opinion he was malingering some of the symptoms that we talked about
3244291 he denied and then explained what was happening with him so i didnt take that to be hallucinations
3244292 michael phelps won his third gold medal and record tying ninth of his career tuesday breaking his own world record in the 200 meter freestyle at the beijing olympics
3244293 its cool to bring something to life whether its a song or a video but to do it and have it embraced by millions like lost thats insane
3244294 i worked hardest to bring the tech and content communities together it is happening
3244295 i got the chance to put washington and silicon valley together we are seeing an apollo project of a new kind of politics being built right now
3244296 your principles mean more to you than any money or success
3244297 he played a big part in putting it all together
3244298 the cash we get to police our various areas across the country is provided by government is provided by people through council tax and the provision of that is to provide a policing service to those areas and to those communities
3244299 if we have to take officers away from them to police football we are not able to recover the cost of that that means our normal police budget is being used for that purpose which means we then have to provide a lesser service to the rest of the community
3244300 it is very difficult i mean it is quite clear the officers at the ground outside the ground or in areas controlled by the club that is fairly obvious and thats what we currently charge for
3244301 officers who are paraded for duty that day specifically do football duties so for instance if we are bringing large numbers of officers on to do patrols in city centres and town centres then just for the duration of the football game thats quite clear
3244302 but officers who may be doing their normal duties around those areas then that would be far more difficult perhaps we shouldnt be charging for that
3244303 the law is quite clear clubs pay for any policing inside the ground and on immediately adjacent property under their control on matchday
3244304 any other provision deemed necessary is covered by the state its what people pay their taxes for with the premier league alone contributing more than 700m a year to the treasury let alone the tax take from the 13 million fans who attend premier league games during the course of a season
3244305 this long established principle applies to all individuals and organisations in the uk from private individuals to shopping centres pubs and major events like the notting hill carnival
3244306 they have invested heavily in all seater stadia cctv and stewarding as a result the numbers of police required to ensure public safety and therefore the cost has reduced over the past 15 years
3244307 we are always happy to discuss how it might be possible to further reduce costs or indeed how football can help the police tackle youth crime but we fail to see why football fans should pay twice for policing

3244313 the then principal mistakenly filled the examination forms with the wrong code and this is why problem has cropped up the whole batch was registered as disabled from the class x batch there were two drop outs thus there were 179 students who took the class xii exam from the school this academic year
3244314 it is hard to believe that this was a mistake the school was given enough chances the gshseb had sent a reminder to check whether all the information in the forms is correct or not the second time was when the marksheets of the students were received and the third time when they filled up the form for class xii
3244315 after defusing the first bomb patel got over confident and went about defusing bombs as calls poured in it was a huge risk
3244316 after defusing the first bomb i called up my senior officer sv chaudhary and described in detail the constitution of the bomb we consulted over the phone and then decided that the bombs would not pose any danger that is why i defused the other bombs without taking many precautions because that would delay the whole process and cause public tension
3244317 we have got some names of outfits from the exercise and this will help us zero in on the local help provided to the terror planners in planting the explosives
3244318 officials did not ask me about the cycle bombs or material they asked me instead about the sect i follow and who else is with us where do we offer namaaz and the new organizations that have come up in last few years we insisted that there are no such radical organizations at work in the city however they persisted for some time and then let us go
3244319 in gujarat the radical sect is not that active overtly we do not know much about the underground activities we have given the officials what they wanted there are some new organizations that opened shop in the city but i am not the right person to comment on that
3244320 we are moving in the right direction and are also getting some vital clues
3244321 we are equally intrigued about the weird spots chosen to plant the bomb but the answer to this major question being asked by everyone will surface after we get some vital clues and arrest some people who were actually involved in the act
3244322 we screened the calls but nothing substantial came out the calls made after the recovery of bombs led us nowhere as many turned out to be hoaxes
3244323 its a huge compliment to be asked to do that and it was really amazing to be taken seriously
3244324 i didnt even really respond to the rumors because they were so silly
3244325 it was someone who knew how important the line is to me and knew that that would hurt me
3244326 its so funny that the smallest thing i do can jack up everyones day lol sorry i ruined your little gossip world today people or did i give you something else interesting to cling to for your boring worlds stay tuned i might go shave my eyebrows tomorrow lets see what other fun things i can think of um dont you have a life to live i know i do peace love always brooke

3244331 our results show that the protective effect of time spent outdoors persists even if a child is doing a lot of near work such as reading and studying

3244441 i know youre fiercely independent and its been hard for you to accept this period in your life but you have to start looking at it a different way
3244442 many people you know would look at taking you out to dinner putting you up in their homes and treating you to things as an opportunity to spend time with you which they enjoy its not a burden they look at doing this for you the same way you look at doing this for them

3244500 oh i wouldnt care if she was mother bloody teresa darling it doesnt matter for our purposes what we need is a princess with a press following and a designer dress on her back
3244501 were researching her now to see if she has some kind of resurrection powers maybe shes a vampire cat with nine lives or something
3244502 emotional outburst is key to the evolution of the grieving process
3244503 last time i was on tour sean was in jail i guess its my turn
3244504 oh i wouldnt care if she was mother bloody teresa darling it doesnt matter for our purposes what we need is a princess with a press following and a designer dress on her back
3244505 were researching her now to see if she has some kind of resurrection powers maybe shes a vampire cat with nine lives or something
3244506 emotional outburst is key to the evolution of the grieving process
3244507 last time i was on tour sean was in jail i guess its my turn
3244508 fonds der gro en banken weisen nicht selten einen hohen anteil von konzerneigenen zielfonds auf
3244509 nur unabh ngige verm gensverwalter haben die freiheit frei von konzernzw ngen zu entscheiden
3244510 entsprechend unserer defensiven grundausrichtung zielen wir vor allem auf den erhalt des verm gens ab
3244511 zusammen mit rentenfonds macht diese position immer mindestens 65 prozent des portfolios aus
3244512 wir haben wegen des hohen lpreises im juni einige lwerte aufgenommen und den fonds insgesamt etwas offensiver aufgestellt
3244513 weil ich nicht immer nur beraten wollte sondern auch entscheiden
3244514 because the pilot groups of northwest and delta were willing to make an affirmative decision we will have a joint contract that becomes effective on the date of corporate closing
3244515 a seniority list process that provides a method to achieve a fair and equitable list
3244516 we believe that the best seniority list solution is one that is resolved through negotiations by pilots working with pilots
3244517 while we have confidence in the arbitration process we will remain open to a negotiated solution of a fair and equitable single seniority list
3244518 the tourism is over and now im going to do what i came here to do
3244519 im ready to go im just focusing on what weve gone over the last couple of months
3244520 a lot of times it takes him time to get into a match
3244521 we want him to be able to win that first period by being able to wrestle while being fresh
3244522 hes got great cardiovascular conditioning hes very intense and he keeps coming after you and he tires a lot of his opponents out
3244523 but that first match is crucial one match and you could be done
3244524 its not important to him he doesnt know any of them and they dont know him
3244525 that will be an advantage at first until they see him once or twice
3244526 i think he brings a great energy to the nucleus of our team weve got some veterans and he brings some very unique energy and excitement to our team i think all the veterans love the kid
3244527 if the united states and europe dont stop russia i think this is the end of what we thought of as the post soviet era
3244528 the russians feel they have been treated like dirt by the world for the last 20 years now theyre back
3244529 not exactly the greatest hand of cards to have to play
3244530 the combination is that the overall means with which weve dealt with the russians over the last two years have painted them into a corner so that its difficult for them not to see us as hostile
3244531 our goal is to get everything done in the morning
3244532 for the first night well probably tell them to give themselves an additional hour just to be safe
3244533 it upsets me that we live right there and cant walk around a place we normally feel safe
3244534 we want a neighborhood that is as crime free as we can possibly make it
3244535 the problem is we can do all this work but it only takes one or two of these incidents to make us all feel
3244536 we all grew up in this part of town walked around the lake hundreds of times and this was too much for us to bear
3244537 last year we knocked on the door this year we want to knock it down
3244538 every group is a new experience a new sense of excitement
3244539 it is a labor of love no doubt about it our coaches dont even ask what they are making all they know is that they come to work and they get some kind of paycheck every couple of weeks they love being here they love seeing the kids succeed and they are willing to do anything to see that happen
3244540 its great to see jennifer back but she wont be able to demonstrate skills and drills like she used to
3244541 on day one i am scared to death when you are able to step away and coach the other levels it gives you a different perspective i think i will be a better coach because of it
3244542 a guy like greg can be a one time deal
3244543 this was the best start weve had to two a days since ive been here
3244544 as the economy turns another corner here that could spell trouble for the region
3244545 but i think what this shows is that poverty is not an intractable problem at least in the context of a decent economy low income families can live in somewhat better neighborhoods
3244546 what we are showing in the analysis is that the concentrated working poverty rate is related to the overall economic performance
3244547 i suspect it has more to do with people earning more money than they did in 1999 because of the improved economic standards
3244548 i think this community doesnt recognize the depth and breadth of poverty that exists here
3244549 the commission is also asking whether it should recommend regulations for licensees to offer a particular form of indirect access or access to their telecommunications facilities and in what form
3244550 the church has no business in supporting a particular political party the methodist church refused to participate in the charter process which actually was a process of dialogue and negotiation
3244551 the churchs contribution would have been appropriate had the mission for social justice been central in the churchs existence
3244552 reverend manasa lasaro openly supported the 1987 and 2000 coup he should not be allowed to lead the methodist church administration again and there are many enlightened methodists who would be against a repeat of his destructive leadership
3244553 if we get in a line we can go anywhere
3244554 a russian military that seeks to reassert itself not only in the former soviet union but also to extend its reach throughout what used to be the former soviet union in an attempt to fold back into the russian empire those countries that have broken away from it most notably georgia
3244555 you cant continue this kind of consolidation of power and not expect to be isolated at least to some degree in the world
3244556 it seems much more likely to us that this change reflected worsened economic circumstances for existing residents of that community
3244557 this tastes as good as what you buy in a store
3244558 we left beech island on june 30 and our first stop was hershey park pa a side trip to yankee stadium on july 6 to see the yankees red sox was amazing yanks pulled it off in the 10th inning we have also traveled to six flags in new england uncasville ct freeport and kennebunkport maine and today we head to vermont for a week to fish golf and visit with family before we head home
3244559 it may not happen in the next seven days but probably within a week and a half
3244560 we had barely fallen below it and it only lasts about a week
3244561 it was just when the previous drought had started to recover it got as low as 315 3
3244562 right now there is very little rain in sight and if we dont get a change in the weather it is going to be setting new records later this year
3244563 just like in newfoundland fishing industry was the main industry for us and it has been like this until now
3244564 now we are looking at what we can do next because unfortunately there are not too many fish left in the waters around us we looked naturally at the oil and gas industry because it is the industry expanding and it is only beginning in the region
3244565 we dont want to wait until then to do something
3244566 the oil and gas industry is happening right here right now and we need to get our local companies involved in that industry we need to get our workforce trained and it takes several years and some times up to 8 10 years to get really qualified workers with all the certifications and experience that we will need
3244567 this is our third one and we are finding that we are always building
3244568 our geographic market in terms of interest and investors or businesses is europe so this is wonderful to see
3244569 you can see the momentum is building and the timing is right to continue to have a symposium and bring together all the players on what we are calling the next new frontier in terms of oil and gas in western newfoundland
3244570 its been a really positive week and its good timing too because this is a revitalization year for dunfield park
3244571 there are a lot of positive changes happening and we are encouraged by the turnout
3244572 when dunfield park was first built it was built for large families and after about 15 years or so it carried a reputation of having a cycle of negativity
3244573 a lot has happened in the last 40 years this is the only community centre in corner brook we also have a youth centre open now with the implementation of expanded programs and services i think well have less issues coming out of the cluster of subsidized housing communities around the city because a lot of the kids from those other areas come to dunfield park because they can access the facilities and the education programs offered here
3244574 every one of these kids here today are now aware that if they come to homework haven and our education program starting in the school year well put them in any sport they want thanks to partners like the canadian tire jump start program and other programs like that
3244575 a lot happens behind the scenes just by getting these kids out for a fun day or getting them up to the centre and having a positive influence on them from there
3244576 people want to live there so its something we should look at
3244577 the town wants around 500 in water sewer and 500 business tax
3244578 theyre just phasing that in i think its two something this year but its too much
3244579 the b amp bs are presently being looked at in the way they are assessed
3244580 there are changes being made at the provincial level which the town may or may not accept
3244581 i guess the people come here and they cant get in and pile the garbage outside
3244582 then it doesnt take much on a day like today
3244583 it illegal dumping has been an issue weve been trying to deal with for quite some time
3244584 the dump is open five and a half days a week half of monday and also tuesday through saturday
3244585 everything comes down to the public its whether or not theyre going to take responsibility for their actions
3244586 the provincial government are the ones imposing the dec 31 deadline
3244587 right now i really dont know whats going to happen
3244588 he was a good guy he was a big gamecock
3244589 i know he was really looking forward to this season i guess now hell have a better vantage point
3244590 we needed the gamecocks in the border bash to have that rivalry
3244591 randy was real instrumental in getting game cock fans to come to border bash
3244592 the border bash cannot exist without the two schools and their fans coming together
3244593 border bash meant a lot to him because he knew what we were doing benefited a lot of childrens charities
3244594 hopefully we can get up on stage and recognize randy in some sort of way
3244595 as a kid i always loved to play pretend and act like somebody i wasnt so when i learned about the drama program at my school i was thrilled to audition for some of the plays
3244596 it was a farce of the legend of robin hood so i got to pay a clumsy robin hood which i really enjoyed
3244597 its exhilarating to perform in front of a crowd i dont really notice the audience at first but i know theyre out there and i try my best to make an outstanding performance
3244598 i think to help students get better grades the teachers need to do more one on one work with students because it lets them communicate on a personal level
3244599 i think itd be more fun to go to classes where we do more hands on activities and the teachers could talk in ways that teens understand better
3244600 i love getting a new group of students that have enthusiasm to learn about the economy
3244601 i love to teach economics because i can relate it to anything and its a big part of life
3244602 id rather have my students looking up the stock market prices on the internet so that they dont get bored
3244603 i like to think of my classroom as a place where students can expect structure and flexibility within that structure
3244604 i was contacted by them and a few other teams and leagues but augusta seemed to be the perfect fit for me
3244605 ive talked to a lot of people around the league and ive heard nothing but good things
3244606 i consider myself a bigger player i like playing it out in the corners and scoring goals
3244607 i pride myself in penalty killing and if i get a chance on a power play ill take that too
3244608 matts the kind of hard nosed gritty tireless player that every team needs in the lineup
3244609 hes been heavily recruited this off season and im thrilled hes decided to come to augusta my promise to the fans when i was hired was to bring a hard working team that competes every night and matt can help lay that foundation
3244610 you have to know how much you want to spend and when to stop they really have great stuff
3244611 if you think people arent spending money we sold 58 cars in an hour and 10 minutes
3244612 all were selling is estates or farmers who are going out of business
3244613 every person and businessman was going broke the interest rates were 18 to 20 percent
3244614 its always different we dont know what were going to have from one sale to the next
3244615 the rule of thumb is the bigger the demand for an item the more return on the retail dollar
3244616 we look to see if we can find items to buy and sell
3244617 over a period of time you can find almost anything you want here
3244618 and of course video games are a big part of my everyday life
3244619 im really optimistic and outgoing with a positive outlook on life
3244620 i would like more teens in our community to interact with each other than just people you go to school with
3244621 i work too much and i always have a camera with me
3244622 i come off as a simple guy but behind that i enjoy writing poetry and reading philosophy
3244623 i have really enjoyed the teen board in the past two years and hope to make this year a great one
3244624 in augusta its very black and white and you dont see a whole lot of other people
3244625 i want to be able to influence at least one person
3244626 oh mommy thank you for sitting with me thank you for this special treat
3244627 tonight more on edwards and the fallout from his admission today about a sexual affair is this another skeleton in the democratic closet that barack obama must struggle to overcome
3244628 now questions about his edwards future abound in the party and whether this creates another shadow over barack obama as he gets ready for the conventions
3244629 obviously all options as to sentencing will be kept open
3244630 if the dollar continues to rebound well see even more of a drop off in commodities including crude
3244631 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
3244632 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
3244633 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
3244634 the most disappointing thing the most incredible thing is that nobody caught it
3244635 an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3244636 no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3244637 i came out of the film feeling like i had been assaulted
3244638 my relationship with the church of god has been broadened and deepened
3244639 i dont know if my church loves me any more or not
3244640 this whole business of an opennesss to the spirit of god is just not properly british and as such im quite comfortable with the idea of maintaining my own withdrawn reserve as at least equally spiritual
3244641 if you like you can eat alone in your room
3244642 the staff wants you to eat and drink on your own but if you wont well have to tube feed you
3244643 you cant expect to get better if you dont eat and drink
3244644 are there any changes in your bowel or bladder habits
3244645 tonight hollywood is mourning the loss of an acting legend
3244646 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
3244647 and could i mention that sen obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it but i also dont think that thats a way to become energy independent
3244648 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3244649 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3244650 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3244651 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3244652 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3244653 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3244654 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3244655 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3244656 im not running for anything but my highest and best uses is trying to be a good governor and trying to help sen obama in virginia which as you know traditionally hasnt gotten a lot of attention in presidential years
3244657 i really believe for the first time in 44 years that we have a great chance of getting the electoral votes in a blue column for senator obama this fall
3244658 to kill kidnap and cause bodily harm upon a major candidate for president of the united states that is senator barack obama
3244659 of course obamas supporters got him his usual birthday gift of gold frankincense and myrrh
3244660 today the moderators were announced for the upcoming presidential debates good yeah apparently barack obama insisted on someone who asks even handed probing questions while john mccain insisted on someone who will talk into his good ear
3244661 john mccain does not want dick cheney to attend the republican convention because he says hes too unpopular yeah and when asked to comment cheney said i hope the senator reconsiders then he turned into a bat and flew away
3244662 senator barack obama had a birthday yesterday hes 47 years old which means that senator barack obama and john mccain have a combined age of 147 years
3244663 hey by the way president bush is on a trip to asia ladies and gentlemen he will be spending the entire week in the orient usually bush is in the disorient
3244664 the tide has finally turned the polls in the presidential race are tied in that barack obama is winning by slightly less people are finally seeing this guy for what he is a slick hope salesman getting by on platitudes like his timetable for troop withdrawal in iraq and his 15 point health care plan its all so vague
3244665 barack obama has agreed to debate john mccain three times this fall both candidates have conditions obama wants the debates to be held on college campuses mccain wants them to be held before 7 00 p m
3244666 congress went on a five week vacation starting today and boy they deserve it dont they they got so much done this year solved the energy crisis health care social security immigration whew take a break fellows
3244667 oh you hear about this here you go paris hiltons mother is very upset because john mccain has put paris in his campaign video you know about this he put paris in his campaign video and shes furious isnt that amazing of all the videos paris hilton has been in this is the one moms upset about
3244668 no she said his ad featuring paris is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention just like paris basically
3244669 el asunto del vih es asunto de lo que se siente en mi coraz n lo que se siente en mis huesos
3244670 it was a must win game because of the circumstances
3244671 but i need something a pill a syrup maybe something intravenous to wake them up to remind them how much fun their skin is their mouths strong and adventurous and that theyre all so very very young
3244672 contributed to the circumstances that gave rise to the injury
3244673 the evidence that we have shows that your excessive consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor in the incident
3244674 although i cannot comment on the individual decisions of the criminal injuries compensation authority i can be clear that it is not our policy to reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption
3244675 this stance supports our view that a victim of rape is not in any way culpable due to alcohol consumption it is never an individuals fault if he she gets raped regardless of how much he she has drunk

3244680 post godhra riot case 7 get lifer the city sessions court on friday convicted seven people in a post godhra riot case and sentenced them to life term for the murder of 35 year old mukesh panchal a resident of lambha he was attacked by the accused and went missing on november 7 2003 from shah e alam darwaza his mutilated body was found near chandoka lake on november 11 one of the seven accused javed shaukat ali meanwhile managed to give the cops a slip and fled from the court

3244682 a sting operation on chief minister narendra modis involvement in a spate of fake encounter killings
3244683 the modern day neros were looking elsewhere when best bakery and innocent children and helpless women were burning
3244684 the chief minister modi frantically asked for the army units to be called in
3244685 unlike february 28 when one community was entirely at the receiving end the minority backlash on 1 st march has further worsened the situation and the army staged a flag march in ahemedabad on 1 st march 2002 at 9 00 a m
3244686 modi did not call the army until three days had passed
3244687 this is exactly what we had said no action was taken by modi on 29 th 30th and 31st thus giving three clear days to the murderers
3244688 you are to be my life mate to be mine forever

3244694 rusia ha invadido un estado vecino soberano y amenaza a un gobierno democr ticamente elegido por sus ciudadanos una acci n as es inaceptable en el siglo xxi
3244695 m s all de que en algunos momentos se haya producido alg n exceso verbal
3244696 las palabras deben servir para aportar soluciones y no para exacerbar pasiones mal entendidas
3244697 especialidad de la casa de madrid del gobierno del estado y de las fuerzas pol ticas espa olas
3244698 arrecia el cruce de acusaciones entre el gobierno y el psc
3244699 qu est pasando con la financiaci n auton mica con la que est generando una crisis muy importante
3244700 en pleno acusa a zapatero por el bloqueo de la financiaci n catalana
3244701 busca llevar al congreso la bronca de la financiaci n
3244702 pausado y por etapas pero sin perder de vista el objetivo final la independencia
3244703 el empate infinito siempre perjudica al m s d bil que en este caso somos nosotros
3244704 la progresi n de la discordia entre el gobierno y los barones socialistas por un lado y el tripartito catal n por otro demuestra que la inserci n del sistema de financiaci n previsto en el estatuto de catalu a y pactado por zapatero con los nacionalistas de ciu no tiene encaje en el estado auton mico dise ado por la constituci n
3244705 la relaci n bilateral entre la generalitat y el estado y la singularidad del sistema estatutario de financiaci n son piedras de discordia que amenazan la estabilidad del estado auton mico y est n afiladas por la crisis econ mica y las necesidades electorales de cada bar n socialista
3244706 el sudoku de la financiaci n no tiene soluci n y se ha convertido en un sudoku pol tico para lo socialistas cuyo origen no es la actitud reivindicativa de montilla sino las decisiones de rodr guez zapatero de alternar con el nuevo estatuto el estado auton mico
3244707 montilla tiene raz n cuando reclama a zapatero que cumpla su palabra aunque hacerlo sea un perjuicio para los intereses nacionales
3244708 pondr a al ejecutivo ante un escenario con pocas opciones a una crisis de gobierno el deterioro imparable de su cr dito o la convocatoria anticipada de elecciones
3244709 no s lo no firm un alto el fuego sino que rusia increment ayer su ofensiva militar en territorio georgiano lo que constituye una inaceptable violaci n del derecho internacional y de la integridad de un estado soberano
3244710 mosc ha disipado cualquier duda sobre su intenci n de aprovechar el estallido b lico en osetia del sur para reafirmar su tutela sobre el c ucaso
3244711 ya que la sola perspectiva de que se reproduzca en el c ucaso un escenario similar al balc nico resulta aterrador
3244712 claro que los aliados no est n dispuestos a pasar por alto este ataque a la soberan a georgiana
3244713 es imprescindible hacerle entender por todos los medios a rusia que no puede jugar con el rompecabezas cauc sico a su antojo pero est por ver si la ue ser capaz de fijar una estrategia com n y de necesaria firmeza
3244714 pero todo parece peor hoy que antes de la consulta porque el enfrentamiento con los poderes regionales augura un grave rumbo de colisi n
3244715 la batalla entre el centralismo e indigenismo fundamentalistas de la presidencia y la descentralizaci n extrema de la oposici n se libra sobre todo en las provincias
3244716 es un enfrentamiento que refuerza el hecho de que morales haya perdido en esos territorios
3244717 el indigenismo excluyente y racista no es una soluci n como tampoco la atomizaci n del pa s andino el siglo xxi ha de ser igual para todos
3244718 la batalla de los referendos revocatorios celebrados en bolivia no la han ganado ni evo morales ni los gobernadores opositores la han perdido los bolivianos llevados entre todos a un disparadero lejos de aclarar la situaci n las votaciones del pasado domingo s lo han servido para complicarla a n m s el pa s ha profundizado en sus divisiones nada ha cambiado y si lo ha hecho ha sido para peor
3244719 por desgracia no es posible vislumbrar un futuro despejado para bolivia sino m s bien un horizonte lleno de nubarrones
3244720 el referendo revocatorio celebrado el domingo en bolivia ha tenido la rara virtud de oscurecer el equilibrio de las instituciones m s si cabe que antes de que fuera convocado
3244721 entra a enormes dificultades para cualquier eventual negociaci n que plantee el presidente para salir del atolladero de la rebeli n de las provincias relativamente pr speras

3244743 purpose of israeli nuclear weapons not often stated but obvious is their use on the united states
3244744 it is dangerous in the extreme that in the cauldron of animosities that we call the middle east one nation has armed itself ostensibly with stockpiles of nuclear weapons perhaps numbering in the hundreds and that inspires other nations to do so
3244745 could have an impact on us for the next 100 years

3244766 conservative christian leader james dobson has softened his stance against republican presidential hopeful john mccain saying he could reverse his position and endorse the arizona senator despite serious misgivings
3244767 he must consider mccains record against abortion rights and support for smaller government and added mccain seems to understand the muslim threat he also indicated mccains choice of a running mate will be a factor
3244768 of his new position dobson said in the statement to the ap if that is a flip flop then so be it
3244769 he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good
3244770 seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness
3244771 if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul
3244772 fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell
3244773 be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect
3244774 i have not yet seen any slow down in business which could be attributed to the slow down in the us real estate market although one might predict several possible long term effects this correction that we are experiencing is greatly needed to put some sort of normality in the appreciation investors builders and owners need to realize that patience at a time like this is very important and this region is going nowhere and is still one of the most beautiful and highly for real estate in the world first many factors influence the local real estate market including that of the as mentioned in the question above overall the median price of a home in missouri is 89 900 okay so how will a now confirmed u s slowdown affect the real estate market here in the lovely riviera maya real estate note listings allow you to easily sell a part of the note or the whole thing this does not go without certain consequences following when most investors are priced out of the market it is possible that our investor clients will find our property in yucatan an even more attractive option as the market here continues strong with good appreciation for many sellers the investment is more than worthwhile they never do a weaker market means less demand for new homes and therefore less homebuilding this is a time to relax and reevaluate the up and

3244780 i believe music and my guitar is the meaning of life itself nothing generates so much joy in to peoples lives
3244781 i think courage honour and passion is the meaning of life and i have tried to make my music an example of that during my lifetime
3244782 bounced and rolled just under 300 feet landing in a ditch
3244783 now that i have a newborn daughter so much was going through my head
3244784 it was decided even before last years general election that we needed a broader based leadership
3244785 sinn f in needs to develop their southern leadership and they are doing that by putting people like young councillor tomas sharkey a teacher from louth forward people like him are being given more responsibilities within the organisation adams would like to be in a position to take a back seat but he cant as the broad new leadership base needs to be developed
3244786 there was never the slightest chance of that happening you cant talk about the presidency until you have a solid base in the south
3244787 unfortunately from a republican perspective there are two different jurisdictions and two different economies and two different realities on the island
3244788 it is clearly important that we should have capable and effective leaders and spokespeople in the south and in the six counties
3244789 the general view among my generation is that we would like people like gerry adams and pat doherty to remain on as the wisdom and experience they have from negotiations is priceless
3244790 whenever adams doherty and mitchel mclaughlin came through as leaders in the 1980s they were all in their 30s the existing leadership in the 1980s resisted them taking over yet those men are welcoming new ideas and people now
3244791 there are a lot of creative and talented people being given a free voice in the party and a lot of young councillors and members were at the forefront in the lisbon campaign
3244792 it is too early to get into speculation about the next leader the view within the party is that the new generation can rely on the experience of people like gerry adams and pat doherty which will be crucial in times ahead
3244793 the question of who might take over after adams is looming very much in the not too distant future in fairness to adams the leadership is a very stressful job and he probably needs to retire soon
3244794 if you are looking at sinn f ins leadership the big question is the division between north and south there has been a major momentum towards examining the leadership after the outcome of last years general election
3244795 adams was not au fait with the southern situation during that tv debate and it was telling that during the lisbon campaign that adamss face did not appear on posters mary lous face did appear on the posters in dublin and while she performed well in referendum debates she remains problematic and she is not the darling of the grassroots the republican constituency in dublin are not entirely happy with her compared with more traditional republicans
3244796 the prevailing view is pointing towards conor murphy as adamss successor he is personable and has a good record as a minister he is competent and clean cut he is also from south armagh he was in the ira and he has done his time which is still seen as important among northern republicans
3244797 if you look at mitchll mclaughlin you can see that this is true
3244798 there is nobody coming forward as a possible leadership candidate from belfast and this could pose problems for sinn f in one of the problems with the sdlp was the domination of derry for their leadership there will be no heave against adams he is still the man in the party when the dup were presenting difficulties in june it was adams that stood up to them and said we will call a halt to the stormont executive there has not been an executive meeting since then
3244799 there is no question of who is the leader gerry adams is president has been our president and will be our president into the future he is 100 respected
3244800 pattern of work by certain officers within special branch designed to ensure that informant 1 haddock and his associates were protected from the law
3244801 the evidence clearly shows that informant 1s behaviour including alleged murder was not challenged by special branch and the activities of those who sought to bring him to justice were blocked repeatedly
3244802 informant 1 would have been well aware of the level of protection which he was afforded
3244803 i have to praise chief constable sir hugh orde and assistant chief constable peter sheridan
3244804 they said theyd ensure a proper investigation of what the mount vernon uvf were allowed to get away with and thats what theyve done
3244805 im confident that more arrests will follow im confident that the protestant and catholic families who suffered at the hands of this gang will finally get justice

3244817 this may be the first time a physical signature for a personality disorder has been identified
3244818 for the first time to my knowledge we have a specific brain association for people with a personality disorder
3244819 its new and different because its not a lesion or injury to the brain but it is a difference in perceiving information that comes from an interaction
3244820 its not just a matter of bad attitudes or a lack of will
3244821 we have great strength in the area of personality disorders through our relationship with the menninger clinic

3244828 the support so far this season from the region has been fantastic but this is without doubt the biggest game of the year for the club and players
3244829 the last meeting between the two teams was a fiery and physical battle and both sides will be keen to get the win on saturday
3244830 i know that the team is fired up for this weekends game and with a huge crowd behind us on saturday it will certainly lift the players against the jets
3244831 even though we have qualified in the top three for the finals there is still a lot riding on the match and it is a must win game if we want a chance to host a home final in cairns
3244832 i know that everyone is talking about it at the moment and it would be great to get a home final it is a massive game for us and a large parochial home crowd would be fantastic
3244833 we know what we are here to talk about my lords and we may as well put pretense aside and begin
3244834 very well then let us proceed we have witnessed a wonderful thing as to that we are necessarily agreed as to the value of it if it has any that is a matter which does not personally concern us we can have as many opinions about it as we like and that is our limit we have no vote i think space was well enough just as it was and useful too cold and dark a restful place now and then after a season of the overdelicate climate and trying splendors of heaven but these are details of no considerable moment the new feature the immense feature is what gentlemen
3244835 the invention and introduction of automatic unsupervised self regulating law for the government of those myriads of whirling and racing suns and worlds
3244836 you perceive that it is a stupendous idea nothing approaching it has been evolved from the master intellect before law automatic law exact and unvarying law requiring no watching no correcting no readjusting while the eternities endure he said those countless vast bodies would plunge through the wastes of space ages and ages at unimaginable speed around stupendous orbits yet never collide and never lengthen nor shorten their orbital periods by so much as the hundredth part of a second in two thousand years that is the new miracle and the greatest of all automatic law and he gave it a name the law of nature and said natural law is the law of god interchangeable names for one and the same thing
3244837 and he said he would establish natural law the law of god throughout his dominions and its authority should be supreme and inviolable
3244838 he said he would by and by create animals and place them likewise under the authority of that law
3244839 i heard him but did not understand what is animals gabriel
3244840 ah how should i know how should any of us know it is a new word
3244841 my lords he is making animals will it please you to come and see
3244842 they are an experiment in morals and conduct observe them and be instructed
3244843 the tiger yes the law of his nature is ferocity the law of his nature is the law of god he cannot disobey it
3244844 then in obeying it he commits no offense divine one
3244845 this other creature here is timid divine one and suffers death without resisting
3244846 the rabbit yes he is without courage it is the law of his nature the law of god he must obey it
3244847 then he cannot honorably be required to go counter to his nature and resist divine one
3244848 no no creature can be honorably required to go counter to the law of his nature the law of god
3244849 the spider kills the fly and eats it the bird kills the spider and eats it the wildcat kills the goose the well they all kill each other it is murder all along the line here are countless multitudes of creatures and they all kill kill kill they are all murderers and they are not to blame divine one
3244850 they are not to blame it is the law of their nature and always the law of nature is the law of god now observe behold a new creature and the masterpiece
3244851 put into each individual in differing shades and degrees all the various moral qualities in mass that have been distributed a single distinguishing characteristic at a time among the nonspeaking animal world courage cowardice ferocity gentleness fairness justice cunning treachery magnanimity cruelty malice malignity lust mercy pity purity selfishness sweetness honor love hate baseness nobility loyalty falsity veracity untruthfulness each human being shall have all of these in him and they will constitute his nature in some there will be high and fine characteristics which will submerge the evil ones and those will be called good men in others the evil characteristics will have dominion and those will be called bad men observe behold they vanish
3244852 a small globe i made a time two times and a half ago you saw it but did not notice it in the explosion of worlds and suns that sprayed from my hand man is an experiment the other animals are another experiment time will show whether they were worth the trouble the exhibition is over you may take your leave my lords

3244859 this weeks meal is a chicken thigh roasted with garam masala potatoes onions and pole beans pan fried with cumin and coriander eggplant garlic and grape tomatoes cooked in garam masala and cumin and corn on the cob with lime butter and chili powder tomatoes and pole beans are from my garden and all other meats and veggies and garlic are from local farmers
3244860 we also had a wide variety of summer squash and sweet corn from our csa that are not pictured most unfortunately as it made for a very colorful meal i grilled the veggies wrapped in foil with some olive oil and salt i got the blueberries and cherries from the local farmers market origin michigan
3244861 this weeks local meal was a simple one allowing us to eat in front of the tube for the olympics we had blts with all ingredients including the buns local the carrots and broccoli all were from our own garden if youve never had fresh from the garden broccoli you must give it a try its tender and kind of spicy delicious if you havent figure this out yet i always save room for dessert this week is was a mixed berry pie blueberries raspberries and blackberries from our fruit csa
3244862 sausages from thurns frozen cabbage that i braised potatoes from hw organics and double smoked bacon from thurns
3244863 consisted of a fried egg mushrooms and potatoes everything in the potato dish was from the garden potatoes a disappointing yield from the first two plants which had decided to die but the potatoes i did get are good onions jalapeno and green pepper all cooked up in my cast iron skillet as were the mushrooms i also fried the egg in the same pan and finally thought to used an oiled english muffin ring to keep the egg contained until i flipped it
3244864 we have opened a criminal investigation and are investigating it thoroughly
3244865 how many pounds of tnt can a cessna carry how many pounds of nitroglycerine can a model plane carry

3244867 they both unloaded on me and i started seeing stars and the whole thing was just bam bam bam after that
3244868 someone had a chokehold and they were all on top of me and i couldnt breathe and i thought i was going to die

3244878 i think in the next few months we will further see a slowdown in inflation
3244879 producer price figures showed costs pressures remained quite big while consumer price figures showed price rises on the consumption side have eased
3244880 what is especially encouraging is that the price hike on oil products prices in june did not change the declining trend of the inflation
3244881 household purchasing power is declining mainly due to rising consumer prices
3244882 exports the driver of above trend growth in the past three quarters have turned lower and external demand may make a negative contribution to growth
3244883 the economy does appear to have entered a cyclical downswing reflecting the sharp deterioration in the terms of trade and slowing global demand
3244884 the economy has eliminated excesses built up in the aftermath of the late 1980s bubble and the fundamentals of the economy are much better than in the previous post bubble cycles
3244885 the chinese are too strong and the only opportunity for us is to wait for them to make a mistake
3244886 i am confident of bringing back two gold medals at the games
3244887 i will work hard on every dive instead of caring too much about results
3244888 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal
3244889 i was out in open water and i was in the middle which makes it difficult for the other guys to see me
3244890 i hope it will do as much for olympic sports as ours in 1983 did for cricket
3244891 the economic damage is regrettable for a country that has worked hard in recent years to improve the economic well being of its population
3244892 foreign investors who have played a key role in the countrys good performance could be scared off
3244893 its confidence in the countrys strong economic fundamentals at this extremely critical time for georgia
3244894 strong economic fundamentals including ample foreign reserves prudent monetary and fiscal policy and wide ranging financial sector reforms that has lead to a strengthened banking sector that today is both liquid and solvent
3244895 higher arms spending than planned can also endanger the governments budgetary consolidation objectives

3244897 inspirational sometimes all of us forget that love for movies that internal spark inside us that movies lit and overstreets book is going to remind many of us about it
3244898 i admit that cycling does have a problem and we have to deal with that
3244899 we are catching cheats but thats mainly because we are looking for them
3244900 the uci has been one of the leading international federations in the fight against doping which is not the case of some bigger federations
3244901 weve been doing blood tests on the riders for years in comparison fifa the international football federation only began doing blood tests last year
3244902 i think weightlifting understands as cycling understands that there is a huge risk for both those sports if the cheating is continued and continued to be exposed
3244903 i will be hoping to talk with the wada chief while i am here and im sure well have plenty to discuss
3244904 the uci is comparatively small compared to athletics and football but we are at the forefront of the doping fight we have pioneered the biological passport scheme which is costing five million euros to launch and which is going forward
3244905 first of all its not the wada chiefs decision whether we stay in the olympics or not
3244906 and i dont believe you should punish a sport because it is finding cheats
3244907 he rogge has stated publicly in the past that he supports us
3244908 we have had nothing but support from the ioc even from the ioc medical commission who understand what we are trying to do

3244918 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3244919 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several us diplomats it is a real shame
3244920 let it be a un mandated international force ideally eu
3244921 we are working with an international community but all we got so far are just words statements moral support humanitarian aid
3244922 but we need more we want them to stop this barbaric aggressor
3244923 this appears to be a full invasion of georgia with an end result uncertain and an objective that is not clear but appears to be aggressive in nature
3244924 words like invasion should not be used lightly but this is an invasion
3244925 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3244926 phishing pharming virus attacks and hacking of systems belonging to companies is no longer done for fun or curiosity but is now big business as there is money to made from such invasions
3244927 at the same time the public and companies both often lose large sums of money as a result of fraud committed by people who are difficult to trace
3244928 we now need to make sure that they can offer protection for all types of invasions
3244929 we have to make sure law enforcement has the necessary skill set
3244930 a resolution to the energy crisis is going to take some bold moves

3244936 it doesnt matter where they are at in illinois they have got to eliminate natural water from their boats

3244938 it gives them a tremendous area of responsibility to enforce rules and regulations including the new vhs regulations
3244939 it may have an impact not only on the bigger fish the commercial fish like the chinook salmon but also on the forage fish
3244940 its not going to wipe them out but it certainly could do some damage to the lakes fishery
3244941 theres really nothing you can do once its in there is no vaccine theres no treatment its basically watch your fish die it all comes down to prevention

3244944 global demand for u s coal should stay strong for at least 2 3 years everything we hear suggests that coal will continue to be strong at least in the mid term horizon
3244945 the problems were encountering are on the supply side the mining companies can barely keep up with demand
3244946 demand for export coal has significantly increased as global supplies tighten
3244947 it appears as though were at or near bottom its difficult to pick that point but there does appear to be some improvement going forward at this point

3245029 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3245030 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida

3245040 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3245041 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3245042 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3245043 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3245044 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos

3245048 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3245049 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3245050 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3245051 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

3245064 tomorrow the new record releases its just a really amazing time in our lives
3245065 were so excited were going to go to virgin megastore across the street and wait in line a little bit longer
3245066 we do anything for our fans and we owe everything we have to them
3245067 we cant tell what were performing but it will be our second single
3245068 for the last three or four summers weve been going over to europe and doing all the festivals and it looks like we just totally ignored our fans in america but thats not the case as a consequence the american fans miss us and they want their metallica so this will be a good homecoming for them and us
3245069 we were talking to lars and he goes were going to take you guys on tour
3245070 i want this to end when im on top so im planning my final show on december 21 2012 its when the mayan calendar ends its the day when solids become liquids and liquids become plasmas
3245071 so im building up to that weve got four years so maybe theres going to be a couple other small releases in the works the album just came out so i have no plans for another release but im constantly starting to work on new stuff just for the live shows
3245072 i used to play very short sets and now i kinda play a standard 45 minute to one hour set so i think i wanna do a 24 hour set and i want it to be a stage production but one where the lines become blurry between reality and complete stage me i want it to be an endurance test and i want it to be miserable and equally fantastic i want the best of both worlds
3245073 i think in too many shows people are too aimed at pleasing the audience if you want to do a really great show which i havent fully done yet you have to really make it bad for them for like 20 hours and then you can kill it for four hours and everyone will be really excited i think people ignore the dynamics of how you can work with an audience
3245074 there are very few people driving to this festival its a huge mass transit event and i think that alone must save a tremendous amount of fuel and help from an emissions standpoint
3245075 i think its great how transportation by ferry is being so encouraged
3245076 and they made it really hard to get parking passes so that keeps it green
3245077 the line was so long i was like what is this
3245078 that takes a lot of extra effort and extra money but the artists were very conscious about not throwing stuff away
3245079 were not adding tons of plastic and paper plates backstage but its a small thing and theres probably a ways to go there
3245080 my girlfriend drives a hybrid and i quit turning my lights on when i go to the restroom
3245081 these artists are out there not to beat people over the head but to increase awareness of a lot of different issues
3245082 in a pretty easy way it creates a little consciousness about what happens when you throw it away
3245083 lets pick it all up lets get a little reward for doing so and it will also keep the grounds looking a lot nicer for everyone throughout the weekend
3245084 for us to accomplish that mission we needed to shed a lot of extra baggage
3245085 we needed to focus a little more we needed to make quicker decisions we needed to be ok saying no to certain stuff and we needed to weed through stuff quicker
3245086 one of the coolest things was rick actually suggested that we all stand up and rock out like we would live
3245087 and we did and it put a lot of life into the basic tracking of it all it was almost to the point where when i was retracking stuff i was standing up headbanging id never done that in a recording situation before hes a great song doctor and he has great ears
3245088 the great thing about working with rick is hes never around
3245089 i would say thats a very strong point in that it leaves the four of us to take on the entire brunt of the work and the planning that goes into the songwriting process and the recording process
3245090 bob would add a lot of his own musical input and with that came a lot of his own influences and style and jurisdiction and idiosyncrasies
3245091 and it would eventually make it into our sound but with rick because he wasnt there its almost 100 percent undiluted metallica hed come in and say thats good that isnt change that and we would have to figure that out for ourselves this is the most pure weve sounded in a long time
3245092 rick is not the kind of producer like a bob rock whos there every moment holding your hand making you step up
3245093 rock arranged everything all the time and wore many hats in the studio rick rubin no hat rick comes in and goes well wheres the songs ok thats good thats not so good more of this less of that see you in a few months goodbye and thats what we needed that brutal honesty to get through it and it worked
3245094 the slipknot that he did the system of a down records he did and even the johnny cash stuff where its the essence of him and you hear him you hear whats going on thats what i want i want people to really hear metallica
3245095 so in a way its got somewhat of an older sound songs and arrangement wise weve got a lot more diversity on the record instrumentals fast shorter songs epic ballady moments its quite different from st anger where if youre angry this is your album and if youre not it might take some work
3245096 the lord of the rings the return of the king
3245097 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at his wife rhonda
3245098 she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3245099 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3245100 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3245101 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3245102 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3245103 he represented a kind of hood attitude and cultural phenomenon that was under exploited in america but had great potential
3245104 he was always honest and that honesty was what he exuded and what made him so great
3245105 its a terrible loss i mean you need funny in your life at all times he was definitely one who brought it one of the best comedians ive ever really experienced and condolences go out to everyone in his family
3245106 bernie is just ridiculous with it or he was so god bless his family god bless his soul but bernie was that dude for real so rest in peace man
3245107 the most disappointing thing the most incredible thing is that nobody caught it
3245108 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3245109 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3245110 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3245111 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3245112 the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscars
3245113 movies about the mentally retarded is something we talked about for a long time my grandfather was adopted by a mentally retarded man a man who shouldnt have been allowed to adopt a kid
3245114 when he saw forrest gump you never saw a guy angrier than him it was not such a picnic to be raised by that guy
3245115 the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future
3245116 however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3245117 i lost my mama i went through so much drama i went through so much drama im for obama
3245118 its not a black or white thing its not a rap or rock and roll thing
3245119 its a good music thing we jam about good things from the heart how can you pick between me and trent reznor
3245120 i hope you had a good time f that the time of your life
3245121 it seemed so weird last time we spoke you admitted to a lifelong fear of condiments i dont want to get you upset
3245122 not like the writers and producers at motown or quincy jones but he was on that level in my opinion
3245123 he gave me my voice he taught me showed me and nurtured my voice he didnt teach me how to sing he taught me how to be a better singer that was isaac
3245124 he didnt have a choreographer he didnt have a show
3245125 isaac would just get up there and sit down and become one with the song he was doing and you would look out and the women would be hanging on every word it made me wish my voice was that deep
3245126 i met isaac hayes when i was on the road with james brown in the 70s
3245127 we played a few festivals together in my later years i got to know the man behind the music he was the first official black man to be known as a real rapper and he had nothing but praise for his queens and women of the world
3245128 hayes was so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best
3245129 although he was under the weather he was still performing
3245130 he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls
3245131 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure
3245132 isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator
3245133 i tried to be as real as i possibly could
3245134 and i keyed in on the character shaft the character himself
3245135 i think the songs out there today when the kids talk about romance i think theyre too blatant they dont leave enough for the imagination
3245136 i like to use metaphors thats right and take it slow and easy and then build its kind of like foreplay you dont want to get there too soon else its all over its like eating candy just gobbling it down and then i want some more and its gone you have to savor it
3245137 warped tour was great but we cant wait to get back into venues that actually have roofs over our heads and arent 110 degrees
3245138 touring with the roots was something weve wanted to do for a while and were real excited its finally happening and estelle opening things up its over tour of the year fans are in store for a real special treat who knows whats gonna happen out there
3245139 excessive credit growth is attracted to the hottest sectors of an economy

3245160 there was a feeling by some in the aviation community that thered been a degree of capture of the regulator by the major operators qantas
3245161 it is not good enough for the regulator to respond after the event one would hope that they had been applying the same level of scrutiny or something approaching it in the lead up to these events
3245162 automatically terminated owing to the preconditions for implementing the agreement had not been satisfied by the deadline
3245163 whether to renew the agreement or not and when to renew the agreement is only a technical issue

3245166 despite its good fundamentals finnair has been unable to insulate itself from sector developments indeed the second quarter was clearly weaker than the previous year
3245167 faas claim that it can use its property management authority to auction slots is intellectually dishonest and a disturbing end run around congress
3245168 this administration believes it can ignore the statutory limits of its authority to remake the industry as it sees fit
3245169 should be held unlawful and set aside because these actions are in excess of the faas statutory authority constitute unauthorized regulatory action and are arbitrary capricious an abuse of discretion and otherwise not in accordance with law
3245170 market based mechanisms are the best way to assure consumers will receive quality service at affordable prices
3245171 indeed such measures have been very successful at managing congestion in other transportation modes and can provide strong incentives for more efficient use of a strained resource like new york area airports
3245172 i was such a new mother i didnt have anything to say
3245173 we have also run amok with the whole sexualization of breast and the nurturing side of breasts is just not something that is very visible

3245175 to have a store like that in naperville support you is really incredible
3245176 i took a class in college and that inspired a passion for it
3245177 the amazing thing about living across the street from wrigley is whether theyre good or bad the ballpark is still filled
3245178 there are so many people who come day after day
3245179 but the overall theme of every cub fan is the hope the belief and the anticipation
3245180 one was that the entire layout and design is all my own
3245181 we were really able to portray what i wanted to show
3245182 we are cubs fans an unofficial journal of baseballs best fans
3245183 this will give people a chance to see how elgin is changing for the better
3245184 each theater will have its own venue to present their work

3245192 while patricia only worked at renz center for 6 years
3245193 she had a tremendous impact on drug and alcohol prevention in our community she was instrumental in securing a 1 000 000 substance abuse and mental health service administration grant for hiv aids outreach spearheaded the anti drug mural campaign with local companies sponsoring one of the six panels representing an alternative to drugs developed alcohol tobacco and other drug education prevention workshops for high school students and worked closely with the elgin gang and drug task force
3245194 im single i pay for a basic major medical plan on my own but have zero dental zero eye insurance
3245195 i pay 100 a month right now if i wanted to add maternity and female coverage that cost would quadruple
3245196 weve had four employees withdraw from the plan in the last year because they cant afford it
3245197 many of our friends who make more than us dont have health insurance people think that nothings going to happen to them but thats just not the case
3245198 you have this image of who the insured are and its just wrong
3245199 we cannot implement the pay raises without an appropriation but more importantly i am of the opinion that this is no time for pay raises
3245200 i think thats just a way to distract us from the real issue
3245201 cessation of hostilities and the complete withdrawal of russian and georgian forces
3245202 the bombs that are falling on us they have an inscription on them this is for nato this is for the u s
3245203 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3245204 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3245205 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3245206 one of the things were trying to develop is pretrial probation services that deals with people who are in county jail awaiting trial and try to see if there are some services that could be provided to not have them sit in jail
3245207 many of the people in terms of nonviolent offenders are people who dont have money to post bond
3245208 management had a four year package for less money but through negotiations we came to that meeting point
3245209 we have some quality officers who provide a continuum of care on the front line of public safety
3245210 women age 25 to 35 for obama who wear flip flops in starbucks
3245211 if youre not one of us youre one of them
3245212 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
3245213 as far as i know we dont publish response and refusal rates we conducted the poll for the associated press youd have to ask them about releasing the response and refusal rates
3245214 we dont have them here from ipsos it takes a little while for them to get those to us i can ask them it shouldnt take too long but normally it takes a few days theyre not secret or anything
3245215 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
3245216 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
3245217 im not opposed to green things as long as they yield results but if its a feel good thing im opposed
3245218 part of the scope is to come up with specific projects project costs and pay back
3245219 we dont want to replace something and say oh we could have saved 50 000 this year
3245220 we want to make sure were doing the best we can to save money
3245221 in some cases weve reduced it the achievement gap by half
3245222 its a nice gesture but he could probably help a lot more people by looking at the tax increases that are being talked about
3245223 it was their democratic caucus that put that pay increase in place
3245224 it seems like something very handy to bring up now
3245225 putting it back the way it was for 100 years definitely will help
3245226 i think ive counted six people in a day using the bike lane tops no one uses the thing
3245227 its always difficult when its the first project in a plan
3245228 sometimes the owner of a building and the business operator are two different people
3245229 with anything that is brand new there are opportunities to step back and reflect as to what could and should be modified this clearly is an example of such reflection
3245230 we have opened a criminal investigation and are investigating it thoroughly
3245231 if youre an existing business and people are going to build houses around you and complain the noise ive got a problem with that
3245232 if they were there first and people move around them knowing its a business i have a problem telling them what time they can do deliveries you can work with them talk to them but to force them to do it i have a problem with that
3245233 if its causing a problem for the residents then its causing a problem for the residents
3245234 i am pleased that we are on course in terms of education that the kids achievements are driving the budget
3245235 this years budget shows how rising fuel costs are affecting school districts
3245236 last fiscal year we supplemented out travel budget by 582 000 to cover increasing fuel costs in this budget we have increased our request to 3 million for fuel
3245237 that should just be part of every boaters routine when they bring their boat out of the water
3245238 as long as fishermen are using common sense practices washing their hands thoroughly cooking their fish before they eat there should be no problem for humans
3245239 it doesnt matter where they are at in illinois they have got to eliminate natural water from their boats
3245240 our conservation police officers will check the public boat ramps when they are out for their safety checks
3245241 it gives them a tremendous area of responsibility to enforce rules and regulations including the new vhs regulations
3245242 it may have an impact not only on the bigger fish the commercial fish like the chinook salmon but also on the forage fish
3245243 its not going to wipe them out but it certainly could do some damage to the lakes fishery
3245244 theres really nothing you can do once its in there is no vaccine theres no treatment its basically watch your fish die it all comes down to prevention
3245245 the site is just about at the geographic center of our membership and it has wonderful visibility
3245246 were certainly pleased that theyve chosen to locate in bloomingdale and it should be a nice facility
3245247 we would like to be the gateway into the village of bloomingdale
3245248 we want to do it with renewable energy because after the initial payback with installation theres no cost
3245249 all these schools are saying this would really help us in controlling our costs since the state has been somewhat irresponsible in funding us at 31 percent
3245250 we currently have enrolled 1 899 kindergarten students and thats up 57 students from sept 30 last year
3245251 and we have 27 students enrolled in half day kindergarten district wide and thats an afternoon session
3245252 last year the average size of a class in kindergarten was 22 74 students
3245253 currently as we stand right now it is 23 44 so we have gained only 3 4 of a student
3245254 when it was all said and done most of our all day kindergarten teachers are from our own buildings they are not new to 204
3245255 in fact we hired four new teachers and all the rest are people who were just excited for the opportunity and asked to be moved
3245256 we are going to have access to the curriculum and instruction and be able to go deeper and improve student learning
3245257 so we have set a lofty but attainable goal that 90 percent of our kindergartners will meet or exceed expectations on several assessments so well have a point of comparison
3245258 most reports on the exxon numbers ignore the combined contributions to the joint mccain rnc fundraising apparatus
3245259 together the mccain rnc team raised much much more than the obama dnc team both from exxon specifically and the three companies cpr highlighted mccain and the rnc raised 56 361 from exxon employees compared to 42 808 on our side mccain and the rnc raised 204 461 from exxon chevron bp employees compared to just 94 221 for the obama dnc team
3245260 overall mccains campaign has gotten three times more money from the industry than obamas has 1 3 million compared to about 394 000

3245265 especially at this time when were in a down market we need to be that much more aggressive

3245267 and hopefully developers would invest more than they would otherwise

3245270 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
3245271 hes a world record holder in all these events so he is dominating the events just like i did he reminds me of myself
3245272 we heard a few noises a few were false alarms when we found it it was pretty much under the net
3245273 i was watching michael phelps after the anchor leg touched
3245274 the whole thing is genuine thats the good thing about the olympics
3245275 its unusual for one of the navys capital ships to go it alone
3245276 under this strategy the time hori zon for redeployment would be negotiated with the iraqi government and nested within a more assertive approach to regional diplomacy the united states would make clear that iraq and america share a common interest in achieving sustainable stability in iraq and that the united states is willing to help support the iraqi gov ernment and build its security and governance capacity over the long term but only so long as iraqis continue to make meaningful political progress
3245277 preventing them from acquiring heavy weapons tightly restricting their jurisdictions and movement and closely monitoring them for compliance so that they do not rub up against rival militias
3245278 iraqis of all sectarian and ethnic groups believe that the u s military invasion is the primary root of the violent differences among them and see the departure of occupying forces as the key to national reconciliation
3245279 you can only measure a negative refractive index by measuring the phase velocity
3245280 in 1994 when at last we had turned the bank around after five years of struggle and three years of intensive research we received the bombshell i did not expect from of all people our parent company the cws i was informed we were up for sale
3245281 as a banker i knew that any company at this point in its history having been turned around from losses to profits better than had ever previously been achieved was at its most vulnerable
3245282 the decision had already been made and the asking price was 110m the successful sale of the bank especially at the ridiculous price they had said had been agreed with the cws would have been an easy task
3245283 later with my chairman i agreed the following course of action the first objective was to try to ensure the bank was not sold at any price the second objective was to merge or be sold to a co operative bank
3245284 eventually we were down to one serious potential buyer dg bank of germany
3245285 the battle had now changed from the cws executive trying to sell the bank to the whole of cws and its subsidiaries being subject to a takeover bid
3245286 having our own teams gives us more flexibility to allocate our resources where they need to be
3245287 its an additional layer of security that also acts as a deterrent
3245288 you need dogs with drive stamina and a good nose
3245289 the safety belt for pregnant women moves the safety belts diagonal strap away from the bump which means it is much less likely to cause damage to the foetus
3245290 id decided to come up with some new products and my wife said why not think of something for pregnant women
3245291 that was christmas 2003 it took until 2004 to develop the idea and until 2005 to set up the company now in 2008 weve finally got the patent
3245292 we have already tested it with the bolton aerospace and automotive research group but we still have another round of testing which could cost as much as 80 000 to comply with the uk safety regulations
3245293 weve not yet got a manufacturer lined up so now we have to decide whether to manufacture it ourselves or to team up with someone else
3245294 if we do it ourselves that could mean another 80 000 worth of investment
3245295 ive always been inventing just most of the time i was doing it for someone else its exciting and always has been
3245296 i want america to know that this is a really really stressful time for the russian and georgian community
3245297 right now if people arent acting normal its because theyre worried
3245298 my dad had to pretend to be having a good time but my dad kept talking about russia and georgia
3245299 we are worried whats happening and russia and georgia right now
3245300 this is too little too late and our investigation into morgan stanley continues
3245301 never have we witnessed defendants who created a product that isnt inherently illegal being required to buy back such a large market
3245302 domestic institutions reported having tightened their lending standards and terms on all major loan categories over the previous three months
3245303 it reinforces the view that the economy will be weak in the next several months and there will be renewed pressure on the fed to start easing again
3245304 when the fed started to cut rates mortgage rates and other rates were actually lower than they are today
3245305 to say that things are easier in many areas of credit would be mistaken
3245306 when times are tough the herd starts running in the other direction with tougher standards pretty much across the board
3245307 large majorities of domestic respondents reported having tightened their lending standards on prime non traditional and subprime residential mortgages over the previous three months
3245308 it was pretty much a jaw dropping response from entertainment people around the world
3245309 everyone was amazed by how it turned out by the scale of it and the quality of it
3245310 we were one of the few companies that made a profit out of it
3245311 its a commodity type of business and its something that everyone needs
3245312 when businesses look for these services they are becoming more price sensitive especially here in new york and in new jersey smaller and midsized tax advisory businesses can more easily sell into a market that demands a better price
3245313 were not a cpa firm but many of us here are cpas
3245314 were the closest thing to a corporate tax department firms dont want to add too many people to their in house departments but its hard to deal with the ebb and flow they prefer to be lean and mean today thats where we come in
3245315 i had 20 plus years at a large fortune 500 firm and so i am used to dealing with tax managers because i was one of them
3245316 at that point you tend to get treated like an employee

3245325 tripoli agreement of 1976 it sought to establish an autonomous government for muslims in south of the philippines under its sovereignty and territorial integrity but pres marcos grossly violated the letter and spirit of the agreement
3245326 any solution less than full independence of the bangsamoro people will not work past experiences since the beginning of the annexation of the bangsamoro homeland to the philippines in 1935 have proven that the bangsamoro muslims could not live a normal life under a corrupt and secular government and that the two nations the bangsamoros and the filipinos could not get along with each other because of their distinct religions customs and traditions it will be for the best interests of the bangsamoros and the filipinos if both are free

3245328 that is why muslim theorists have called the islamic state
3245329 but what is surprising is despite of the long period of war being fought for the bangsamoro people are still engaged in a war for freedom and independence
3245330 we wish to be then friends of all nations but they must understand that we cannot tolerate any abuse on the contrary we will repay with death the least thing that touches our honor
3245331 it is necessary to clarify contrary to popular perception two important points in history firstly the first group of people whom the spaniards in 1570 called
3245332 preachers of the doctrine of mahomet since it is evil and false and that of the christianity alone is good
3245333 you shall tell him that our object is that he be converted to christianity and that he must allow us freely to preach the law of the christians and the natives must be allowed to go and hear the preaching and to be converted without receiving any harm from the chiefs
3245334 where that accursed doctrine has been preached and you shall order that it be not be rebuilt
3245335 as he was instructed to meet force with force and to punish the moros as he deemed best
3245336 the moros fought for home and country for freedom to pursue their religion and way of life and for liberty to rove the seas whichever they would
3245337 never during the entire continental expansion of the united states had armed encounters been as frequent and serious as that between the moros and american troops
3245338 the u s colonial government and the succeeding filipino neo colonial power have utterly failed to stamp out moro resistance but they have succeeded in rendering the moro traditional power structure effete and almost obsolete
3245339 the main casualties were the sultans and datus whose authority had been squelched to the extent that they had become mere symbols of the past and mute relics of history
3245340 has been almost severed and to get rid of the evils of dual rule meaning sultan and government ruling simultaneously the commonwealth government directed all state installed officials in 1936 to take over the roles so far exercised by the sultans and datus
3245341 any solution less than full independence of the bangsamoro people will not work past experiences since the be ginning of the annexation of the bangsamoro homeland to the philippines in 1935 have proven that the bangsamoro muslims could not live a normal life under a corrupt and secular government and that the two nations the bangsamoros and the filipinos could not get along with each other because of their distinct religions customs and traditions it will be for the best interests of the bangsamoros and the filipinos if both are free

3245353 ive been a fan of the movie since it came out
3245354 i guess it coincided with the beginning of my band the runaways so i remember going to see it many times in hollywood when i lived there
3245355 a lot of people still come up to me and say they really loved the show
3245356 i started out acting in school in stage plays so to be able to actually make it to a broadway stage i was just happy to do it if people saw it thats great but it was a real learning experience i learned things then that i still use now
3245357 i think its going to be really interesting to see what theyre going to do with it they have very big shoes to fill getting the right cast seeing how they work with the material then theres the campiness of the original and the fact that it was somewhat low budget
3245358 there are just so many intangible qualities involved but all these elements combined the first time to make it magic
3245359 its not just horror movies being remade every tv show has been done and re done its nice to see updates on movies that have already been made but id like to see some originality too
3245360 there are so many great actors out there it would be great to see some broadway actors in the movie version
3245361 other people have fashion lines and perfume but i have a guitar

3245363 we told the community well do the best we can to minimize the impact of the lob and we think we did that
3245364 in looking into this we have had interest income that was unanticipated and i think we can accomplish what we want in this agenda by reducing the capital outlay
3245365 in the last couple of years weve worked really hard to spread our projects out to keep costs down
3245366 under the new system a gymnasts total score includes values for both the routines content and his her execution basically the new scoring procedure adds the difficulty score which includes difficulty connection value and element requirements to the execution score which encompasses execution artistry composition and technique to determine a gymnasts total score scores no longer have a maximum value of 10 difficulty score difficulty and technical content the difficulty score represents what was previously known as the start value and includes difficulty and credit for connections two high level skills that are connected and element group requirements which are the basic categories of skills elements that must be included in a routine the element group requirements vary by apparatus this score is determined by the a panel which is a two person panel the difficulty value is determined by totaling values for the 10 most difficult skills which includes the dismount each skill has a set difficulty value as outlined in the code of points and for the women are divided into seven classifications with six for the men the difficulty value of a skill or element is not recognized if it fails to meet its technical requirements also credit is also only given once for a skill connection value is awarded when specific skills or skill types are executed successfully in succession the women can earn connection values for the balance beam uneven bars and floor exercise while the men can earn it for the floor exercise still rings and horizontal bar for men and women each connection value is either 0 1 or 0 2 points element group requirements are the basic skills or elements that must be included in each routine and vary by apparatus this area is similar to the special requirements in the past if all of the requirements are included a maximum of 2 5 points is awarded each judge on the a panel independently reaches his her difficulty score and then the two compare and reach a consensus
3245367 execution score execution artistry composition and technique the execution score determined by a six person b panel now begins at 10 and deductions are made for errors and faults in technique execution and artistry composition each judge independently determines his her score the highest and lowest scores are dropped and the gymnasts execution score is the average of the remaining four judges scores deductions for neutral errors are subracted from the sum of the difficulty and execution scores the deductions for various errors have changed and now range from 0 1 point for a small error to 0 8 point for a fall neutral errors include those for stepping out of bounds or violating time requirements as well as attire or podium violations

3245378 the people of kuwait are impressed with the independence of the judiciary and trust in general its rulings
3245379 in other arab gulf nations you dont see a court sentencing in this way a member of a ruling family
3245380 there is no immunity for members of the ruling family just for the reason that they are part of this family
3245381 deserves the death sentence for dealing with drugs and narcotics that threaten the security of society and lead its youth into the mire of addiction
3245382 rulers of these states fear the space of democracy in kuwait might at the end affect their power
3245383 for them the kuwaiti phenomenon is like a plague that needs to be contained

3245399 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
3245400 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies

3245405 this place has fallen off big time i used to love getting food from there food always came promptly and the delivery drivers were always very

3245407 good art is good for everybody the more art is in peoples consciousness the better it is for everybody this is a good opportunity to bring more art to this area and so far weve had a wonderfully welcoming response from livingston manor
3245408 ok you idiot fans if kiss has an opener on the bill dont you think they are probably fans of the band and or obviously had a say in who was going to be opening such a historic tour
3245409 madia on the run wont stand up for working americans
3245410 the legislation is called the employee free choice act and i am sad to say it runs counter to ideals that were once at the core of the labor movement instead of providing a voice for the unheard efca risks silencing those who would speak
3245411 to my friends supporting efca i say this we cannot be a party that strips working americans of the right to a secret ballot election
3245412 i worry that there has been too little discussion about efcas true ramifications and i think much of the congressional support is based on a desire to give our friends among union leaders what they want but part of being a good steward of democracy means telling our friends no when they press for a course that in the long run may weaken labor and disrupt a tried and trusted method for conducting honest elections
3245413 not surprisingly madia received significant support from organized labor unions and their affiliated political action committees have contributed nearly 170 000 to his campaign so far or more than 10 percent of the total raised through june
3245414 the hard working people of minnesota deserve a representative in congress who will have the courage to make tough decisions and not run away from the issues like ashwin madia is doing
3245415 if madia wont stand up and face the voters now it is obvious that they cant count on him to stand up for their needs over special interests in washington
3245416 when the project was conceptualized it was conceptualized with a subsidy
3245417 you cant do any of this stuff without a subsidy none of it makes sense
3245418 there was a commitment when steve leeper was the sports amp exhibition authority director that there would be no additional taxpayer money used in the development between the stadiums somebody has decided to change that rule thats not surprising given everything thats happened in the past year on this land
3245419 given that they were able to purchase the land at one fifteenth of its value at some point we have to question why all the benefits are being given to one developer for one piece of land
3245420 right now the land is sitting there it is generating zero revenue except parking revenue for the sports amp exhibition authority the steelers will buy the land at a value determined six years ago they will put up an entertainment facility that will pay sales tax back to the state liquor taxes back to the state real estate taxes back to the city county and school district and income taxes back to the city and the state
3245421 the sum total of that will be an excellent return back to the state
3245422 we didnt pitch well enough from the beginning plain and simple
3245423 we threw too many pitches we had too many walks and too many hit batters
3245424 we got up early came back late we all just battled and got it done
3245425 the prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide and this epidemic is accompanied by a high incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease
3245426 in conclusion we provide evidence that a metabolically benign obesity can be identified and that it may protect from insulin resistance and atherosclerosis
3245427 furthermore our data suggest that ectopic misplaced fat accumulation in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity
3245428 among u s adults 20 years and older 23 5 percent approximately 16 3 million adults of normal weight adults were metabolically abnormal whereas 51 3 percent approximately 35 9 million adults of overweight adults and 31 7 percent approximately 19 5 million adults of obese adults were metabolically healthy
3245429 these data show that a considerable proportion of overweight and obese u s adults are metabolically healthy whereas a considerable proportion of normal weight adults express a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities
3245430 further studies into the behavioral hormonal or biochemical and genetic mechanisms underlying these differential metabolic responses to body size are needed and will likely further the identification of possible obesity intervention targets and improve cardiovascular disease screening tools
3245431 both reports emphasize the benign nature of fat accumulation outside the abdomen
3245432 in both studies the detrimental effect of visceral fat accumulation and its surrogate waist circumference were clearly demonstrated confirming older studies showing that waist circumference is a risk factor even in normal weight individuals

3245448 people have come to realise that making their own skincare products can be easy jojoba oil by itself is a great makeup remover toner is easiest with aloe vera and a few distillates which you can mix and match according to skincare type or time of day or even adjust your moods masque is a mix of clay and water hydrosol scrub can be your cleanser plus exfoliants and lip balm is a mix of beeswax with oil
3245449 its also a hassle to calculate the percentages when say something in the powder form has to be dissolved in water and for facial products i would rather err on the side of caution and measure more accurately

3245468 india has the worth of 360 million market for mobile television service

3245471 take you through the journey assessing your environment and looking for opportunities to decrease costs and increase utilization rates
3245472 its a commonly held belief that because youre virtualizing all your problems go away
3245473 but you still have software change management issues you still have one thousand operating systems you have to patch whether theyre on hardware or virtual machines you still need good change management principles and tools and you cant buy virtualization thinking its going to solve all your problems
3245474 typically organizations have approached virtualization in an ad hoc manner
3245475 they want quick cost benefits and dont strategically structure their approach to virtualization as part of their overall asset portfolio encompassing the physical system so they dont get the benefit of planning
3245476 from end to end in the context of physical planning
3245477 looking at virtualization as part of the overall it portfolio from the very beginning and considering how best to optimize the use of virtualization in augmenting physical systems
3245478 is not a panacea its not a one size fits all
3245479 every application will be addressed in some specific form or combination of forms of virtualization
3245480 if you need to sacrifice the internal guys so that the customers who drive your revenue are happy
3245481 sometimes when analysts at some of our larger customers realize they have 500 cpus at their command they launch enormous jobs and if they submit these at high priority and during the day a trader needs to execute a query very quickly theres going to be a problem
3245482 so you need policies in place that make sure the most important work gets the highest priority
3245483 you need to understand your application portfolio and understand how to drive the applications to meet your needs
3245484 isnt a project thats going to end in two months its the road you take and the destination is increased utilization and guaranteed service levels regardless of the unpredictable dynamics around utilization and whats happening to the world outside
3245485 you shouldnt have a three year plan you should have a rolling 3 6 month plan install this find out the bottlenecks solve those install a bit more
3245486 theres always going to be a new bottleneck somewhere and its better to install something and keep doing an incremental install
3245487 take you through the journey assessing your environment and looking for opportunities to decrease costs and increase utilization rates and that has a set of tools on the front end to take advantage of virtualization
3245488 thanks cad people for screwing us over because your so damn lazy to update your piece of junk software man it seems the only way to go about anything now is the microsoft way so microsoft wins yet again i see why no games are developed in opengl now
3245489 this is an unbelievable letdown i kind of saw it coming but i never expected the architecture review board arb to fail on such an immense scale
3245490 i find it astonishing how far some people can be removed from reality and yet not be immediately fired due to overwhelming incompetence this is the death of modern opengl thank you very much arb what microsoft never managed you did
3245491 opengl 3 0 is a significant evolutionary step that integrates new functionality to ensure that opengl is a truly state of the art graphics api while supporting a broad swathe of existing hardware
3245492 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
3245493 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves

3245500 algunos no creen en el estado sino que creen en el mercado
3245501 nosotros creemos en la injerencia del estado para regular muchas veces a mercados que son oligopolios y monop licos y que se abusan de las condiciones preponderantes que tienen en el mercado e incrementan los precios

3245515 ive always felt like we have the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett or management or whatever
3245516 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3245517 its been an interesting last month but i think our team has gotten pretty tight
3245518 the support from our teammates throughout the day today was definitely encouraging
3245519 i was just hoping i was going the right direction
3245520 i understand the attention around him his performance tonight and him playing tonight
3245521 but i saw aaron just like he is every day i thought he went out there he played with excellent energy which i always recall him playing with i think hes done a really good job being consistent and understanding that the microscope is on him
3245522 i can pretty confidently say that no other quarterback in the league has ever stepped into a situation that hes stepped into
3245523 but hes handled it tremendously he played extremely well tonight and you could tell the organization you can tell why they have confidence in him
3245524 once we got going we were sharp we were crisp we moved the ball effectively and got a couple of touchdowns
3245525 it was just good to just get that first game rust off and get some confidence on those last couple of drives and get ready for the next one
3245526 offensively we got off to a slow start but we picked up the pace as the half went on
3245527 im going to go out and have some fun like i always do every year
3245528 yall know how i am im going to have fun trust me

3245536 since assuming responsibility for marketing in february steve has led our efforts to increase effectiveness of our marketing by diversifying our tactics and more emotionally connecting with our customers

3245542 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3245579 o death where is your victory o death where is your sting
3245580 we were gentle among you like a nursing mother taking care of her own children 8 so being affectionately desirous of you we were ready to share with you not only the gospel of god but also our own selves because you had become very dear to us
3245581 behold i tell you a mystery we shall not all sleep that is die but we shall all be changed
3245582 in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet

3245588 he himself bore our sins in his body on the tree

3245592 for god has not destined us for wrath but to obtain salvation through our lord jesus christ who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we might live with him
3245593 you have put more joy in my heart than they have when their grain and wine abound in peace i will both lie down and sleep for you alone o lord make me dwell in safety

3245979 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a significant and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3245980 these actions would be inconsistent with assurance that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in south ossetia that existed before fighting began
3245981 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country
3245982 please wake up everybody and please make your position and speak with a united voice
3245983 im not going to have to worry about him because somebody else down south is going to take him out
3245984 if that man is elected president hell be shot sure as hell the hate would be so deep down south
3245985 the kkk or someone will assassinate obama if we get a n president all you n s sic will think youve won and that the white people will have to bow to you f that
3245986 people on these racist and white supremacist websites are being quite careful because they know that if they make a threat they will very likely get a visit from the secret service
3245987 the scary thing out there is the lone wolf phenomenon there are enough crazy people in this movement that it is possible one of them will decide today is the day to kick off the aryan revolution
3245988 we are looking at every possibility and making sure that we have prepared for every conceivable contingency if someone is threatening violence we will go to great lengths to deal with that
3245989 this is an accident and we expect to follow appropriate procedures under international rules
3245990 it just came out of nowhere and i was like huh
3245991 and he said it again and i was just like what and he said it again
3245992 i just wanted to know where is he getting that from and he said you take plays off in the season and i said well why dont you come and do my job and ill do your job and lets see how it works he said it again and i said yes sir all right and i walked off
3245993 theres no signs that say youve got to stay positive
3245994 i wasnt yelling and screaming and using profanity and all this at roy i was just being constructive and they boot me out i mean what in the world dont even open it
3245995 i thought he should have this because he deserves it after all his years of service to young people in the community he was appreciated a lot more than he realized in fact he asked me if i thought anyone would show up i think all these people turning out shows him how much he meant to us
3245996 im really surprised and pleased i will be 90 on thursday and right now im in good health but you never know
3245997 i went to st johns but they bussed us over to jefferson for the program the gymnasium and that wing were new in 1950 and thats where our program was
3245998 though i was born and raised on the farm i got a lot of information from him he taught us about crop farming and livestock he taught a farm shop where we built things like cages and shelving we raised livestock and every student had a project he checked them regularly and made us keep records when we held meetings he was very professional in making sure proper parliamentary procedures were used
3245999 he treated everyone alike he didnt have any favorites he expected a lot he took his job very seriously he had discipline but was easy going and he worked hard we had a lot of evening meetings i dont know how his wife ever put up with him
3246000 he also did a lot of things in the community with st johns the knights of columbus and the st vincent de paul society he was always in the background he was never one to take credit for all that he did but i knew what was going on
3246001 pick any of the flowers as many or as few as you want and arrange them in any way you want or just smell and feel and experience the garden the flowers will always re grow and they will always be fresh and there will always be variety it is yours to do with as you please you can keep it all to yourself or you can share it with the entire world because they are there for you to use or not use as you please and the flowers have always been there are now there and will always be there

3246006 we would welcome more tourists but we dont want to lie to them in the name of the mande burung
3246007 i believe 100 per cent there is something i will not say it is mande burung because we have not found it but as long as there is no proof we will keep looking
3246008 there are many stories in our myths about elves or whatever but the mande burung is not part of that folklore
3246009 the creature was on the rock he was playing with a stone hitting it against the rock it was black
3246010 it was just a few seconds that i saw it i was very scared
3246011 we are not going to give up until we find it

3246037 but things happen sometimes experience shows up and takes over im not saying they will drop but if you go by the numbers that is normally what will happen always the guy with the more experience and the guy who has been in the same spot always takes over
3246038 experience only matters in the playoffs in the regular season anything can happen
3246039 i never showed any emotion when i got asked that before they play the game right when that happens thats the way its going to be
3246040 at the beginning of the year it was aw when are they going to drop off its the tampa bay rays but now i think everyone understands theyre a great team

3246052 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3246053 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3246054 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3246055 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3246056 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3246059 in any case if christian morality brought europe to the war which is now going on then it would be as well to be as far as possible from such morality
3246060 many people say that they do not understand the moral side of your teaching
3246061 and others say that your teaching has no morality at all
3246062 people are very fond of talking about morality but morality is merely self suggestion what is necessary is conscience we do not teach morality we teach how to find conscience people are not pleased when we say this they say that we have no love simply because we do not encourage weakness and hypocrisy but on the contrary take off all masks he who desires the truth will not speak of love or of christianity because he knows how far he is from these christian teaching is for christians and christians are those who live that is who do everything according to christs precepts can they who talk of love and morality live according to christs precepts of course they cannot but there will always be talk of this kind there will always be people to whom words are more precious than anything else but this is a true sign he who speaks like this is an empty man it is not worth while wasting time on him morality and conscience are quite different things one conscience can never contradict another conscience one morality can always very easily contradict and completely deny another a man with buffers may be very moral and buffers can be very different that is two very moral men may consider each other very immoral as a rule it is almost inevitably so the more moral a man is the more immoral does he think other moral people

3246067 la uf adem s de producir un efecto multiplicador creciente produce un da o enorme en los sectores m s vulnerables del pa s que son los trabajadores con la p rdida del poder adquisitivo de tal modo que nosotros planteamos una revisi n una discusi n de esta materia porque no puede ser que los sectores empresariales protejan sus ingresos en uf y los trabajadores sigan perdiendo poder adquisitivo recibiendo sus remuneraciones en pesos
3246068 no es primera vez que esto ocurre ya que cada vez que la inflaci n se ha acelerado han surgido propuestas como estas en el 89 durante la campa a presidencial el en ese entonces candidato presidencial francisco j err zuriz ten a como uno de sus ejes de campa a eliminar la uf en cinco minutos
3246069 tambi n es el soporte de gran parte del sistema previsional privado osea todas las personas que se jubilan hoy sus pensiones est n pensadas en uf por tanto se podr a eliminar para unas cosas y otras no el problema es que si la eliminas para el tema de reajustibilidad de deuda los bancos tendr an que pasarse a otro sistema de reajustabilidad
3246070 sino la inflaci n llevamos mucho tiempo y cuando la inflaci n ha sido estable desde el 2000 en adelante a nadie le import ni molest la uf eliminarla es romper el term metro todas estas propuestas desconocen el origen del problema
3246071 si tu limitas el uso de la uf el efecto econ mico es nulo es un efecto pol tico lo que va a pasar es que en el contrato de arriendo te van a poner que te comprometes en reajustar el valor del arriendo que va a tener cuales y tales valores cada tres meses se reajustar de acuerdo a la tasa de inflaci n el gasto de la gente jam s se bajar por eliminar la uf
3246072 desde el punto de vista t cnico y econ mico la uf no es nada m s que la expresi n de un mecanismo de indexaci n para mantener reales los contratos
3246073 el tema de fondo ac es que la inflaci n es muy alta la uf es simplemente una consecuencia de la inflaci n no es una causa en si misma y va a causar un tremendo problema hay contrataos pactados en uf cr ditos de largo plazo sobretodo del mercado hipotecario concebidos hace muchos a os

3246078 generalmente las pymes nacen con una mentalidad centrada en el producto pero no tienen una infraestructura de costos que les permita competir con eficientes grandes empresas u ofertas de exportaci n de bajos precios tampoco tienen una diferenciaci n en la oferta del producto esto es una receta para un fracaso seguro

3246085 our response to the barkly climatic conditions is a prime example of the strength of aaco
3246086 our geographic spread and our strategic planning ensured that we were ready and able to move cattle to safer pastures
3246087 aacos management had the depth and breadth of skills to successfully move a considerable amount of cattle to the north east and south
3246088 its important to note that we are positioning the business to take full advantage of what we anticipate will be a rapid increase in cattle prices in the remainder of the year

3246101 china is a closed society so nbc is essentially opening doors for the other parts of ge
3246102 for those reasons the olympics are working out quite well for ge
3246103 the ratings have been generally higher than what people thought
3246104 there is certainly a core audience for the olympics but there also is a tremendous interest in china
3246105 besides that the economy is lousy gas is too expensive and people are taking fewer vacations that might make them amenable to stay home and watch something where they can root for the athletes
3246106 we expect a profit here but its still too early to tell exactly where it is going to be
3246107 just one of the many benefits of having nbc as part of the ge portfolio

3246123 everyone knows this has sort of been a breakout year for him
3246124 if theres ever a time i see this as a really good opportunity to let him pitch
3246125 luis tiant was his college pitching coach so he had a real funky delivery and he threw hard
3246126 once he became a full time knuckleballer i couldnt even play catch with him anymore
3246127 he just kept hitting me so much i had bruises everywhere
3246128 he consistently comes out and pitches like you would expect a veteran to
3246129 its not like he has a chip on his shoulder but theres a little bit of that hes been working so hard that many of us thought he should have been here already
3246130 hes fun to watch the demeanor of a knuckleballer is so laid back they just go at it slicing and dicing
3246131 its a nice break for the legs the stress of going after balls in the outfield cutting balls off in the gap its nice to get a break from that
3246132 i think i might burn out on it a little bit
3246133 it definitely is a welcome break i could see myself doing it for a week or two at a time who knows you never know how it works out but ive prided myself on my defense for so long it would be weird not to play very often
3246134 danks had been good all night keeping the ball off the outside corner really painting
3246135 he threw me a really good pitch the first pitch of the at bat i just tried to stay on it and drive the ball and it worked out going to the gap

3246137 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3246138 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3246139 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3246157 it almost felt like less pressure because it wasnt initially my event
3246158 i dont think its necessarily fair what happened but rules are rules and im just doing what im told
3246159 i just wanted to win my heat and set everything up for tomorrow
3246160 just get through that and prepare myself for tomorrow thats the most important thing an afternoon off and its time to just sort of get as rested as i can recover and i probably have to re shave get all of that stuff down

3246208 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3246252 the children who get it seem to get it every time they have a cold
3246253 but the good news is that its not actually doing them any harm its not a reflection of lung disease or asthma and ultimately kids grow out of it

3246337 yeah from ecoman family 17 november 1958 or maybe a pigeon cries in ecotropolis from the ecoman amp black ecoman special winter 1975 you could play the african american sidekick as we bust up that drug house full of nuclear waste

3246463 i feel very comfortable about what i know of the incident
3246464 it didnt warrant him being suspended from the team statements came out that were not accurate he was not drinking a lot of people took what was said and ran with it therefore there was a rush to judgment without the facts
3246465 there is no doubt in my mind that charges will be filed
3246466 people who know him cant believe the change ive seen a kid whos been a leader and works his butt off
3246467 its unfortunate hes getting the rap he gets hes not doing more than a lot of kids in college i wish everyone knew how good a guy he is

3246484 some of our guys havent had that experience and were trying to educate them that this isnt a seven game series youve got to produce and play together each time
3246485 were talking about it a lot our preparation over the last two years is to approach every game as one and done
3246486 its been a long commitment but well worth it to be a part of it
3246487 im just trying to give whatever i can to coach k hes been great in allowing all of us to have input and work together
3246488 they have gone out of their way to make sure we enjoy this experience
3246489 hes established that hes well respected by the players and hes learning the international game
3246490 we havent looked ahead much but the short answer is yes hed make a terrific candidate for the top job down the road
3246491 of all the systems of religion that ever were invented there is none more derogatory to the almighty more unedifying to man more repugnant to reason and more contradictory in itself than this thing called christianity
3246492 if we consider the nature of our condition here we must see there is no occasion for such a thing as revealed religion what is it we want to know does not the creation the universe we behold preach to us the existence of an almighty power that governs and regulates the whole and is not the evidence that this creation holds out to our senses infinitely stronger than anything we can read in a book that any impostor might make and call the word of god as for morality the knowledge of it exists in every mans conscience

3246515 we all know theres two new teams coming in next season the players ive spoken to all of them have been very positive about next season and possibly further
3246516 its moving along well most of it will be done before the season starts or a week or so in
3246517 if there are others that are uncertain theyll just see out their contracts and we either negotiate at the end of the season or whenever its appropriate
3246518 through agents that you talk to all the feedback is the players want to know what my situation is
3246519 i cant in good conscience and good faith say i want you to sign for another two years or another three years and then leave
3246520 dannys 35 but craigs still only 32 so craigs still got at least another three years left in him
3246521 i think the most important thing is that theyre happy within the club the structure weve got the setup weve got
3246522 its not just about what their pay packet is its being happy in the environment that theyre in so if thats the case which it seems that way with most of them now theres no reason why we cant keep the ones we want to keep

3246579 i am curious what are your thoughts regarding legalized polygamous marriages do they deserve the same equity that is being fought for homosexual marriage
3246580 except in cases of tangible harm to public health and welfare
3246581 and if polygamy was instituted equitably you might well see women with harems of men too
3246582 yes but a conflict can arise if the net effect of people exercising their individual rights is to place an undue burden on others i suppose it comes down to what you think societys obligation is to young people in the type of situation created by the flds its not the dearth of brides im concerned about since youre right that no one is guaranteed the right to marry but the effects of the competition for those brides

3246597 some of the attractions will be similar to those that are available in the area now but adventure quest will put such a spin on them that theyll be different from anything seen before in this market

3246600 11 news anchor mindy basara nearly got more than she could handle when dr kim and mikey the chimp showed up
3246601 and the escort job market is so tight that as they enter generally theyre younger more beautiful more marketable and inevitably someone else will lose their job and be pushed out onto the street this elimination of the safe work environment and the undermining of the stability of our industry is creating the environment thats allowing workers to go missing and be killed at levels that are just ridiculous
3246602 we overwhelmingly heard women say build a house build a house build a house
3246603 safety dignity the ability to have a shower after meeting with a client to use a bathroom to know that theres somebody there that if they ring a bell they can get assistance if they need it the ability to negotiate with somebody semi privately not on a street corner so that everythings clear and everybody agrees to the details of the contract
3246604 under section 7 of the charter you can argue whats called gross disproportionality which is the harms created by the law grossly outweigh the benefits of the law you could not find a phrase thats better tailored to the prostitution argument because the idea of this prostitution case is simple the law puts prostitutes into situations that jeopardize their physical and psychological safety thats the harm of the law whats the benefit of the law this is where people just look at you dumbfounded
3246605 they just cant communicate which again leaves them vulnerable they have to get in the car and go around to a dark alley they dont have any sheets to question the client what do you like what dont you like and then afterwards wheres the cleanup you cant wash up you cant sanitize
3246606 in a house thats all available to you theres dignity theres self respect they can have a coffee and talk in my house we had a three page questionnaire so i could weed out the people i didnt want to deal with or refer them to people who do like to deal with that type of person
3246607 i think when you give women their freedom dignity and respect things change attitudes change and their opinions of themselves might change before they decide that theyre going to work for a pimp someone thats going to abuse them i think they might choose working independently in a house
3246608 the vancouver police dont use those laws a lot they use them some but theyre always a threat so they can be used i think that many of the arrests are usually complaint driven
3246609 the law really has very little bearing on their daily activities except for the fact that they are out there and they can be charged and they can be arrested for communication and they can get a criminal record for it but the law probably isnt front of mind in whatever they do women who work in the survival sex trade need all kinds of other supports like housing some financial security all the social determinants of health that they probably dont have and some nutrition
3246610 for the person with the drug addiction the harm is the drugs being used in this case the harm is being done by a john or a pimp so really if we were to reduce the harm it would be by what we say proposing to criminalize the men who are buying and selling the women
3246611 i think anything that legitimates prostitution as either work or a free choice among women entrenches the harm thats done to women and affects all womens equality
3246612 contrary to current media coverage of the issue the available evidence suggests that it decriminalization would in fact be harmful would expand prostitution and would promote trafficking and would only serve to make prostitution safer and more profitable for the men who exploit and harm prostituted women and children
3246613 the laws as they now stand dont protect women in the mainstream so we dont believe that the laws for prostitution being changed will protect women in that industry
3246614 there is no doubt that the winners here are the pimps the organized crime and frankly the state if were really looking at ending violence against women why do we cut funding to womens centres why do we marginalize womens organizations rape crisis centres and why does the federal government put out a budget that mentions women six times and organizations 120 times
3246615 but that leaves nine other subsections of section 212 to deal with exploitive pimping im sick of people accusing me of bringing a case to create a pimps paradise
3246616 a lot of sex trade workers are deathly afraid of regulation and are willing to be criminalized to keep away from what they consider to be the horrible regime in nevada its a little off putting that you do three day shifts and youre not allowed to leave during the three days unless youre chaperoned the medical testing is overbearing

3246629 one of the two was present at every session of the trial it is the opinion of both of these consular officers that the israeli military authorities made no real effort to investigate the charges of mistreatment indeed both the military judge and the prosecutor made it clear throughout the trial that they considered the questions of mistreatment and coercion to be irrelevant and trivial they also made it clear from the start that the trials result was preordained
3246630 the post fully understands israels legitimate concern over security on the west bank and accepts the premise that a military occupation regime may necessarily supercede the basic civil and human rights which are expected in a free democratic state living in a state of peace
3246631 since 1987 the general security service gss interrogators have tortured thousands of detainees intentionally inflicting severe pain and suffering the torture was neither extraordinary nor limited to ticking bombs quite the opposite torture was a bureaucratic routine there was standard equipment for inflicting torture and careful recording of the times the pain and suffering were inflicted even the states response in petitions against torture repeated paragraph after paragraph the routine justification for what were supposedly extraordinary acts supervision of the gss did not succeed in preventing torture in israel from becoming routine systematic and institutionalized
3246632 israels 32 year occupation of the west bank and gaza has given rise to patterns of legal proceedings that undermine the rule of law and the democratic values of the state of israel

3246776 multichannel marketing metrics and methods for on and offline success
3246777 then well come a long way towards providing more relevant marketing and reducing spam
3246778 unlike other ad serving solutions directserve can measure an advertisers interactive marketing channels using their own business metrics rather than the standard impression click and conversion data thats been used in the past this technology will help advertisers solve the hurdle of integrating interactive marketing across channels and help them better assess media performance based on such direct marketing dimensions such as lifetime value shopping cart contents and product preferences
3246779 our findings are particularly relevant for neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinsons and alzheimers
3246780 many of these diseases are due to misbehaving or damaged proteins that accumulate in neurons by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
3246781 that was enough to maintain a clean liver and to prove that if you keep your cells clean they work better
3246782 now that we know that repairing that defect is enough to restore a system to its youth we will start screening compounds

3246790 i have an offer for you if you want it he said why dont you come hear it out
3246791 i will if you want but before i do let me say that you could earn up to 1000 dollars per night be fed and housed in luxury as part of the deal and only have intercourse when and if you choose
3246792 that would be up to you and my boss my young friend
3246793 if your in your in now thats the deal no other options are available so what will it be
3246794 i was able to put my all into this i did everything i could to prepare so i dont have any regrets

3246798 we need to have a strong verification regime in order to remove north korea from the list
3246799 they know what they need to do on a verification package and were continuing to work with them
3246800 we continue to try to work with them on this question of a robust verification regime
3246801 but we arent at the point where we are satisfied with what they have put on the table thus far
3246802 if the administration lifted sanctions anyway without verification it would have just shot our credibility in the whole region
3246803 if i like someone on a first date i would rather end the date with a nice cup of tea coffee or other warm drink than by spending the night with them
3246804 the findings suggest that boy george understood human psychology better than sigmund freud
3246805 id rather have a cup of tea than go to bed with someone
3246806 the americans were going to smash them thats what we came here for
3246807 ive gone to a driving range before and hit golf balls because i saw tiger woods doing it on tv
3246808 i want more minority kids to go to a swimming pool and try to swim because of me i know im nowhere near tiger woods but i want to make a difference i want kids to say look a black swimmer and hes got a gold medal and i want them to get in the water because of it
3246809 lets say two kids are walking beside a pool and one decides it would be funny to push the other one in
3246810 if the one who gets pushed in can swim yeah maybe its funny if he cant youve got a real problem
3246811 sometimes they dont fit the mold you imagine not all kids are going to grow up and be doctors
3246812 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3246813 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3246814 its all about my dad this year said rice a fifth year senior
3246815 he put in all this time throughout his life to come to see me in person and now hes not going to be able to do that but im going to make it special for him hes got a great view thats for sure
3246816 the only way to describe it is i felt like it was the worst nightmare id ever been in for that first 20 minutes but you dont wake up chase rice said
3246817 he would just reassure me say something like son i know who you are and i know this isnt going to stop you
3246818 and here he was going through cancer and you would never know it he lived his life like those guys in the bucket list if he could do that there was no question in my mind that i would come back and play again too
3246819 he really is an excellent leader coach butch davis said of chase rice who is practicing as a first team linebacker
3246820 he wants so much for this football program to have a good season and i think that his fathers death adds a little bit of a burning passion inside of him to do well and i certainly hope he has the type of season he wants to have this year
3246821 i just remember that he never sat down said offensive lineman garrett reynolds one of chase rices good friends and roommates
3246822 so that first game its going to be especially hard
3246823 but chase keeps saying his dad has got front row seats so i think hes going to play lights out every play play with every bit of his heart
3246824 therefore you now have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart will rejoice and your joy no one will take from you
3246825 its a good situation that you can ask that question
3246826 i have probably been the leading player in europe for close to six years it is a big step now to move up and start competing on a different level ive got phil ive got tiger ahead of me i dont necessarily pay attention to what theyre doing i pay attention to more what im doing
3246827 we are going to take on an underdog role in this ryder cup for the first time in a long time even on paper when you look at the strength of the european squad
3246828 my daughter who has my two young grandkids mentioned him to me last night
3246829 i had heard about him but she mentioned him again and how proud she was and what kind of work he was doing
3246830 i think thats definitely something that has always been in the back of his mind
3246831 i tried to tell him to get into the water awhile ago and he was like no
3246832 or if i have enough money after i finish paying my bills maybe even twice a day
3246833 i think its more of a socio economic factor where there are some kids that just dont get the exposure to swimming and others that do
3246834 i cant really gauge whether the interest is there because the minorities are there or because they have no other option or because theyre directed to this pool or what
3246835 playing special teams here for three years and kind of being told indirectly that thats your role on this team and then having a team come out and say hey weve seen your preseason film of you starting
3246836 something ive wanted teams to see since ive been in the nfl
3246837 i felt like it wouldve been a great opportunity to finally get in there and jump start my career and show what i do can on the field as a starter not just as a special teams player
3246838 it was crazy to see a team like new england who everybody views as like the gurus of scouting who do such a great job of bringing in late round picks and turning them into superstars
3246839 so when they came calling it was a tremendous honor
3246840 most of our linebackers here are 230 pounds but ive been 250 to 255 pounds and when youre that big sometimes taking on blocks and being inside is a better fit
3246841 as far as 3 4 or 4 3 i think i fit well in both schemes but obviously being a bigger linebacker i think you have a little bit more value in a 3 4
3246842 is come out in practice every day and in my games and do the best i can
3246843 the value of var1 is 0 the value of var2 is 1

3246852 we cant stop those big trucks on a dime and we cant start as fast as normal traffic i know the citizens of lawrence dont want us to be on that street and we dont want to be on it either

3246854 we havent done a study of how much truck traffic originates or ends in lawrence

3246867 he says he is attracted to horses and couldnt resist it when he saw the animal in the field
3246868 we thought wed seen everything but this beats them all
3246869 il pianeta x sta arrivando e la norvegia ha cominciato con lapprovvigionamento di cibo e sementi nella zona di svalbard e nel nord artico con laiuto degli us e ue e di tutto il paese

3246885 no dont hit anyone turn the other cheek dont resist an evil person
3246886 this whole mess is really my fault i started it and im going to finish it
3246887 precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints
3246888 it is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting for death is the destiny of every man the living should take this to heart
3246889 sorrow is better than laughter because a sad face is good for the heart the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure
3246890 would we have sinned if we didnt know what sinning was
3246891 oh thatw as a sin back there i shouldnt have done that
3246892 my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness
3246893 we know that anyone born of god does not continue to sin
3246894 before you answer your wife rid yourself of malice treat her how you want to be treated
3246895 you must be consistent if you want anyone to believe what you say
3246896 if you want me to hear you make sure you get eye contact and acknowledgement before speaking otherwise since im already having a conversation with either myself or god or both im not going to hear you or register that youre even talking to me and plus its kind of rude to interrupt when someone else is talking isnt it
3246897 why would god give limits knowing it would cause sin
3246898 at calvary christ accepted responsibility for the introduction of moral evil into the universe
3246899 for god has shut up all in disobedience so that he may show mercy to all
3246900 therefore the law has become our tutor to lead us to christ so that we may be justified by faith
3246901 but nobody can say they have the absolute assurance that theyll get it
3246902 at this level everybody is so prepared physically and the level of gymnastics is so high but it comes down a lot of times to your nerves
3246903 i dont think we will see the same situation in the team finals
3246904 i think we will have a very good fight with the chinese on three up three count
3246905 reafirma o compromisso dos estados membros da onu com a soberania a independ ncia e a integridade territorial da ge rgia dentro de suas fronteiras internacionalmente reconhecidas
3246906 we havent had time to do anything outside of practice games scouting its been videos every day meetings every day the last time we came we had free time to see tiananmen square the great wall this time around no
3246907 i think that hurt her chances but there wasnt much she could do about that
3246908 you have the opportunity to see new places and do new things you work with other great coaches you can learn from and i always bring back some great things when i come home at duke and now at texas
3246909 yes theyre just moving along without me theyre pretty self sufficient
3246910 i miss everyone there but it looks like everyone has been able to move on
3246911 it will always be home to me and my family
3246912 what would ever possess a union cna to come to ohio and destroy something wed worked so hard to build
3246913 when a union election is called by the hospital you have to question what that means
3246914 is it a deal to do business or a voice for workers fundamentally what well lose with such deals is the right to advocate for our patients
3246915 the announcement of the release of final fantasy xiii on xbox 360 at this years e3 is at the moment still at the planning stage we dont have any further information regarding the releasing date or the possibility of localization
3246916 theres really no more to say than that as announced at e3
3246917 we cant continue to perform this way late in the game
3246918 we have to make some adjustments i have to figure out what i have and who is willing to step up in those roles
3246919 today was a big win for us a big win
3246920 we have to refocus and not allow this to cross over into this road trip
3246921 i didnt want to let the team down like i did previously
3246922 i got in there worked the count and got the pitch that i was waiting for
3246923 it was real big for these guys to really pull together and come back
3246924 especially 5 1 down and didnt look like anything was going our way at all
3246925 just being able to stick with the routine between starts
3246926 being able to run and lift and throw on the side the same things that i would typically do
3246927 its a positive effect for anybody that wants to stay in the rotation
3246928 we were swinging at davids pitches instead of having a better plan
3246929 in this information age and the very complicated world in which we live today the need for high quality reporting is greater than ever its not just the journalists job at risk here its american democracy it is freedom consolidation and cost cutting may be good for the bottom line in the short term but that isnt necessarily good for the country or the health of the news business in the long term
3246930 well we could sell the front page its a big piece of real estate nobodys using
3246931 well throw something else against the wall and hope it sticks
3246932 i say we send not one more cent of taxpayer money to fund the iraq reconstruction while the maliki government is running surpluses and failing to pay for the rebuilding of the country
3246933 theres a line between being responsible for rebuilding a country that you have helped destroy and being a chump and i think weve crossed the line
3246934 dipersulit nanti saya izinkan deh nggak ada dipersulit kalau lp nya sudah menerima tidak ada wewenang kejaksaan untuk mempersulit akan saya kasih izin
3246935 you think youre the only one out there until you get in a group like this
3246936 people who have kids are rushing around trying to hold down kids job family its nice to know theres a way to battle that
3246937 for so many people womens health is about babies and breast cancer
3246938 focus on gratitude for what you have today lost dreams are a dime a dozen
3246939 its an inviting place so we want to make it available to the community
3246940 if we charge according to the square footage the mice might have to pay the same amount
3246941 i find it very insulting to be continually omitted from your paper and consider it rather unjust to the community to be completely ignored in articles of events where i was present
3246942 the ignoring and lack of reporting by the w amp b times on events and stories that i have undertaken on behalf of my constituents in brent can no longer be passed as circumstantial coincidences but only as a bias against me
3246943 its all water off a ducks back we will continue to be as critical of politicians as we can be and no doubt continue to offend them in the coming months and years
3246944 i am delighted i have finally been cleared but its not just a personal victory this is an important ruling for the media as a whole had i been convicted it would have been an extremely dangerous precedent
3246945 i couldnt have been any clearer in introducing myself as a reporter during the interview i also requested photographs to be set up for a national sunday newspaper and i handed over my own business card
3246946 yet when the man i was interviewing and his family claimed they didnt fully understand who i was i found myself arrested charged and summoned to appear in the court where i worked every day
3246947 i still find it hard to get my head round the fact this could happen to a bona fide reporter doing a perfectly routine job in a transparent way in modern scotland it is quite unbelievable
3246948 i am extremely grateful for the support and backing of all my colleagues at deadline my employers never wavered in their belief in me
3246949 lauren is a first class reporter both honest and committed frankly it was outrageous she should have found herself in this situation at all
3246950 she has been through a year of hell worrying about the possible impact the court proceedings could have on both her personal and work life all for doing her job in a totally honest and transparent way
3246951 i have spent 20 years in the scottish media and everyone i have spoken to has expressed nothing but disbelief that this should have happened at all i dread to think how much this ludicrous case has cost the taxpayer in wasted police procurator fiscal and court time
3246952 the time at glyndwr university will cover lectures and practical workshops leading to the chance to achieve a full set of nctj qualifications
3246953 but in addition under the partnership agreement students have the opportunity to put all this into practice in structured work placements at one of the nwn media titles for two days each week
3246954 we believe it is the first time a university and newspaper group have worked so closely together to produce such an integrated package of training for young journalists leading to the nctj qualifications
3246955 this exciting partnership between us as a news media company and an academic environment is the first of its kind and were very proud to be involved with wrexhams new university
3246956 this is the result of many months of planning and it is great news for north wales to have such a prestigious course leading to the industry standard nctj journalistic qualification being available in the region
3246957 god i love u and i need u come into my heart
3246958 because it was written dead fast and recorded dead fast the shock of the lightning basically is the demo and it has retained its energy and there s a lot to be said for that i think the first time you record something is always the best
3246959 we can spread the ball around pretty easily in the wing t
3246960 i think there will be plenty of touches for our backs
3246961 we are looking at moving joshua to fullback so that we can keep him on the field and work him with both aziel and david
3246962 we should contend for our fourth straight greater neuse championship and tournament championship
3246963 we will be young compared to previous years but we expect great senior leadership
3246964 in addition to supporting kucinichs bill h res 333 i would also support a similar impeachment resolution against bush especially after the disgraceful scooter libby sentence
3246965 smoking is bad for the lungs why would any doctor recommend something so harmful
3246966 smoking has been the route of choice for many cannabis users because it delivers a more rapid hit and allows more accurate dose titration
3246967 at this point i guess we want to keep all of our options open
3246968 ill just have to tell them theres going to be a minor delay until we get these things nailed down
3246969 i think historically young miss softball has always gotten the hind end of everything
3246970 this is an opportunity for them to have a much improved facility
3246971 we have to have something here for our retired people
3246972 garantizar la seguridad de los usuarios del transporte a reo y evitar la competencia desleal en el sector
3246973 la principal atracci n para los turistas extranjeros contin a siendo el turismo cultural en especial para conocer el santuario de machu picchu
3246974 la comida peruana ya es reconocida a nivel internacional como una de las tres principales en el mundo junto con la china y la italiana
3246975 all i can tell you is that there are a few sticking points remaining we could be in for a long night but everyone hopes that there will be a more definite picture late today or some time monday
3246976 just stick around you can go and pray today is sunday
3246977 they beat me like a dog political persecution of opposition activists and supporters in zimbabwe
3246978 zanu pf and its allies are still committing violent abuses undermining the partys credibility as a political partner
3246979 instead of focusing on quick political fixes president thabo mbeki and other sadc leaders should look for a durable solution and that means first of all an immediate end to human rights violations
3246980 i am an old woman and they beat me like a dog no a wild animal they insulted me they beat me on the back and in the ribs my only crime was that my son was an mdc councilor i am in great pain now my son is in the mortuary i am unable to bury him i will not be there when he is buried if he is buried i regret being alive my life is ruined my home is destroyed and my sons life was taken in cold blood
3246981 there can be no trade off between the political process and the need for justice and an end to human rights abuses
3246982 the zimbabwean governments refusal to account for serious crimes will only damage the prospects for political stability in zimbabwe sadc leaders can make a difference by insisting that abusers be held to account under any political deal
3246983 the fact that the daily mail may have been in breach of section 97 itself does not mean that she can properly complain
3246984 it seems to me to be a clear case where the courts conscience is offended by the fact that the prosecution is brought by a person who by her conduct was likely if not certain to identify the child as being the subject of proceedings to which section 97 applied
3246985 el secreto est en hacer las cosas bien y dar a nuestros clientes lo mismo que nos gustar a recibir a nosotros

3246999 la crisis est ah y se nota a todos los niveles

3247006 asusta un poco ver a todo el mundo exaltado quiero decir no se trata del segundo advenimiento de cristo sino de un juego espero ansioso que killzone 2 est completado pero toda la publicidad que hay en internet puede llegar a dar miedo en la actualidad cualquier rumor que se repita en cinco foros diferentes y dos medios de comunicaci n se transforma m gicamente en un hecho y se a ade a nuestra lista de funciones
3247007 claro que meu objetivo conquistar medalha mas amanh s vou nadar para me divertir

3247013 de boodschap geen buitenactiviteiten plannen n goed opletten in het verkeer
3247014 een kanaalrat is een stormdepressie die zich begint te ontwikkelen boven de atlantische oceaan
3247015 via het kanaal en het nauw van calais komt het richting onze kust met stormen overvloedige neerslag en hevige rukwinden als gevolg omdat de stormen zich net voor het vasteland pas echt gaan ontwikkelen kunnen de weermodellen ze moeilijk inschatten
3247016 de kans dat belgi vandaag met een zuivere kanaalrat geconfronteerd wordt is klein maar toch kunnen we niet uitsluiten dat een kleine kanaalrat onze regio dinsdag zal teisteren aan de kust kan dat zorgen voor forse windstoten van 7 tot misschien zelfs 8 beaufort in het binnenland van 6 tot 7 beaufort
3247017 het is ook oppassen voor felle neerslag in het westen van het land zal er 15 tot 20 milliliter vallen dat is veel als je weet dat het maandgemiddelde in ons land vaak rond de 60 milliliter ligt

3247019 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3247020 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3247021 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3247022 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3247023 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3247024 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3247025 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3247026 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3247027 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3247028 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3247029 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3247030 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3247031 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3247032 hij keert vandaag terug hsv heeft de voetbalbond onder druk gezet omdat er een afspraak was gemaakt dat kompany na twee wedstrijden zou terugkeren

3247046 i am very pleased with our overall results during the first half of 2008 after two years of a very hard work the company is finally getting back to the performance track the main drivers for the growth were continuing and solid demand for high definition tv products combined with successful customer base expansion helped by the european football championship and the beijing olympic games increased profitability was largely a result of improved efficiencies favorable product mix and streamlined supply chain operations it is also an impressive achievement from our staff whom i wholeheartedly congratulate for this we are now set for the second half of 2008
3247047 abgesehen vom handelsergebnis rechnen wir mit einem soliden zweiten quartal
3247048 es ist wichtig zu erw hnen dass sich speedels finanzielles ergebnis weiter im rahmen unserer vorhersage entwickelt insbesondere durch verminderte betriebliche aufwendungen als ergebnis einer fokussierung der f amp e ausgaben auf die am meisten erfolg versprechenden projekte
3247049 das vermietgesch ft geht nicht zur ck aber es gibt warnzeichen am horizont
3247050 ich kann mir nicht vorstellen dass die guidance ge ndert wird
3247051 damit w rde leoni einen der positivsten ausblicke der branche machen

3247057 vi tar ett glas vin ist llet f r en kopp kaffe
3247058 hey eduard met mij gaat het wel goed alhoewel ik longemfyseem heb en 24 uur per dag aan de zuurstof ben
3247059 hahaha k heb darmkanker en lig per week 5 uur aan het infuus en het h lpt
3247060 dat is mooi wat wij hebben wordt uiteindelijk onze dood maar ik hoop het nog tien jaar te rekken
3247061 fala se tanto em falta de profissionais qualificados e n o percebem que a lei do aprendiz pode resolver esse problema
3247062 i put in a tremendous amount of work meeting all these requirements when i could have put that work into the actual game and made it even a little more polished little bit better
3247063 but i feel like it actually decreases the quality of games because people spend so much of their energy on these things that users dont even really care about
3247064 what would keep me from putting another game on arcade again is just that theyve changed the business deal at least as ive heard if its as ive heard that it is i couldnt even necessarily break even
3247065 in the short term it may lead to job dislocation of poor fishers whose products like tuna and salmon will face zero tariff at the onset of jpepa
3247066 jpepas investment provisions which allow japanese corporations and nationals to own and control private agricultural lands will promote the rapid expansion of plantations producing for japans market
3247067 increased japanese investments in agribusiness will surely deprive mindanao which is already suffering from the consequences of a mere 60 per cent rice sufficiency of the land and resources needed to ensure its food security
3247068 the largest numbers of unemployed fishers ever are trying to emigrate to europe using their small fishing boats and pirogues which leads to a number of people dying on the high seas
3247069 the european union can satisfy only 50 percent of its internal demand for fish from its own fish resources the deficit has been filled for years through access
3247070 european fishery operators present in senegalese waters contribute significantly to the overexploitation of fishing stocks and provide little long term gains for the industry
3247071 from a peak of 10 707 pirogues in 1997 the fleet declined to a mere 5 615 in 2005
3247072 many fishing companies are only operating part time due to the severe supply deficits of high value species and the average volume of fish exports has fallen by a total of 32 percent over the course of the past 15 years this has led to companies laying off 50 60 percent of their staff
3247073 the full economic partnership agreements proposed by the european commission which include services and investment provisions are likely to lock in and worsen such practices
3247074 companies which fish with a proper licence routinely exceed the quotas they are granted as senegal doesnt have enough resources to patrol its waters
3247075 fishing authorities also have problems controlling boats that move from one fishing zone to another while crossing borders
3247076 trawler owners play with different licenses and if they cant get a license from senegal they have no problem obtaining one from a neighbouring country
3247077 between 1997 and 2001 aerial surveys of guineas territorial waters found that 60 percent of the 2 313 vessels spotted were committing offences surveys of sierra leone and guinea bissau over the same period found levels of illegal fishing at 24 percent of 947 vessels and 24 of 926 vessels respectively
3247078 a european ship owner forms a joint venture to enable his boats to fly the senegalese flag this allows him to avoid strict controls and access to fish in waters reserved to senegalese boats
3247079 a permanent suspension of the fisheries agreements the imposition of biological rest periods and reinforced surveillance of territorial waters
3247080 im not against the olympics but feel that giving them to china has diluted the reality around the human rights abuses that exist and condones what is happening in tibet
3247081 we are here simply to remember tibet and to promote the fact that it needs to be considered at this time
3247082 we want to keep the focus on doing something positive and in line with the tibetan belief system of non violence and compassion
3247083 saya pikir pada suatu waktu kami bisa mengintimidasi ketika anda punya pemain pemain yang bisa berhadapan satu lawan satu dengan lawan seperti yang kami miliki di skuad kami itu adalah hal yang paling mengintimidasi
3247084 kami bisa menghadapi perlakuan terkeras dari bek eropa atau inggris para pemain depan kami sangat mengintimidasi untuk dilawan saya bermain melawan mereka dalam latihan
3247085 tiga atau empat pemain depan kami bisa bermain di semua posisi dan itu menyulitkan lawan mereka lawan tak tahu siapa yang akan mereka hadapi dari menit ke menit apalagi dari pertandingan ke pertandingan buat kami itu bagus
3247086 kami masih memiliki kedisplinan bertahan di tim dan semuanya bercampur bersama itu paduan yang bagus

3247090 a significant growth in officer grade employment of sri lankan seafarers was evident in the recent past although sri lanka could not capitalize fully on this opportunity as desired due to non availability of training berths for cadets on board ships
3247091 in fact we are unable to cater to the global demand for seafarers although we can produce more officer category seafarers we are constrained due to not having adequate training berths on board vessels
3247092 accommodation on container ship is very limited to accommodate extra cadets
3247093 this is one area of difficulty this is because we dont have a specialised training ship in the old days the ceylon shipping corporation the national carrier provided onboard training
3247094 if ship owners provide more berths we can double our intake
3247095 ship owners are now realising the difficulty as they themselves face crew shortages and are trying to help
3247096 penelope had less facial hair than a guy so it was certainly more pleasant it was better than kissing jonathan rhys meyers in match point kissing him wasnt that bad but he did have to stop and shave in the middle of a scene even though hed shaved that morning the man has really got some beard on him

3247103 i dont have an extra room for an extra bed
3247104 i have an extra bassinet you can have ill get my husband to drop it off at your place this evening your back is never going to recover until you get that baby out of your bed
3247105 co sleeping with your baby is dangerous you could roll over and squash him
3247106 ive got a boob right here thanks and in case you hadnt noticed my babys calm almost all the time without a pacifier

3247113 parents do not have a constitutional right to homeschool their children
3247114 we conclude that california statutes permit homeschooling as a species of private school education
3247115 the california appeals court shocked the nation with its ruling in february
3247116 we decided as part of a broad survey of more than 1 200 adult americans to get their reaction and found that 61 percent strongly agreed that the constitution guarantees the right of parents to homeschool and another 25 percent agreed somewhat
3247117 americans appear to believe that parents not the government should decide whether or not they should homeschool
3247118 a primary purpose of the educational system is to train school children in good citizenship patriotism and loyalty to the state and the nation as a means of protecting the public welfare
3247119 as is the case with polling research we are not asking if something is true but rather what people believe
3247120 and it is important to note that americans do believe that schooling at home leads to issues with social skills and this is a perception that homeschooling families need to overcome
3247121 just want assurance that they are in a healthy relationship that they can make it when the storms of life hit them and that they have the skills necessary to do what is healthy
3247122 my pastor never really probed in our relationship to discover how healthy we were emotionally or spiritually or relationally
3247123 that counselor really helped us examine our relationship to make sure we were approaching marriage for healthy reasons
3247124 if youre with someone and trying to decide if your problems should keep you apart or if you should try to work through them then why not get counseling before you get engaged
3247125 once the engagement ring sits on a womans finger the couple generally loses most of its objectivity about the relationship
3247126 couples are a lot more willing to stop and deal with a problem prior to engagement because they havent made that public commitment to friends and family
3247127 we couldnt figure out why we fought so much and still wanted to be together
3247128 we said lets go ahead and do it now because we dont want to get engaged get all excited get everyone else all excited and then break it off
3247129 the counselor was able to help us appreciate where each other was coming from and allow us to respect each other rather than just saying youre wrong
3247130 couples tend to remember how to apply the tools of conflict resolution
3247131 values that are sympathetic to your concerns at the spiritual end of your relationship
3247132 they the therapists have got to spend some time figuring you out just because theyre therapists does not mean they can just meet you and know
3247133 doing everything they couples know to do to ensure that this is going to be a happy relationship
3247134 claire id suggest you and nathan try this simple prescription
3247135 a house is built by wisdom and it is established by understanding by knowledge the rooms are filled with every precious and beautiful treasure
3247136 i dont know about soul mates but i do know that my spouse and i are laugh mates
3247137 i dont think id be where i am now without having the faith i have
3247138 i dont know that i would have been able to persevere without knowing that the lord was in control and he had his hand on me and was working through everything ive gone through
3247139 the americans havent won a medal in road cycling since 1984 so its been a long time
3247140 i think well come away disappointed if we dont win one
3247141 i think there were a lot of people praying for me at the time
3247142 i remember being an eighth grader and having a really good understanding of his grace and what it meant to be a christian
3247143 i think my faith was pretty far along pretty early
3247144 i knew there was something athletically special about what i could do but i kept getting hurt
3247145 i could never do enough miles to be competitive i walked to the other side of the track where the bleachers were i climbed to the top and sat there and cried for an hour and a half i sat in the cold i cried i prayed i sat in silence
3247146 all of a sudden you have a really clear understanding of what it means when jesus said to paul my grace is sufficient
3247147 at the time i was going through those four years it was such a roller coaster now when i look back im so thankful for it and i wouldnt change any of it because of how it built my faith and developed a foundation for me for who i am now
3247148 the people that knew me and had been around me knew that something had happened that i didnt do anything
3247149 my worry was more with the people who really didnt know me for me that was the hardest thing knowing that my witness was a little bit scarred in that sense but the people who knew me they knew my faith they knew my integrity and how i walked and that it was never something that i would intentionally do
3247150 i consider myself a christian before i consider myself an athlete
3247151 so how i act how i talk how i race i try to do that as a christian first im not going to put someone in the ditch i try to race with integrity and class i try to do things professionally in a way that hopefully accurately represents christ
3247152 the lords been good to me and hes always been there with me
3247153 ive learned to give thanks in all situations just knowing that the lords in control his plans are bigger and better than anything that i could ever imagine
3247154 it was inventive on his part ill give him that
3247155 and this is very illegal so the following material is for educational use only
3247156 it is extremely important to maintain the security and integrity of the fare media systems
3247157 with an insecure compromised system even basic revenue controls to name one example become significantly challenging
3247158 if you prevent legitimate researchers from talking about their findings its not going to stop people from finding vulnerabilities its going to stop the good guys from talking about them and from learning from each other
3247159 the bad guys are still going to be looking for the vulnerabilities and still be finding them
3247160 the 529 college savings plans are the best thing going when saving for your kids college education
3247161 many families dont understand all of the aid and scholarship opportunities that are available
3247162 government money is awarded on a first come first served basis and a lot of scholarships are based on how you fill out that fafsa form
3247163 sixty five percent of people who fill out the fafsa fill it out incorrectly so it gets sent back if applicants dont fix it they may get reduced or no aid
3247164 you should not sacrifice your retirement to pay for your childs education
3247165 although saving enough for a good college education is essential parents dont need to feel ashamed for saving for their retirement its ok for students to attend well reputed less expensive colleges
3247166 children should work and help contribute to their college costs
3247167 show children the value of money and that money is earned teach children about the proper use of money and the value of a dollar
3247168 because we need some privacy we do not want your children to come into our yard or house unless they are invited
3247169 we do not want your children to climb on our fence or use our patio chairs for play since we want to keep our property in good condition
3247170 a missional sunday school is a reproducing community of authentic disciples being equipped as missionaries sent by god to live and proclaim his word in their world
3247171 love the lord your god with all your heart with all your soul and with all your strength
3247172 be witnesses in jerusalem in all judea and samaria and to the ends of the earth
3247173 for i know the plans i have for you this is the lords declaration plans for your welfare not for disaster to give you a future and a hope
3247174 i have come that they may have life and have it in abundance
3247175 i may not know what the future holds but i know who holds the future
3247176 for everyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved
3247177 wouldnt you like to have the kind of relationship with jesus these verses describe
3247178 dear jesus i confess you to be my lord i repent of sin and surrender my life to you i believe that you are alive that you are god thank you for saving me amen
3247179 we are excited about the opportunity to be a part of midlothian and the surrounding communities
3247180 we look forward to serving people and churches by providing them with biblical solutions for life
3247181 if they raise prices they may see demand drop or they can opt for a higher market share with no price hikes which only large corporations can survive they are in trouble either way
3247182 profit margins are getting slimmer for companies in sectors such as electrical machinery or automobiles as consumer spending is weak
3247183 pentagon reports that icij obtained through freedom of information act requests show that pakistan is the no 1 recipient of these funds receiving more than 10 times the amount that went to the no 2 recipient poland and that there is scant documentation of how the money was used
3247184 most of the u s bases are based in balochistan
3247185 one or two of them are in kharan my own home district the u s is using the bases in this area for the war on terror we are very supportive of the u s in this role
3247186 we cant overstate what weve been able to accomplish with pakistans help
3247187 intended to yield some sort of specific action on the part of the government
3247188 the u s has paid relatively little attention to human rights abuses and oversight people werent paying attention
3247189 right from the beginning it was very difficult to pin down what the costs were and how they were computed initially there were very round numbers reported now figures are coming out with more specificity whether or not they are inflated its difficult to get a handle on that
3247190 the president determines and certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that the government of pakistan is making all possible efforts to prevent the taliban from operating in areas under its sovereign control
3247191 counterproductive to the important goal of fostering a closer relationship
3247192 the a q khan tentacles havent all been uncovered at some level the chain may still be in operation the u s and iaea international atomic energy agency havent had access to him to this day
3247193 the american supplied military arsenal has been used against baloch nationalists
3247194 sophisticated helicopters bought to control the drug trade have been misused against the baloch people
3247195 and the state department says the u s has given military hardware with no conditions
3247196 the pakistani army stepped in with a pretty heavy hand last year
3247197 i dont think hell ever deliver what he says he will the u s government is all musharraf all the time and the u s goal is to keep him in place to keep the army happy
3247198 pakistan is a solid dictatorship the u s is being taken for a big ride musharraf is not the right person for the war powerful sections of the isi remain involved with the taliban theyre waiting for time biding their time
3247199 this is real this is me im exactly where im supposed to be

3247205 having our own teams gives us more flexibility to allocate our resources where they need to be

3247212 british officials have avoided pointing the finger at moscow but emergency talks continued monday over the former spys death an issue that could overshadow tough negotiations over energy issues and russias cooperation on irans nuclear ambitions
3247213 in the strongest comments leveled at moscow since the poisoning cabinet minister peter hain on sunday accused russian president vladimir putin of presiding over
3247214 the west has been craven in turning a blind eye to putins mockery of democracy and freedom it has looked on and pretended not to see the atrocities in chechnya and anna politkovskaya has herself become the latest in a sad procession of journalists who have been silenced because they dared to speak out about the truth
3247215 putins mentality is cold cynical unpleasant he nurtures racism and a populist kind of nationalism he suppresses freedom of the media voices of dissent he tolerates endemic corruption and bribery at all levels of society with his increasing stranglehold on the media russias young democracy is slipping back towards a state where individuals must be subordinated to the power at the top this former kgb fsb officer has all the macho posturing and unimaginative stunted ruthlessness of soviet figures from the past he is the classic little man
3247216 laugh and the world laughs with you weep and you weep alone
3247217 a variety of artificial turf products were evaluated for risk exposure to lead and the bottom line is parents should not be concerned about harmful levels of lead in artificial turf
3247218 they could not be trusted to protect children from lead in baby bibs or lunch boxes and now we see that they cant be trusted to protect children from lead in turf
3247219 however much of what is reported in crawfords blog may be falsified material
3247220 it never happened and crawfords only cited source was a wikipeida article which some believe he edited to include the false story so he could then cite it in his blog

3247245 i dont know they are working on her what happened
3247246 jill tried to help and he threw her into the wall

3247248 you are only mine until we find out what is going on with jill and where you want to go from there do you understand
3247249 is this because of jerry that you came to me
3247250 it made me very sad when he died did you and jill trust him
3247251 i have to do my work here in the infirmary straighten the rooms and refill everything you can help me
3247252 we have to let the doctors do their work we wont be able to find out about jill for a while they had to sedate her

3247256 skull fracture swelling he said she needs surgery to relieve the pressure
3247257 no were giving her oxygen to keep the swelling down and were supposed to keep her under for a few days and then see how she is when she wakes up
3247258 shes in sub mode elaine said she could only sit with jill a little while

3247263 elaine said you could only sit with jill a little while when she says you have to leave you can stay in one of the patient rooms with joseph for the night so that you will be close by
3247264 given that the nc is adamant to allowing us to have the defence ministry in a government led by us we talked with the cpn uml about ways to find solutions to this state of deadlock and we even urged the cpn uml to lead the government if they wish to
3247265 both the cpn m and nc have urged us to lead the next government but we are stressing forming a national consensus government incorporating at least four major parties
3247266 the aetiology of deep venous thrombosis a critical historical and epistemological survey
3247267 im not jumping up and down we didnt win the game number one number two we came up on the short side of the turnover ratio thats not what were looking for as a football team
3247268 but theres a lot of productivity in all three phases and thats what well build off of
3247269 james told me he should have caught it and i told him i should have just taken a little bit off it
3247270 thats a ball youd love to have back and just take a little bit off it not realizing hes going to be that wide open
3247271 i felt like i had a little stinger going down my shoulder but other than that it was all right it wasnt that hard of a hit it probably looked hard but it wasnt that hard i was able to regroup
3247272 we just need to execute a little better in certain situations we had a chance to make some plays we made some but left a couple out there as well
3247273 i felt like it was important for me to make some good decisions out there manage the game and play well and i felt like i threw the ball pretty well maybe one or two decisions id like to have back but i thought it was a good start to the preseason
3247274 its not a bad start its a foundation and its training well have some good opportunities to grow and train ourselves and well continue to do so and get ourselves ready for when its for real
3247275 it was cecilias idea to apply the technology to wine
3247276 when she spoke with people in the industry they would tell her they needed a quick way to determine the components of a wine without having to send it off to a lab
3247277 it should even be able to identify say a chardonnay regardless of whether it was grown in france or california
3247278 you could use it to verify that a wine was made from the proper grapes
3247279 for example there are only five authorized grapes for a rioja but lots of winemakers sneak in cabernet anyway this could help enforce the standards
3247280 this is a way for them to verify a vintage
3247281 wine is one of the most complex chemical substances out there and no human palate can quantify its makeup objectively this kind of electronic device can
3247282 the human palate is unable to detect that a wine is say 20 merlot a device with a full range would be an awesome tool for explaining the mystery of what goes into a wine
3247283 this kind of device is purely technical its the human palate that determines whether a wine is worth drinking
3247284 we must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people especially children to be victims
3247285 this is aimed at helping young people in our city this is not an attempt to be punitive
3247286 the aclu of connecticut opposes juvenile curfews because theyre essentially a violation of fundamental rights of innocent people
3247287 curfews essentially are placing an entire demographic in this case youth under house arrest for the inappropriate actions of a few
3247288 it got to the point where somebody was going to get seriously hurt or killed if we didnt do something
3247289 these battleground states are good reflections of the nation as a whole
3247290 the youth vote both religious and non religious are likely to show the same patterns at the national level if they religious youth can have an impact nationally they will have an impact in the battleground states
3247291 the abandoning of politics as usual an opportunity for the underrepresented to have a voice
3247292 obama is the face of the christian youth generation moreso than anybody else
3247293 a vast majority of my friends believe mccain is the face of the christian youth vote today
3247294 upholds the christian values and he acknowledges that god should be kept in public places
3247295 young religious voters are looking for a president who will keep our nation safe while expanding economic opportunity and promoting our common values in this election young religious voters will see that john mccain has the leadership values and vision we need in our next president
3247296 our campaign is reaching out to young people of all faiths including evangelicals by holding house parties hosting events with key supporters and even holding rock concerts faith has been an important part of senator obamas life and he shares the commitment that millions of young evangelicals and people of all faith have to changing the world around them
3247297 a lot of people who will vote for mccain because of his view on israel and a lot of people will vote for obama because of his view of change and his objectivity to tackle foreign policy issues
3247298 because of the nature of the contest this time around both parties having highly contesting races
3247299 in touch with issues that matter to young people and he views them as beneficiaries to todays policies
3247300 what i am when i hear him is inspired and i dont get that from other politicians
3247301 mccain has a stronger allegiance and better stance on israel
3247302 there is more to electing the next president of the united states than being a good speaker
3247303 turnout is critical and the only votes that count are the votes that are cast
3247304 our troops are making advances we are hoping for success
3247305 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3247307 the product segment in india has the potential to grow 10 times its current size and touch anything between 9 5 and 12 billion over the next decade we have a lot of work to do and have identified all the stakeholders who can make this happen
3247308 with new models like soa and saas now maturing the opportunity exists for indian product development to take the global spotlight this will need focus on breakthrough innovation and global marketing with access to multi level funding an ecosystem for creativity must evolve in the leader and challenger locations to enable this and nasscom is committed to making this happen
3247309 the indian software product story so far has been an export driven story with 68 per cent of the revenues coming from just exports of these products however going forward home grown software product businesses will surely witness an increased acceptance in the domestic market thereby increasing the revenue share from domestic sales
3247310 we very strongly feel that by 2015 indian software product business revenues would be more evenly balanced between domestic and export based sales and share of revenues from the domestic market would increase from 32 per cent in fy2008 to an average of 41 per cent by fy2015 to reach 4 to 5 billion key parameters such as proximity of indian software product businesses to the local market requirements excellent understanding on localisation requirements and ease of adopting customised and targeted sales approach would fuel this growth
3247311 the people are asking with this outcome that their leaders find a way to reach an accord
3247312 we reiterate our support for bolivias unity and territorial integrity and remain committed to be a good partner in bolivias journey to a more democratic prosperous future
3247313 evo should be declared president of all the indians of this continent
3247314 there wasnt always a place to go but there was always an urgent need to belong
3247315 you cant just push them into the jungles and wait you have to search for them and completely eradicate them only then can peace come
3247316 on the face of it the government has made great strides they the tigers are really hemmed in this time
3247317 im just not sure the military progress can be translated into political progress
3247318 my wife is on edge from the moment i leave home until the moment i return
3247319 all these things need to be stopped the government needs to take action against the perpetrators
3247320 people are giving them the benefit of the doubt for now
3247321 the worry is that what seems like a passing phase might become a way of life
3247322 alone should secure his reputation forever but really if you listen to just about anything in the last quarter centurys worth of rap and r amp b you can still hear him
3247323 and i thought to myself just turn on the radio and listen to some of your hip hop stuff thats what ive done lately
3247324 the hippest edgiest track ever to win an academy award for best song
3247325 me and my wife were asleep i woke up and all the people in the bus fell to one side
3247326 i keep trying to pull my wife out and she says help me
3247327 she was stuck in the chair or something there were people on top of her it was people locked together
3247328 she knows nothing one eye is covered she has stitches on the side of her head we just prayed
3247329 next week i can go back to work i think im not sure
3247330 we are no strangers to floods to local fires its just hard
3247331 thats why im trying to give 120 percent im in it for the short term they still have a long road ahead
3247332 my stomach is growling and it wants to be feed so screw the rules that say i have to throw you back for now my fishy friend you will become a tasty snack
3247333 but a decrease of three or four really isnt relevant a lot that has to do with factors like how accurate the shooter was and how effective the emergency room treatment was three or four murders are within the margin for error
3247334 we had a 14 year old kid stabbed to death and it got a paragraph in the chronicle
3247335 i think the community feels like these things are going unnoticed ive been trying to get the mayors office to react but basically theres nobody home
3247336 youre going to let them spin this into something because i am running for election
3247337 i think it is a little better than that over 2005 2006 and 2007
3247338 more like 2 out of 5 but in comparison to other large cities our size we are not doing well
3247339 dont swell by several thousand people on a daily basis
3247340 begin a campaign to recall me and you know what i may be right there as a co signer of that effort
3247341 its going to be a very very big political football
3247342 in november we are going to have at least four new supervisors looking to cut their teeth it is the political season
3247343 is that the statistics really havent changed much in the last 10 years and weve been through a bunch of chiefs in that time what i am hoping is that these studies will show that there are other ways of doing things as well as what we are doing now that isnt working
3247344 i talk to the chief a couple of times a week
3247345 shes getting tired it wouldnt surprise me if in the fall or by the end of the year she says enoughs enough
3247346 city hall has been rife with that rumor for a long time
3247347 all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively there is no such thing as death life is only a dream and we are the imagination of ourselves
3247348 god is supreme and god is love god is the word and to that word i am yoked and that word it is given me to hear the word that is the creator that is the ringing radiance

3247350 the human form is not bestowed upon us for the enjoyment of sense pleasures but for realizing the lord and merging our souls with him
3247351 the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy
3247352 be open minded but no so open minded that your brains fall out
3247353 the aids industry and media want you to think there are only a handful of scientists who doubt
3247354 a variety of potential dangers including legal trouble public exposure and watchdog groups digging through their lives
3247355 these changes are designed to reduce the number of unnecessary consultations under the esa so that more time and resources can be devoted to the protection of the most vulnerable species
3247356 the proposed regulations will continue to protect species while focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur the result should be a process that is less time consuming and a more effective use of our resources
3247357 draw a direct causal link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts affecting species
3247358 as a result it is inappropriate to consult on a remote agency action involving the contribution of emissions to global warming because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3247359 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3247360 the new rules take decision making on endangered species listings out of the hands of scientists and wildlife professionals at agencies such as the u s fish and wildlife services and instead put those decisions in the hands of agencies working on projects that may be adversely affected by a listing
3247361 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3247362 we are trying to be more efficient which means not do consultations that result in a difference for the species
3247363 when we pursue consultation in situations where the potential effects to a species are either unlikely incapable of being meaningfully evaluated wholly beneficial or pose only a remote risk of causing jeopardy to the species or its habitat
3247364 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3247365 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3247366 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3247367 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3247368 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3247369 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3247370 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3247371 use the new darker blue ink and not the old light blue ink
3247372 i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world

3247402 il demone che legato alla tua esistenza da diversi anni a questa parte
3247403 vedi non ti mai stato rivelato ma sei un dark child
3247404 si te il gran maestro dellordine ti ha preso prima che altri ti trovassero e ha deciso di studiare a fondo la natura dei dark child lasciandoti crescere libero bench sotto il suo controllo
3247405 solo che non stato in grado di capire quando la tua anima si legata a quella di un demone non avrebbe potuto del resto ma la sua sete di conoscenza ha causato questo pasticcio un demone ha trovato un appiglio nella barriera e vi si aggrappato e quellappiglio sei tu
3247406 pasticcio barriera ma di che parlate tutto questo non ha senso
3247407 la spiegazione completa troppo lunga e il nostro tempo poco a suo tempo vi dir tutto o almeno molte cose ma ora vi basti sapere che i demoni veri e propri si trovano su un altro piano desistenza e non possono arrivare qui per via di una barriera che protegge il mondo e io controllo questa barriera quindi so di cosa parlo chiaro
3247408 pensaci non hai mai manifestato strani poteri una predilezione per alcuni incantesimi mai tetntati prima non hai mai perso la memoria di interi archi di tempo
3247409 non fargliene una colpa macchia non certo colpa sua ci che lo ha colpito n ha colpa delle azioni che in fin di vita ha compito il demone impossessandosi del suo corpo ha dovuto farlo ormai sono a un livello di simbiosi tale che se ad uno dei due succede qualcosa anche laltro ne subisce le conseguenze
3247410 vattene sono pericoloso no lho visto prima hai paura di me e hai ragione sono un demone
3247411 davon smettila non sapevo avessi questo demone dentro di te ma sapevo che cera qualcosa di strano io ho visto il mattatoio di quel vicolo quando hai sistemato i sicari mandati dallordine io lo ricordo bene come potrei dimenticarlo ma pure quando pensavo fossi stato te a fare quelle cose ti sono stato vicino c un demone legato a te e allora sono tuo amico non mi importa niente dei demoni
3247412 bene ora che vi siete nuovamente ritrovati posso riportare lattenzione sul demone che sta cercando di impossessarsi del tuo corpo condizione della quale il tuo braccio solo il principio
3247413 e impossibile tenervi separati ancora a lungo quindi dovremo fare in modo che tu sconfigga il demone ricacciandolo nel profondo del tuo animo cos da tenervelo imprigionato
3247414 certo ben poche cose sono impossibili in compenso molto pericoloso e ovviamente pu anche succedere che tu soccomba e il demone vinca
3247415 allora presto o tardi mi dovr confrontare con questo demone ma cosa cambier tra il farlo poi e il farlo adesso se me ne andassi adesso potrei vivere la mia vita finch il demone non mi sconfigger no cosa mi offre invece per affrontarlo subito aiuto
3247416 no in questa sfida non posso aiutarti ma posso fare in modo che vi affrontiate nel mio territorio cos che se anche vincesse il demone non ci sar alcun mostro con il tuo aspetto a girare per il mondo massacrando persone innocenti
3247417 pensa piuttosto a fare in modo che se perdo quella cosa non esca di l
3247418 devi ci che accadr adesso a davon non per i tuoi occhi e se tu fossi vicino a lui moriresti

3247436 i love rumors but thats exactly what this is a rumor since i have been in fargo the only sparring ive had has been with a big heavyweight from grand forks

3247457 but under the parameters we were given for the federal law we didnt have a choice
3247458 it was a tough decision for all of us because the state law and the federal law are at odds
3247459 they were armed to the hilt like we were a terrorist cell they stole all our money id rather have been done in by gangs

3247472 offensively we got off to a slow start but we picked up the pace as the half went on
3247473 63 years ago today our world was changed forever when an indiscriminate weapon was used against this city
3247474 today 63 years after that terrible day there are still 26 000 nuclear weapons pointed at cities aimed at people poised to irradiate our water and food chain and permanently impact the gene pool we must redouble our effort and eliminate these weapons
3247475 nuclear weapons are not like other weapons there is no other weapon that can kill hundreds of millions of people in a few hours and bring about the end of human civilisation
3247476 the australian greens strongly oppose the mining and export of australian uranium particularly to nuclear terror states and have a long standing record of effort in this regard
3247477 the radiation from nuclear weapons and nuclear energy is uniquely hazardous persistent and indiscriminate damaging our most precious legacy the core human blueprint stored in our dna and passed on to future generations
3247478 every nuclear power plant is a pre deployed radiological weapon waiting to be detonated by an enemy each and every nuclear power plant creates more of the materials required for nuclear weapons
3247479 that is why the australian greens work for a truly nuclear free future for our planet and for all people regardless of race colour or creed

3247520 lenovo has engineered a new breed of mobile workstation with the thinkpad w700
3247521 no other pc manufacturer has a mobile workstation that delivers the sheer power performance and cutting edge innovation that lenovo has packed into the thinkpad w700 the thinkpad w700 mobile workstation flat out delivers the command performance our customers demand at the desk as well as in the field
3247522 our engineers use lenovo thinkstation workstations to help them design the next generation williams toyota fw31 race cars aiming to make them faster and more agile with greater performance than the competition
3247523 were thrilled to see lenovo deliver the workstation performance weve come to rely on now in a mobile portable solution
3247524 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3247525 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
3247526 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3247527 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3247528 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3247529 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3247530 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3247531 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3247532 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3247533 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3247534 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3247535 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3247536 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3247537 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3247538 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3247539 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3247540 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3247541 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3247542 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3247543 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3247544 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3247545 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3247546 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3247547 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3247548 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3247549 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3247550 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3247551 maybe scottie can beam us down its an obscure reference to a canceled television show im sure youve never heard of it
3247552 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3247553 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3247554 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3247555 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3247556 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3247557 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3247558 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3247559 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3247560 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3247561 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3247562 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3247563 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3247564 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3247565 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3247566 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3247567 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3247568 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3247569 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3247570 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3247571 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3247572 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3247573 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3247574 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3247575 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3247576 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3247577 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3247578 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3247579 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3247580 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3247581 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3247582 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3247583 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3247584 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3247585 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3247586 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3247587 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3247588 we are contemplating a review of the existing draft content code as it needs to be at par with changing times
3247589 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3247590 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3247591 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3247592 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3247593 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3247594 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3247595 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3247596 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3247597 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3247598 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3247599 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3247600 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3247601 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3247602 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
3247603 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
3247604 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3247605 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3247606 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3247607 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3247608 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3247609 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3247610 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3247611 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3247612 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3247613 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3247614 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3247615 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3247616 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3247617 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3247618 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3247619 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3247620 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3247621 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3247622 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3247623 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3247624 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3247625 historically presidential nominations were decided at the party conventions and as a result the vice presidential running mates were also selected at the conventions gallups jeff jones notes
3247626 that made it difficult to disentangle the effect of naming a vice presidential running mate on a candidates support from the
3247627 the small window of time after the announcement of a presidential candidates running mate but before the convention has taken place
3247628 similar to the pattern seen with clinton in 1996 support for gore held steady during bushs vice presidential selection phase at 41 percent
3247629 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3247630 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3247631 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3247632 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3247633 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3247634 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3247635 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3247636 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3247637 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3247638 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3247639 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3247640 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3247641 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3247642 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3247643 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3247644 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3247645 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3247646 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3247647 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3247648 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3247649 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3247650 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3247651 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3247652 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3247653 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3247654 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3247655 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3247656 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3247657 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3247658 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3247659 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3247660 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3247661 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3247662 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3247663 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3247664 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3247665 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3247666 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3247667 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3247668 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3247669 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3247670 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3247671 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3247672 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3247673 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3247674 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3247675 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3247676 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3247677 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3247678 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3247679 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3247680 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3247681 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3247682 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3247683 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3247684 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3247685 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3247686 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3247687 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
3247688 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
3247689 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
3247690 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
3247691 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
3247692 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
3247693 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
3247694 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
3247695 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
3247696 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
3247697 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
3247698 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3247699 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3247700 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3247701 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3247702 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3247703 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3247704 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3247705 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3247706 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3247707 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3247708 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3247709 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3247710 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3247711 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3247712 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3247713 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3247714 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3247715 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3247716 transforming non governmental organization microfinance institutions critical ownership issues to consider
3247717 as there is a 20 percent rise in overall costs thanks to crar increase we are heading towards an increase in our interest rates too it is also leading to commercialisation of microfinance which again makes it an expensive exercise and leads to higher rates
3247718 when we need 15 percent more funds than we have the option is to double investments as well as do off balance sheet transaction or selling parts of our portfolio to banks
3247719 normally for companies which are into risky lending it is always good to have higher capital adequacy however mfis are not into such risky business and their loans are generally very small hence mfis increasing from the current 10 to 12 percent might be more adequate than 15 percent
3247720 they mfis can take the blow for another six seven months hoping that things will improve after that
3247721 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
3247722 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
3247723 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
3247724 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
3247725 i called them because i thought it was a mistake
3247726 the difference is i cant pay the rent now with what i earn
3247727 has been forthcoming and transparent about our rent increases all of which were legal and in compliance with east palo altos rent control ordinance
3247728 this book is well written and highly recommended for students and professionals in engineering computer science mathematics and related fields
3247729 300 e tamb m brinca com o homem aranha 3 motoqueiro fantasma transformers e shrek 3
3247730 empire of debt the rise of an epic financial crisis
3247731 the honest truth is that we have too many people in washington living for today rather than saving for tomorrow
3247732 give americans a good talking to about the countrys sloppy debt habits
3247733 the american people are a lot smarter than people give them credit for
3247734 comment by bruce in miami august 8 2008 at 9 54 am
3247735 if a wall streeter is selling you dont want to be buying end of story
3247736 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3247737 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3247738 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3247739 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3247740 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3247741 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3247742 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3247743 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3247744 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3247745 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3247746 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3247747 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3247748 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3247749 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3247750 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3247751 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3247752 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3247753 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3247754 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3247755 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3247756 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3247757 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3247758 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3247759 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3247760 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3247761 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor

3247763 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3247764 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done

3247769 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3247770 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3247771 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3247772 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3247773 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm

3247783 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3247784 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3247785 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3247786 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm

3247788 it is easy to write books that address broad topics and ideas leaving the reader with the question yes but how by combining a comprehensive guide to data preparation for data mining along with specific examples in sas mamdouhs book is a rare finda blend of theory and the practical at the same time as anyone who has mined data will confess 80 of the problem is in data preparation mamdouh addresses this difficult subject with strong practical techniques and methods if you are working on an sas data mining project this book is a must if you are working on any data mining project the techniques and methods will be a guiding light

3247797 brussel is een draaischijf in europa de luchthaven krijgt niet alleen veel reizigers uit belgi maar ook uit frankrijk duitsland en nederland vooral sinds de invoering van die ecotaks op vluchten daar vliegen er steeds meer nederlanders vanaf zaventem het behoeft weinig uitleg dat het achterna brengen van bagage aan buitenlandse reizigers honderden euros per passagier kost
3247798 we verwerken per dag de bagage van zowat 25 000 passagiers en in de luchtvaart lopen de kosten heel snel op
3247799 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3247800 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3247801 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3247802 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now

3247809 i just you know i really i just wanted that medal so badly
3247810 i feel even though my brother says i havent i feel like ive let people down
3247811 but he said yesterday that he can see why ive stayed in it so long the camaraderie we make friends with these people i see them so much two of the people i competed with i got to meet their kids and theyre now 19 and 22 and they got to meet my niece sarah now 19 theres a lot of caring that goes on amongst us
3247812 i love the challenge of it i love the feeling when everything goes well and absolutely the worst feeling in the world is when it all falls apart like my last round
3247813 i think i hit the first bird clay pigeon missed the second one
3247814 i thought fine i did that before i did this calming technique i use and all that and you know what it just didnt work i sort of never really got into a good rhythm
3247815 you know when you miss a few and the thing is ive been in this sport so long i knew you miss two and youll probably still be in the final
3247816 its a sort of panic and you think oh shit am i ever going to hit another bird
3247817 now that its been how long after ive done it i think thats what happened i keep forgetting to keep my eyes calm and then my body tries to catch up
3247818 but i take it year by year and i want to shoot 2009 because then i will have competed for canada at the world level for 40 years its pretty cool
3247819 i didnt think id be at this olympics now my teammates and my brother sort of think i might be around but who knows its hard because unlike the young pups i have a job and have to work for a time
3247820 i always joke that im always glad ian millar the equestrian is on the team because hes four years older
3247821 and ian was 57 when he decided to come to these games so who knows
3247822 i guess ill be like former skater kurt browning and win all these world championships and never win an olympic medal
3247823 coach lori sippel said to us before the game get em bloody type of thing
3247824 we went up there swinging that was our mentality for today
3247825 its just a totally different team in every single way possible
3247826 we knew we wanted to come out swinging today and put a lot of runs up if it comes down to runs for and runs against at the end of round robin portion of the eight country tournament we want to be on the right side of those runs four
3247827 it allowed me to fight through what i was fighting through
3247828 it allows you to completely relax and focus on what you need to do without the pressure that one run might be the ball game
3247829 chinese taipei was scrappy they did a good job on some good pitches fouling them off id throw a good pitch and theyd just get a piece and the at bat would go on and on and on it was really fun to be part of some of those at bats

3247844 tech toys and tools whats new and whats really useful
3247845 i think the selection process has worked changing the way we picked this team is going to make a difference
3247846 the way i look at it anybody can get on this team
3247847 ill look beyond friendship and try to do whats right
3247848 ill reach out to the players who are the most confident and playing the best
3247849 will take the underdog role for the first time in a long time the pressure will be on them a little more than us were playing on our soil but for the first time in a long time they have everything to lose we lost the best player in the game and were all going to have to step up
3247850 i hate that hes not going to be hanging out with us that week id like to pound him in ping pong
3247851 i dont see any positives in not having tiger woods on the team it puts us in a difficult spot
3247852 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3247853 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3247854 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3247855 does everybody have to run the a 11 no but is it here to stay absolutely
3247856 the game over the next 10 20 years isnt going to become slower and more confined the game is going to become faster and more spread out
3247857 for everybody whos saying this offense is no good for the game
3247858 why dont they ask our kids or the thousands of other kids who are going to play this offense this season and see how much fun it is
3247859 were doing football where every play is innovative and thats why people find it fun to watch its fun to play every player has the potential to be a part of almost every play
3247860 you felt it early there were some strange plays and it turned into back and forth
3247861 we didnt pitch well enough from the beginning plain and simple
3247862 i think the guys have shown a tremendous ability to stay focused but tonight there were some things that should have been handled a little better than they were
3247863 i gave up four runs in the first inning thats unacceptable
3247864 she definitely wont be allowed out before the end of the olympics
3247865 sprint recently launched sprint web a new approach to mobile browsing that works with all palm os phones on the sprint network including
3247866 i felt so good pulling on the costume for the first time so confident and in control i really felt like an action heroine
3247867 i think we finished watching it before we got out of new jersey
3247868 its just one of the games that needs to be swept under the rug i think guys are now going to come in with a mentality that tonight is a critical game for us
3247869 its a great opportunity for us to bounce back and put sundays game away
3247870 is going to be a big test for us and we have to come out stronger concentrate and not make the same mistakes
3247871 right after the game in the locker room we were saying how we have to put it behind us
3247872 to come off the terrible month that we had in cincinnati and you get a phone call today saying youre being traded to a first place team as a player thats all you could ask for

3247877 the chinese are too strong and the only opportunity for us is to wait for them to make a mistake
3247878 i am confident of bringing back two gold medals at the games
3247879 i will work hard on every dive instead of caring too much about results
3247880 we thought it was going to be really difficult and people were very nervous for the first few days but once we realised the police were not going to touch us everyone flooded in
3247881 touch wood we have not had any trouble from the police
3247882 i sold an opening ceremony ticket i won in the lottery for 800 yuan for 7 000

3247884 you have the chance to see the hero of china trying to cope with a lifetime of pressure on him

3247898 if god created everything then god created evil and since evil exists amp according to the principle that our works define who we are then we can assume god is evil
3247899 what kind of question is this of course it exists have you never been cold
3247900 in fact sir cold does not exist according to the laws of physics what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy amp heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy absolute zero 460f is the total absence of heat amp all matter becomes inert amp incapable of reaction at that temperature cold does not exist we have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat
3247901 once again you are wrong sir darkness does not exist either darkness is in reality the absence of light light we can study but not darkness in fact we can use newtons prism to break white light into many colors amp study the various wave lengths of each color you cannot measure darkness a simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness amp illuminate it how can you know how dark a certain space is you measure the amount of light present isnt this correct darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present
3247902 of course as i have already said we see it everyday it is in the daily examples of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime amp violence everywhere in the world these manifestations are nothing else but evil
3247903 evil does not exist sir or at least it does not exist unto itself evil is simply the absence of god it is just like darkness amp cold a word that man has created to describe the absence of god god did not create evil evil is the result of what happens when man does not have gods love present in his heart its like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light
3247904 the scheme will have very low in use and embodied carbon emissions compared to almost any other multi unit residential project completed in the uk to date
3247905 three gardens aims to achieve an eco homes excellent rating as well as being a first rate example of cost effective design
3247906 these measures together with the biomass boiler fired community heating system will help the development reduce carbon emissions by around 60 compared to a standard regulations compliant building
3247907 i am absolutely delighted the green credentials really appeal to us because as a family we do try to be environmentally friendly
3247908 easy safe and accessible support seems to be seriously diminished with the prospect of downgrading the services of the scbu at the hospital
3247909 a further concern is the additional anxiety produced in parents of seriously ill babies as a result of the additional time and cost of travel and reduced contact time with their infants certainly this anxiety is not insignificant and the possibility of transfer of the parents stress to an already ill offspring must be taken into account
3247910 it is difficult to appreciate how downgrading such a vital and high class service would be beneficial and we therefore urge you to consider fully the effects on young families the wisdom of your decision will be borne out in the future success of the nhs in this area for years to come

3247912 a lot of people say the church is an ugly building and something should be done with it but the worry is that the building also doubles as a hall which can be used by other groups
3247913 stowmarket has never had a town hall and personally i feel we need something other than shops and houses in the town we need a town hall or a public building
3247914 a town of our size which already has thousands of people and is growing should have this and this is a golden opportunity to provide such a venue
3247915 i dont think you want a public building in the primary retail area it does not need to be there
3247916 zanu pf is not talking about conceding any real power they are talking about giving up positions in cabinet but they want to remain in control these guys arent serious
3247917 the differences revolve around who will have power theyre not giving up anything on that they entered these negotiations solely to give up cosmetic issues
3247918 there is a lot of pressure on tsvangirai people in the party are telling him that he cannot agree to a deal that does not recognise the peoples will and democracy mugabe should not be allowed to keep power just because he terrorised the population into voting for him
3247919 the pressure for us is coming from the people they dont want to see some kind of half hearted change if we were to do that we would lose credibility if morgan takes something cosmetic from zanu pf he will lose the support of the zimbabwean people
3247920 the georgians must agree to sign agreements on the non use of force with the ossetians and with the abkhazians
3247921 ceasefire agreement is signed by two sides when they meet
3247922 georgian people will never surrender freedom and democracy because democracy is stronger than any of their tanks any of their bombings any of their brutal equipment
3247923 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3247924 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3247931 when the project was conceptualized it was conceptualized with a subsidy
3247932 you cant do any of this stuff without a subsidy none of it makes sense
3247933 there was a commitment when steve leeper was the sports amp exhibition authority director that there would be no additional taxpayer money used in the development between the stadiums somebody has decided to change that rule thats not surprising given everything thats happened in the past year on this land
3247934 given that they were able to purchase the land at one fifteenth of its value at some point we have to question why all the benefits are being given to one developer for one piece of land
3247935 right now the land is sitting there it is generating zero revenue except parking revenue for the sports amp exhibition authority the steelers will buy the land at a value determined six years ago they will put up an entertainment facility that will pay sales tax back to the state liquor taxes back to the state real estate taxes back to the city county and school district and income taxes back to the city and the state
3247936 the sum total of that will be an excellent return back to the state
3247937 i think in the next few months we will further see a slowdown in inflation
3247938 producer price figures showed costs pressures remained quite big while consumer price figures showed price rises on the consumption side have eased
3247939 what is especially encouraging is that the price hike on oil products prices in june did not change the declining trend of the inflation
3247940 the economic damage is regrettable for a country that has worked hard in recent years to improve the economic well being of its population
3247941 foreign investors who have played a key role in the countrys good performance could be scared off
3247942 its confidence in the countrys strong economic fundamentals at this extremely critical time for georgia
3247943 strong economic fundamentals including ample foreign reserves prudent monetary and fiscal policy and wide ranging financial sector reforms that has lead to a strengthened banking sector that today is both liquid and solvent
3247944 higher arms spending than planned can also endanger the governments budgetary consolidation objectives
3247945 through its substantial military operations russia also sees an opportunity to show that the region is not sound for future pipelines
3247946 to pass a strong resolution getting the russians to show some restraint
3247947 is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint
3247948 to immediately and unconditionally withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory

3247964 because youre so close you have no choice but to feel a part of it
3247965 because when you think of opera you think big but we do it small its intimate and its sexy
3247966 intended for a small setting whose intimacy is mirrored in the economy of means employed both musically and theatrically
3247967 the power of the music is concentrated and the audience is directly involved
3247968 because youre so close you have no choice but to feel a part of it its really visceral
3247969 we are the only company that exclusively presents work intended for intimate venues
3247970 we hone to our mission we dont take things made for bigger spaces and cut them down that gives us a huge wide berth of repertoire that no one else is doing
3247971 a lot of audience members say theyre not opera people
3247972 and i say i hate to tell you this but you are because thats what were doing
3247973 so much beauty of sound and intensity of projection brought opening nights largely uptown opera jaded audience to its feet and sent me out into wherever i was impatient to hear what else this intrepid little company has up its sleeve
3247974 i dont think weve ever had what you could call a traditional staging
3247975 i want them to look like their characters you cant have a 45 year old play a 20 year old in a small space you cant fudge it a lot
3247976 what i want to do is get people really turned on to the arts and to go out and explore
3247977 why dont you let me tell you whats going on
3247978 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3247979 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3247980 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3247981 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3247982 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3247983 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3247984 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3247985 if we break the vat chain we will lose all the revenues if we really have to replace the vat with an excise tax we suggest that the excess tax will maintain the revenues of tax
3247986 shifting the form of taxation on crude oil and petroleum products from vat to excise tax
3247987 vat is a progressive tax it will benefit lower income groups while higher income groups who purchase luxury items will pay higher taxes it is better to collect the tax and allocate the proceeds to direct transfers to the poor
3247988 i cannot understand why there is an increasing vat collection but decreasing budget for social services where did the other vat collections go
3247989 non lifeline consumers pay for both the vat and discount of lifeline consumers
3247990 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3247991 meh its still at least another 10 hours on a plane more airport food and at least 1 missed delayed canceled flight until i get to my destination
3247992 what next top 10 top 10 lists of top 10 lists
3247993 if this issue is as serious as it appears to be then we can solve it
3247994 but we cant solve it by being paralysed by all these parochial views
3247995 whats happening is that people who like natural gas over promote natural gas and overly criticise all the other ones
3247996 the people who like ethanol overly promote ethanol and overly criticise all the other ones
3247997 the next thing you know youve got all these people digging their heels in thinking theres a single answer and thats the only thing you should invest in

3248021 hes just one of those kids you want to embrace and you love to see successfully because hes done such a great thing for swimming in our community
3248022 he does some things in practice that are just phenomenal
3248023 but he doesnt do thousands of yards to do it he just does what he needs to and when it comes to a super big important swim he can do it like he did last night

3248034 i think in the next few months we will further see a slowdown in inflation
3248035 producer price figures showed costs pressures remained quite big while consumer price figures showed price rises on the consumption side have eased
3248036 what is especially encouraging is that the price hike on oil products prices in june did not change the declining trend of the inflation

3248044 michigan is either the weakest or second weakest economy mostly due to the misfortunes of the auto industry
3248045 aside from michigan the rest of the midwest is generally struggling with weakness in the auto sector and other consumer durable goods

3248050 the authors dissect and demystify prevalent job search and career concerns with in depth analysis and cutting edge recommendations including demonstrating the role personal branding plays in career success
3248051 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last three to six years that has had an impact
3248052 pretty much every employer has to do something or is doing something in an effort to bring that number down
3248053 we have a speculative bubble in prices thats giving way to what now i think are more moderate levels
3248054 i think we can look forward to a resumption of an improvement in equity prices based on still good earnings coming out of many companies
3248055 what we do isnt based on financial fads or market situations but rather on what we believe is the right thing to do
3248056 i think its about time the banking industry started to stand up and say were not all subprime lenders
3248057 i think that is what some of the banks like bb amp t and first citizens are trying to accomplish in their ads
3248058 we know a lot of consumers look to these rating services when deciding on a financial institution
3248059 given all that was going on in the industry we really felt it was time to reassure our clients our shareholders our employees and the community that bb amp t is a very sound very stable well respected bank
3248060 we have already been seeing attacks in the wild for the past two weeks

3248067 i had to force myself to put it out of my head
3248068 the international society should immediately get involved and demand that china stop the repression
3248069 at a news conference tuesday county chief yusufujiang maimaiti said
3248070 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3248071 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3248072 if you look at the streets everything seems calm and peaceful
3248073 but behind it all the situation is different people are really angry
3248074 if you are a muslim you are already a criminal suspect in the eyes of the chinese

3248087 apple inc designs manufactures and sells personal computers portable digital music players and mobile communication devices as well as related software services peripherals and networking solutions worldwide
3248088 sure apple could still achieve its success without the internet but all their current products mainly revolve around it
3248089 if a crappy vanilla box had internet osx could succeed on a different level
3248090 what makes apple is a combination of many helping hands but if you boil them down into a few simple components
3248091 its an every 28 day thing it comes unwanted yet you need it so
3248092 thanks to the work of production designer anton furst batman is fun to look at at least for a while yet nothing in the movie sustains this vision the wit is all pictorial the film meanders mindlessly from one image to the next as does a comic book
3248093 mostly though batman is a movie without any dominant tone or style other than that provided by mr furst its neither funny nor solemn it has the personality not of a particular movie but of a product of something arrived at by corporate decision
3248094 so intensely does mr burton render his villains tender psyches in fact that the upright hero bruce wayne a k a batman michael keaton is easily overlooked amid all the toys and troublemakers that surround him this batman with motives and magical powers that are never made interesting is at best a cipher and at worst a black hole the blandness of batman through no fault of mr keaton who plays the character with appropriate earnestness is symptomatic of this materials main shortcoming almost nothing about it makes sense or particularly matters primarily a visual artist mr burton is often casual about plot considerations which means that audiences watching his films are set adrift as if in dreams and the characters thoughts and motives are half forgotten before the film is over costumes attitudes gadgets and the great ingenuity of bo welchs dazzling production design will linger in the mind long after the actual story of batman returns becomes a blur
3248095 serious audiences will be less interested than ever in whats under batmans cape or cowl theres not much to contemplate here beyond the spectacle of gimmicky props and the kitsch of good actors all of whom have lately done better work elsewhere dressed for a red hot halloween
3248096 aiming for comic book fans with a taste for heavy sarcasm and double entendres the lavish batman and robin cares only about delivering nonstop glitter in the interests of this it is more than happy to steamroll over questions of character and plotting theres not much more to batman now played affably but blandly by george clooney and given only second billing than a heroic jaw line understanding gaze and anatomically correct rubber suit the mixed up melancholy batman of tim burtons first two films looks like the brooding prince of denmark next to this
3248097 conceived in the shadow of american pop rather than in its bright light this tense effective iteration of bob kanes original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director who takes his material seriously and to a star who shoulders that seriousness with ease
3248098 its amazing what an excellent cast a solid screenplay and a regard for the source material can do for a comic book movie mr
3248099 that struggle gives the story its requisite heft but what makes this batman so enjoyable is how mr nolan balances the storys dark elements with its light and arranges the familiar genre elements in new unforeseen ways what makes batman begins the most successful comic book adaptation alongside terry zwigoffs ghost world isnt the noisy set pieces the nods to blade runner or the way a childs keepsake an indian arrowhead echoes the shape of a bat its the way mr nolan invites us to watch bruce wayne quietly piecing together his batman identity to become a secret sharer to a legend just as we did once upon a time when we read our first comic
3248100 anyone who knows me will tell you that i would never read a comic book
3248101 burtons batman movies have no sequel even the second one is not a sequel for the first
3248102 the film meanders mindlessly from one image to the next
3248103 its such a shame youve lost the will to fight you fought so hard previously when nothing materialised and all this needs is a little push
3248104 im so tired of fighting for someone i just want to be fought for
3248105 if you want to do big things in the world then show up and stand for something
3248106 that provides the strategies and tactics for successful entrepreneurship and allows you to stand for something make money and do it your way listen as michael is interviewed by
3248107 the focus of this position is to oversee the translation of the design approach of the print publication to the web
3248108 heb je de opleiding gekozen naar aanleiding van iets dat je op het internet hebt gezien
3248109 eigelijk wel ja ik heb op internet wat rondgekeken en daarna heb ik informatie opgevraagd en heb ik de opendag bezocht maar het is niet zo dat ik met alleen de informatie van internet deze opleiding zou hebben gekozen
3248110 is de opleiding wat je ervan hebt verwacht naar aanleiding van wat je op internet hebt gelezen
3248111 op zich komt het wel redelijk overeen alleen de vakken m amp o projectvaardigheden enz had ik niet echt verwacht nu ben ik wel blij dat ik deze vakken heb want ik denk dat dit in de toekomst heel erg belangrijk is
3248112 zoals je eerder al zei heb je niet alleen gebruik gemaakt van het internet wil je hiermee zeggen dat er op het internet te weinig informatie staat
3248113 nee op het internet staat genoeg basisinformatie het zou een beetje raar zijn als alle informatie op het internet stond dat is veel te veel om van een scherm af te lezen je krijgt met de informatie van het internet een goede eerste indruk om te kijken of het nodig is om verdere informatie op te vragen of dat de opleiding sowieso niets voor jou is en te gaan zoeken naar iets anders
3248114 dus voor jou hoeft er verder niets aan de site te veranderen
3248115 je hebt voor de studie bedrijfscommunicatie gekozen onder andere naar aanleiding van
3248116 ja ik heb niet op internet gekeken bij verschillende opleidingen bedrijfscommunicatie leek me wel wat voor mij dus heb ik verdere informatie opgevraagd
3248117 nu je hier studeert heb je ook te maken met het intranet van deze school kun je zeggen wat je hier over het algemeen van vind
3248118 over sharepoint ben ik niet echt positief ik ben vaak erg lang bezig naar het zoeken van informatie verder is het vaak niet actueel en erg onoverzichtelijk hier zou nog best wat aan veranderd kunnen worden
3248119 you think anyone will judge me if i use that bag to work ah

3248125 this element of your personal brand is influenced by what you say about others your honesty and sincerity the other people you associate with and the things you are willing to do to service a clients needs or support a colleague
3248126 your personal brand has got to be palatable too much self promotion too little focus on bringing something valuable to the table and you could find yourself getting discarded like burnt toast

3248129 kata pegawai di bahagian konsulat kedutaan jepun sebentar tadi saya keletihan bagai mahu terduduk setelah satu demi satu surat diserahkan berserta tambahan masuk beberapa ribu ringgit ke dalam akaun seperti yang diarahkan akhirnya semua dokumen selesai saya kemukakan penerbangan ke tokyo narita dijadualkan malam ini namun hanya tinggal beberapa jam sebelum penerbangan saya masih belum memperolehi visa terkenang kembali bagaimana berkali kali saya membatalkan perjalanan ke mesir semasa belajar di jordan disebabkan oleh kerenah visa begitu juga dengan birokrasi imigresen dan kastam di lapangan lapangan terbang seluruh dunia pasca september 11 2001 semuanya amat meletihkan lalu saya memaksa diri untuk bertanya apakah berbaloi semua ini sukar sekali untuk saya menjawab soalan seperti ini kerana saya tidak pernah mengukur atau peduli untuk mengukurnya maka saya tidak tahu apakah program program yang saya kendalikan di uk ireland australia indonesia dan mungkin kali ini jepun apakah semua ini berbaloi mungkin bagi sesetengah orang lain mereka menanti nanti peluang untuk ke luar negara tetapi tidak saya setiap perjalanan dilakukan dengan penuh mujahadah keseronokan hanya ada pada peluang menyampaikan kebaikan kepada peserta tetapi tidak pada perjalanan dan peluang berada di luar negara semenjak bertahun tahun saya bisa sahaja tidur di dalam pesawat sebelum pesawat meninggalkan bangunan terminal lagi bosan dengan perjalanan bebanan itu menjadi lebih kritikal apabila mengenangkan isteri dan anak anak yang ditinggalkan susah payah ummu saif menjaga anak anak tanpa saya rindu anak anak saya pula tidak terkata pernah sewaktu saya pulang dari kuching tempoh hari saya tiba di rumah lewat malam semua orang telah tidur oleh kerana esoknya saya perlu memberikan sebuah ceramah maka dalam keletihan saya gagahkan diri berjaga malam untuk menyiapkan bahan tiba tiba naurah terjaga dari tidur dia sungguh terkejut melihat saya hingga buntu untuk memberikan reaksi selepas kebingungan beberapa saat dia menangis menangis dan kemudian memeluk saya tanpa bicara rindu seorang anak yang ditinggalkan oleh seorang bapa yang pergi mendidik anak anak orang lain itu hanya secebis dari coretan di balik tabir semua program yang saya kendalikan lalu saya harus bertanya berbaloikah semua ini berbaloikah segala birokrasi imigresen belanja besar penganjur susah payah saya untuk apa semua ini soalan ini jadi lebih menyakitkan apabila di dalam sebuah program baru baru ini beberapa orang pelajar yang menjadi peserta program kendalian saya telah dengan tanpa segan silu membaca surat khabar semasa saya berceramah terkenangkan isteri dan anak anak yang menangis melepaskan saya pergi tersirap darah dan mahu sahaja saya tempeleng kebiadaban mereka ini saya lebih rela berceramah kepada 10 orang peserta daripada melihat 100 peserta yang datang ke program yang tiada siapa memaksanya kemudian menjatuhkan semangat penceramah dengan kelakuan biadab sebegitu itu belum dikira beberapa program sebelum ini apabila pihak sekolah membiarkan saya sendirian berceramah sambil mengawal 400 orang pelajar di dewan besar sambil saya berceramah pelajar membaling kertas ke kepala kawan kawan membuat lawak bodoh dan menyampuk percakapan saya uff terlintasnya wajah isteri dan anak anak sungguh memanaskan hati saya tatkala berdepan dengan situasi sebegitu memikirkan soal keluarga kerja pengajian tanggungjawab yang pelbagai saya mengharapkankepada semua pihak yang sudah mengadakan perbincangan dengan saya agar dapat mempertimbangkan semula sejauh manakah perlunya kita semua kepada segalanya ini saya ingin mendapatkan maklum balas rakan di seluruh dunia tentang hal ini sebagai alternatif mengapa tidak dirancang dan diadakan sahaja program di malaysia pada musim cuti saya yakin idea di luar kotak ini mungkin boleh dipraktikkan ia lebih menjimatkan lebih menggalakkan pelajar memanfaatkan cuti mereka di malaysia dan saya boleh meninggalkan rumah dalam keadaan yang lebih sederhana sabotaj jamaah centrik tekanan menjadi lebih menyakitkan apabila beberapa kali program kendalian saya sama ada di dalam negara atau di luar negara cuba disabotaj oleh beberapa kumpulan islam mereka dengan sengaja mengadakan program mengejut pada tarikh berlangsungnya program saya demi melarikan peserta walhal saya tidak pernah mempunyai sebarang agenda untuk mengumpul pengikut mengapa harus takut sesiapa sahaja bebas datang ke program saya tanpa mengira fikrah dan kefahaman politik mereka saya sentiasa menyampaikan perkara perkara yang boleh dimanfaatkan oleh sesiapa sahaja yang mahukan kebaikan datanglah ke program saya kemudian pulanglah ke kem masing masing saya tiada pengikut tetapi entah mengapa pemikiran jumud sesetengah golongan yang menisbahkan diri mereka kepada dakwah sangat takut untuk membuka ruang wacana yang sememangnya sudah sedia terbuka di era globalisasi ini takut dengan bayang bayang sendiri barangkali malah program saya tiada dressing code tiada sebarang pre judgement dan tiada apa apa yang bias bahan perkongsian saya luas seluas islam hanya yang sempit jiwa dan fikiran saya hidup dalam ketakutan program saya bertujuan membantu manusia mencari dan menghargai kebenaran bukan mengelompokkan manusia atas nama agama sabotaj mereka sungguh menjelekkan saya summer camp ipij 2008 saya terharu dengan persiapan yang begitu bersungguh sungguh ditunjukkan oleh mahasiswa i di jepun untuk program kali ini mereka telah melamar saya seawal ogos 2007 dan persiapan telah diatur begitu rapi tetapi kesilapan saya ialah saya tidak menjangkakan bahawa urusan visa ke sebuah negara maju seperti jepun menjadi begitu rumit lantas seminggu terakhir ini amat memeritkan masih ada dua jam lagi sebelum keputusan visa saya diluluskan atau sebaliknya semoga hari ini ada kemudahan selepas kesusahan ameen erti hidup pada memberi perkongsian anda biar pun hanya secawan kopi amat bermakna dalam usaha menampung

3248130 it is realized that the league is incapable of rendering material aid and that the moral influence which may be a powerful force with civilized countries is unlikely to make any impression upon soviet russia
3248131 while america considers georgia its strongest ally in the bloc of former soviet countries washington needs russia too much on big issues like iran to risk it all to defend georgia

3248133 now the story goes russia has at last found a way of undermining georgias western aspirations nipping the countrys budding democracy and countering american influence across eurasia but this view of events
3248134 the war began as an ill considered move by georgia to retake south ossetia by force
3248135 like the balkans in the 1990s the central problems of this region are about the dark politics of ethnic revival and territorial struggle the region is home to scores of brewing border disputes and dreams of nationalist homelands
3248136 will the book end up in the center of one massively interconnected cluster

3248138 the john bull character was that of a drinking man hard headed down to earth averse to intellectualism fond of dogs horses ale and country sports during the napoleonic wars john bull became the national symbol of freedom of loyalty to king and country and of resistance to french aggression he was the ordinary man in the street who would fight napoleon with his bare hands if necessary by the 1800s he was seen as a more assertive figure in domestic politics as well prepared to criticise the royal family and the government giving those outside the traditional political process a voice john bull became so familiar that his name frequently appeared in books plays periodical titles and as a brand name or trademark although frequently used through world war ii john bull has been seen less often since the 1950s as uncle sam is the iconic representation of the united states so john bull is the personification of the character of the english honest generous straightforward with a zest for life and ready to stand up and fight for what he believes in

3248183 as the federation of caucasian associations we stress that south ossetia and abkhazia are not breakaway regions they are independent republics their invasion by georgia cannot be accepted just as no invasion in the world can decisions of independence by the people of these countries cannot be rendered null and void through wars south ossetia is currently under invasion by georgia babies are heartlessly being killed there and innocent mothers fathers and the elderly are being lynched
3248184 we want turkey and the rest of the world to recognize these two countries independence as they did for kosovo we call on international democracy and human rights organizations to call for an end to the barbarity in south ossetia

3248189 in the first meditation i set forth the reasons for which we may generally speaking doubt about all things and especially about material things at least so long as we have no other foundations for the sciences than those which we have hitherto possessed but although the utility of a doubt which is so general does not at first appear it is at the same time very great inasmuch as it delivers us from every kind of prejudice and sets out for us a very simple way by which the mind may detach itself from the senses and finally it makes it impossible for us ever to doubt those things which we have once discovered to be true

3248199 wahai yang mulia ketua rombongan ini tidak mengatakan pendapatnya melainkan tengah menuturkan kenyataan yang sebenarnya
3248200 yang mulia kami berpendapat bahwa untuk masalah ini para ilmuwan harus membahasnya secara ilmiah sehingga dapat menjelaskan berdasarkan kebenaran yang terjadi
3248201 hingga apabila dia telah sampai ketempat terbit matahari sebelah timur dia mendapati matahari itu menyinari segolongan umat yang kami tidak menjadikannya bagi mereka sesuatu yamg melindunginya dari cahaya matahari itu
3248202 we typically make fun of bungled police operations by saying they were conducted by the gang that couldnt shoot straight
3248203 in this case they could shoot straight as a result they killed a familys two dogs in the midst of a misguided drug raid
3248204 rather than carefully checking the facts including talking to the local police department the county authorities acted rashly illustrating how the drug war threatens the liberties of all americans
3248205 absent exigent circumstances not present here so called no knock raids are an affront to the constitution
3248206 so is a shoot first ask questions later philosophy by the police yet the prince georges police have done this before last fall they invaded a house at the wrong address and shot the family dog all americans are at risk when the police behave this way just ask yourself what might happen if a suspicious package is delivered to your home and the cops bust in
3248207 but there is an even larger point law enforcement agencies have become more arrogant and less accountable in cases other than those involving drugs most people are aware of well publicized examples like waco and ruby ridge but similar abuses are common across the country though they usually receive little or no public notice
3248208 we all want police to do their jobs well but part of doing their job well is respecting the peoples constitutional liberties
3248209 as president i will ensure that federal law enforcement agencies set a good example for the rest of the country
3248210 in a barr administration government officials will never forget that it is a free people they are protecting
3248211 airline fares are rocketing upward along with higher fuel prices
3248212 and so are government taxes yet even if you cancel the ticket you still get stuck with the tax and if you change your flight you get hit again
3248213 anyone who looks at the cost breakdown when they buy a ticket will see a federal excise tax a security fee and airport charges they make even a cheap ticket expensive for many families
3248214 and its not obvious that we get good value for our money ask yourself how safe you feel the next time you are standing in an airport security line and the tsa employees confiscate someones bottle of water
3248215 even more outrageous though the government keeps your money even if you change your ticket
3248216 at least the airlines give you credit minus a hefty change fee of course but the federal government just pockets the money when asked about this unfair practice government employees say thats just the way the regulations are written regulations that they of course wrote
3248217 the airport taxes might be small change compared to the federal income tax but they exemplify how the government cares more about collecting money than treating taxpayers fairly that will change in a barr administration
3248218 one of the priorities of my administration will be to sharply cut and significantly simplify federal taxes we pay too much and spend too much time figuring out how much we have to pay that needs to change
3248219 lowering and simplifying taxes will make all of us better off and make our country both freer and more prosperous
3248220 i will also ensure that the american people stop paying taxes on services that they dont receive like airline travel we dont let businesses get away with charging us for services that they dont perform we should hold government to the same standard as president barr will do
3248221 my apology to ralph nader for not demanding that he be included in the debates

3248223 this is a fantastic opportunity and i look forward to embracing laras world
3248224 its unbelievable how realistic her movements are in tomb raider underworld and its so gratifying to be able to use my years of gymnastic training to portray such a beloved character
3248225 with her tremendous athletic ability and striking look we feel alison embodies the spirit and strength of lara croft
3248226 were excited to be working with her for the launch of tomb raider underworld and beyond and cant wait to see the reactions of tomb raider fans around the world to alisons uncannily realistic portrayal of lara
3248227 both the mccain and obama energy plans privilege corporate profits over the urgent need to transforms our nations energy policies both mr mccain and mr obama are seeking ways to preserve corporate profits at a time when the future of our planet is at stake
3248228 barack obamas support for nuclear power and ethanol and his recent turnaround on offshore drilling prove that he like john mccain will not challenge the power and profits of the energy industry we need the kind of national leadership on energy and the global warming threat thats represented by our presidential and congressional green candidates
3248229 drilling in anwr would have little discernible impact on actual global oil supplies as its advocates well know the argument that it could nonetheless bring down oil prices is based not on hard economics but on market psychoanalysis drilling would send a message to the oil traders that more oil is on the way which would cause them to start betting down the price
3248230 americas first energy priorities must be conservation and efficiency the green party has an effective plan to reorganize the economy create millions of new jobs in conversion to safe clean energy conservation and expansion of public transportation to replace car traffic
3248231 such an effort should be comparable to americas concerted and internationally cooperative effort to defeat the axis powers during world war ii but this time wed be uniting for peace since global warming threatens the security of the entire world in the coming decades
3248232 without such an effort the disaster we witnessed in new orleans during and after katrina will take place on a global scale billions of people will see their homes livelihoods health and lives threatened while corporate interests exploit the devastation for more money and power

3248246 what weve lost primarily is a reporter who cast a cynical eye on the best laid plans of bureaucrats who took the same level of skepticism to his coverage of both political parties and who was motivated above all by the desire to unearth information that powerful people would prefer remain buried
3248247 to the detriment of the republic there is now one fewer skeptic calling around capitol hill until he gets the real dirt there is one fewer sleuth freed by his spot on the opinion pages from what novak calls the deaf dumb blind sort of impartiality that often makes news reporting worthless exposing the true machinations in the government this can be a cause for relief for many powerful people

3248257 when there is the slightest chance that any of our medical products will be exposed to a transportation operation or storage environment it is vital that we implement vibration testing before going to market

3248261 most adults throughout history have recognized that young people are likely to be unwise given their minuscule amount of life experience after all most adults even among baby boomers believe that they themselves are wiser today than 10 years ago let alone than when they were 20 years old
3248262 if one believes that the american attempt to prevent south vietnam from falling under communist totalitarian rule was an immoral imperialist venture then americas young people were terrific
3248263 the president initiate an international effort to immediately and dramatically increase the economic political and diplomatic pressure on iran to verifiably suspend its nuclear enrichment activities by inter alia prohibiting the export to iran of all refined petroleum products imposing stringent cargo inspection requirements on all persons vehicles ships planes trains and cargo entering or departing iran and prohibiting the international movement of all iranian officials not involved in negotiating the suspension of iran s nuclear program
3248264 there is the problem that everything i can see he can also not only hweig but his immediate crew since their observation is through technological implants the whole scene can be played upon a screen like our television
3248265 hweig is an enormous tease i suppose it does get boring listening in to me 24 hours a day though sometimes he takes a vacation for a week or more and someone else monitors
3248266 there are several things i can do to drive hweig up the wall
3248267 please warn me when you are going to do that
3248268 in the beginning of our association hweig terrified me with his explanations of who and what he was and what he intended to do i was afraid that my mind was going to be taken over by an alien personality however after more than four years of this constant telepathic contact i feel very much myself even more so for i know myself so much better i have had to face up to myself
3248269 with mechanical devices that permit mind invasion and control an alien civilization could conduct any kind of surveillance and there would be no defense against it the aliens can do this now how long before earth science can do the same or can they do it now can the aliens be earthians
3248270 at this time mankind stands in dead center of the crossroads of human endeavor i do not mean anything so simplistic as a single crossroads but a convergence of many roads each seductive in itself a compromise must be made and maintained if the current world civilizations are to endure the compromise must react onto many levels of human activity world government leaders are struggling to find compromises on a political level but the everyday people of the world must find their own ways of compromise on an individual level such as levels of personal beliefs as well as many other kinds the metaphysical cores not the histories of all religions should be studied and the psychological needs that shaped these beliefs only on that level can compromise be found and until then the fires of war will continue to brutalize the human race
3248271 for the first time in the course of this round of civilization world wide communication has brought all the differences of belief and activities into a coherent area of observation patiently many individual researchers in many lines have been digging into their respective studies with the advent of computer technology all of those separate researchers now can be brought under one roof so to speak they can be analyzed and studied on a comparative basis religion for example must be compared to mathematics does that sound silly it is salvation archaeology must be studied in relation to electro magnetic waves only with computers can such comparative studies be adequately carried out and they will be this is the direction in which you and all contactees are being guided toward the sharing and comparing of information which can then become a common basis for understanding

3248280 we would be opposed to ignoring a rule of rescue when it introduces a degree of flexibility around extreme cases so what if you waste a few pounds if you are doing your best for humanity
3248281 we shouldnt have a formal rule of rescue because our general guidance took into account provision for exceptional cases that can allow the institute to recommend treatment above our normal cost threshold

3248283 we are planning to introduce online testing in all schools in the kv system students will be able to test their knowledge online based on questions thrown by a question bank a report on this test will be generated thereafter

3248294 world art vision is a chance for individual artists to exhibit their most recent work but it is also an opportunity to meet with the other artists present and attend the exciting program of collateral events and conferences which are being organized and of course to meet with the public visitors collectors and critics
3248295 this is a marvellous opportunity for artists to meet with each other with the public and potential buyers cancun being a resort with extremely high level tourism and trade and we are extremely grateful for the encouragement and for the support given by the ayuntamiento benito juarez cancun and the state of quintana roo in the organisation of this event

3248306 pre employment tests may have caught john edwards as a person who may lie or not be fully honest
3248307 also the american public and the world should not have a leader who lies
3248308 i recommend pre employment testing of all candidates for u s president
3248309 a personality based pre employment test can catch a job applicant lying on the hiring evaluation so tests can catch lying politicians
3248310 in fact all presidential candidates should take a personality based pre employment test then everyone would know what each presidential candidate really is like rather than the slick persona they present to the american electorate
3248311 john edwards pre employment test results may have warned the public that what he says he does may not match what he really does wouldn t that be fantastic

3248343 our first objective is raising awareness about how big of a problem it really is and not just continuing to deny that it is not going on in my school or district second is to educate parents coaches and teachers about how dangerous this drug really is
3248344 it is not typical of what we usually run into with the coaching community nationally

3248458 my daughter who has my two young grandkids mentioned him to me last night
3248459 i had heard about him but she mentioned him again and how proud she was and what kind of work he was doing
3248460 i think thats definitely something that has always been in the back of his mind
3248461 i tried to tell him to get into the water awhile ago and he was like no
3248462 or if i have enough money after i finish paying my bills maybe even twice a day
3248463 i think its more of a socio economic factor where there are some kids that just dont get the exposure to swimming and others that do
3248464 i cant really gauge whether the interest is there because the minorities are there or because they have no other option or because theyre directed to this pool or what
3248465 the americans were going to smash them thats what we came here for
3248466 ive gone to a driving range before and hit golf balls because i saw tiger woods doing it on tv
3248467 i want more minority kids to go to a swimming pool and try to swim because of me i know im nowhere near tiger woods but i want to make a difference i want kids to say look a black swimmer and hes got a gold medal and i want them to get in the water because of it
3248468 lets say two kids are walking beside a pool and one decides it would be funny to push the other one in
3248469 if the one who gets pushed in can swim yeah maybe its funny if he cant youve got a real problem
3248470 sometimes they dont fit the mold you imagine not all kids are going to grow up and be doctors

3248476 er is in het verleden door lokale overheden ge xperimenteerd met dubbele waterleidingen met drinkwater en zogeheten grijs water

3248481 the cash we get to police our various areas across the country is provided by government is provided by people through council tax and the provision of that is to provide a policing service to those areas and to those communities
3248482 if we have to take officers away from them to police football we are not able to recover the cost of that that means our normal police budget is being used for that purpose which means we then have to provide a lesser service to the rest of the community
3248483 it is very difficult i mean it is quite clear the officers at the ground outside the ground or in areas controlled by the club that is fairly obvious and thats what we currently charge for
3248484 officers who are paraded for duty that day specifically do football duties so for instance if we are bringing large numbers of officers on to do patrols in city centres and town centres then just for the duration of the football game thats quite clear
3248485 but officers who may be doing their normal duties around those areas then that would be far more difficult perhaps we shouldnt be charging for that
3248486 the law is quite clear clubs pay for any policing inside the ground and on immediately adjacent property under their control on matchday
3248487 any other provision deemed necessary is covered by the state its what people pay their taxes for with the premier league alone contributing more than 700m a year to the treasury let alone the tax take from the 13 million fans who attend premier league games during the course of a season
3248488 this long established principle applies to all individuals and organisations in the uk from private individuals to shopping centres pubs and major events like the notting hill carnival
3248489 they have invested heavily in all seater stadia cctv and stewarding as a result the numbers of police required to ensure public safety and therefore the cost has reduced over the past 15 years
3248490 we are always happy to discuss how it might be possible to further reduce costs or indeed how football can help the police tackle youth crime but we fail to see why football fans should pay twice for policing
3248491 its when youre creating those establishments in residential communities then its set up as a
3248492 the setting up of this single regulatory body is certainly on we have to streamline details such as enforcement licensing monitoring and transport fares

3248502 primulapathis speculation that the victim may have handled the jacket is out of this world and unbecoming of an expert because the swab was taken from inside the neck area and from the armpits region
3248503 simple common sense will tell us that if the victim handled the jacket without wearing it for a significant period of time her dna would not have been deposited in that area
3248504 and he was even willing to assume that the jacket was cleaned prior to the victim handling it the real mystery is no prosecution evidence from this chemist has said how long the victim would have had to wear the jacket for it to be sufficient to leave her dna
3248505 we are committed to building awareness of asian art at the museum

3248507 all these were done without the malaysian authorities realising it possibly because the pulau pisang lighthouse issue was not as hot at that time as it is today
3248508 the sure thing is singapore has expanded the lighthouse compound the walkway and jetty on pulau pisang
3248509 this can be clearly seen today from the present size of these structures
3248510 but today the lighthouse area on the islands peak got bigger when singapore built a second fence about 100 metres from the old one
3248511 the walkway from the jetty to the lighthouse was also widened to allow heavy machinery to pass through
3248512 in the 1980s the residents sometimes saw a singaporean helicopter sending supplies and heavy materials to the lighthouse

3248549 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3248550 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3248551 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3248552 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names
3248553 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty incredible accomplishment

3248556 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3248557 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling

3248563 you go around and theres been a lot of guys who have helped us get to this point some with limited playing time
3248564 a few of these guys are going to get more at bats and more playing time and we have confidence they will help keep us in the position that were in today
3248565 were still seeking medical opinions to come up with the best course of action
3248566 obviously its a tough situation but this team has shown great perseverance all year and i expect it will continue
3248567 well continue to monitor the waiver wire but this underscores the emphasis that weve placed on depth we havent gotten to this point on the back of any one player its been a team effort all year and i expect that to continue
3248568 its non displaced which is good news as were looking at it now we dont think it will be too long after that two week period
3248569 whether its three weeks or a little bit sooner than that or a little bit later im not sure
3248570 different things create opportunities you can reflect on the negative part or on the positive of giving these guys opportunities to help this team further our lead in the standings
3248571 thats the way were going to look at it it doesnt do any good to dwell on the other side
3248572 to come off the terrible month that we had in cincinnati and you get a phone call today saying youre being traded to a first place team as a player thats all you could ask for

3248615 it was definitely an amazing and emotional experience to see him

3248617 a government led by the same leader is a government with more experience in business and trade i hope there will not be much change
3248618 the general view is that the political situation is more stable than five to ten years ago
3248619 our customers want stability they are saying if there is stability we will invest our money
3248620 there are three things the government should be focusing on jobs jobs and jobs less than 10 percent of university graduates are finding jobs

3248628 hes got great speed great hands were going to try to utilize him as best as we can so hes got to touch the field
3248629 there are college juniors doing what hes doing as a freshman
3248630 im sure they will after weve played two or three games
3248631 this is his last year hes been there when i get in trouble i ask him what to do
3248632 tough hard nosed guy coach loves that hes an excellent blocker hes not scared to put his nose in there and knock a guy off the ball
3248633 at the beginning i was getting nervous right now im trying to be real relaxed
3248634 sometimes in one on one drills we think hes our best receiver
3248635 he has to take his playing one on one into the team concept doug mcneil could really help us this year if he keeps improving

3248640 instead of having made vast progress since 2000 dedicated courts have declined in numbers sa police service family violence child protection and sexual offences units have been redeployed trained forensic social workers employed by the police have become quite scarce some magistrates have become obstructive the system of district surgeons was abolished giving rise to a loss of expertise and the need for training of all remains with language barriers exacerbating every identified issue
3248641 they do not know how to provide protection to the child and are unaware of removal provisions
3248642 crime scenes are not visited and pieces of evidence like stained clothes and bed linen are not gathered or gathered too late
3248643 in most cases the investigating officer is male so it is difficult for women and children to relate to them
3248644 there are some doctors who are trained but they are just not interested
3248645 we knew it was going to be quick swimming has changed in the nine months since world champs our time yesterday would have won the world champs nine months ago things changed and unfortunately we couldnt change fast enough
3248646 if you look at it were the only team that had the same four guys from athens we didnt have the squad that the americans did they could change in three guys for the final we were always going to be up against it
3248647 were still proud of what we achieved keeping the guys together is kind of a miracle we have to talk to the coaches to see what is going on and what we can do to plan for the next four years i think were on the ball but we need to go back and work smarter
3248648 everyone expected us to get a medal but we never expected us to get a medal no one in the world expected us to get a medal for us it was about going out and having some fun seeing how well we could go
3248649 im happy with how it went i corrected a few mistakes i made last night and i went a little bit faster
3248650 i thought i had a 47 second 100m in me during the semifinal and i still believe i can go 47 in two days last night i was a little slow out of the blocks i had a short stroke into the wall a long touch i went out fast i wanted to put my body on the line for the team and get us a good start

3248681 a stationary command post was not set up but instead remained mobile which played a role in communicating with the fire crews
3248682 the incident commander failed to establish good communication with interior crews
3248683 at that particular time with the radios that we were using and the communication equipment that we had a loud noise makes verbal communication all but impossible
3248684 people should not be afraid of their government the government should be afraid of its people
3248685 the fact that the daily mail may have been in breach of section 97 itself does not mean that she can properly complain
3248686 it seems to me to be a clear case where the courts conscience is offended by the fact that the prosecution is brought by a person who by her conduct was likely if not certain to identify the child as being the subject of proceedings to which section 97 applied
3248687 with ruud moving on we believe that this is the right time to make more sweeping changes throughout the organisation
3248688 our commitment continues to be focused on not only winning the mls cup this and every season but to build a club capable of competing at the international level
3248689 this decision is the right one for the organisation the right one for the players and the right one for our fans
3248690 i think in the next few months we will further see a slowdown in inflation
3248691 producer price figures showed costs pressures remained quite big while consumer price figures showed price rises on the consumption side have eased
3248692 what is especially encouraging is that the price hike on oil products prices in june did not change the declining trend of the inflation
3248693 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3248694 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3248695 its quite possible that they will use this was support for their case but one cant determine that because a species is under less threat from extinction that its automatically okay to start hunting them
3248696 in effect we have nearly 900 less cops in the sydney metropolitan area than we did in 2003
3248697 these are figures supplied by the nsw police force in terms of actual police officers in nsw
3248698 were talking about the numbers of cops in the 46 area commands that make up the sydney basin
3248699 despite all of the government spin despite all of the comments that everything is fine in terms of policing in nsw these figures show there has been a steady decline in terms of police numbers in the sydney metropolitan area since the high point in 2003
3248700 and ive been to a number of local area commands in the last couple of weeks that are either at authorised strength some are above some are just below awaiting existing recruits
3248701 we found that qantas comes under fire from some media that clearly contradicts a more widespread view of qantas customers that voted for the airline in the survey
3248702 we do find that many countries flag carrier airlines suffer fairly vitriolic levels of reporting in their local regions and the airline industry remains a business that some areas of the press seem to love to hate
3248703 he had a plate put in there the radius bone above the wrist to stabilise the affected area on monday and he will miss the remainder of the season
3248704 brodie had worked hard to overcome his achilles injury and to have this happen at this time of year after battling through his rehabilitation for a long time is shocking luck
3248705 if this issue is as serious as it appears to be then we can solve it
3248706 but we cant solve it by being paralysed by all these parochial views
3248707 whats happening is that people who like natural gas over promote natural gas and overly criticise all the other ones
3248708 the people who like ethanol overly promote ethanol and overly criticise all the other ones
3248709 the next thing you know youve got all these people digging their heels in thinking theres a single answer and thats the only thing you should invest in

3248713 i will not discuss or talk about that any more than that if someone wants to criticize me for that thats fine
3248714 what i was thinking was this was something that was personal to my own family
3248715 john mccain talk about the mistakes that hes made in his past with respect to his first marriage
3248716 i wish they tortured those pieces of shit before killing them
3248717 what i was thinking was this was something that was personal to my own family

3248755 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
3248756 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
3248757 there is an unmistakeable degree of recovery in july which is surprising given that it is generally regarded as the worst winter month with good improvement in median prices around the country despite continued low sales volumes
3248758 but as we have pointed out before those qv statistics are based on property settlements whereas ours are based on unconditional contracts so invevitably the earlier statistics relate to june sales reported in july
3248759 as for the long term prognosis there are plenty of people taking about a 10 per cent decline in values but based on todays figures a decline of that magnitude is not evident yet
3248760 if this is as bad as it gets then perhaps the market is in better shape than we thought
3248761 northlands median price was back up after a big fall in june to 302 750 at 315 00 for july while waikato and the bay of plenty was up from 316 000 in june to 325 000 in july
3248762 hawkes bay provided particularly strong evidence of its recovery with an increase in the median price for the district from 216 000 to 282 000 while manawatu and wanganui were up from 213 750 to 233 750
3248763 taranaki was up from 255 000 to 265 000 and wellington was up from 366 500 in june to 371 000 in july
3248764 nelson and marlborough were again a little weaker with a median down from 335 000 in june to 330 000 but canterbury and westland recovered slightly from 299 000 to 300 000
3248765 central otago lakes district was up from 514 000 to 565 000 but on low sales while otago rallied from 225 000 in june to 240 000 in july

3248827 god is one he is unified and there exists no unity similar to his in the world
3248828 foothold for a person of understanding to develop a love for god
3248829 the first verse of the shema is a confession that everything depends on this unity every possible influence

3248847 a resolution to the energy crisis is going to take some bold moves
3248848 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3248849 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3248850 if you look at the streets everything seems calm and peaceful
3248851 the uighurs are driving cars and motorcycles they have shops but behind it all the situation is different people are really angry

3248881 its so awesome it gets three smileys in a row how awesome is that lol hehe
3248882 i think what we shot for the cover was really very interesting especially where we used sheets and all and its just that there is a great sensuality to it i always think that minimal make up and no fuss hair takes away from everything and its all about the eyes

3248885 its a nice gesture but he could probably help a lot more people by looking at the tax increases that are being talked about
3248886 it was their democratic caucus that put that pay increase in place
3248887 it seems like something very handy to bring up now
3248888 we have opened a criminal investigation and are investigating it thoroughly
3248889 that should just be part of every boaters routine when they bring their boat out of the water
3248890 as long as fishermen are using common sense practices washing their hands thoroughly cooking their fish before they eat there should be no problem for humans
3248891 it doesnt matter where they are at in illinois they have got to eliminate natural water from their boats
3248892 our conservation police officers will check the public boat ramps when they are out for their safety checks
3248893 it gives them a tremendous area of responsibility to enforce rules and regulations including the new vhs regulations
3248894 it may have an impact not only on the bigger fish the commercial fish like the chinook salmon but also on the forage fish
3248895 its not going to wipe them out but it certainly could do some damage to the lakes fishery
3248896 theres really nothing you can do once its in there is no vaccine theres no treatment its basically watch your fish die it all comes down to prevention
3248897 im not opposed to green things as long as they yield results but if its a feel good thing im opposed
3248898 part of the scope is to come up with specific projects project costs and pay back
3248899 we dont want to replace something and say oh we could have saved 50 000 this year
3248900 we want to make sure were doing the best we can to save money
3248901 as a coalition we are more likely to achieve the gold standard for breast feeding rates for kane county which will help us reach our goal of having the healthiest residents in illinois by 2030
3248902 one of the things were trying to develop is pretrial probation services that deals with people who are in county jail awaiting trial and try to see if there are some services that could be provided to not have them sit in jail
3248903 many of the people in terms of nonviolent offenders are people who dont have money to post bond
3248904 management had a four year package for less money but through negotiations we came to that meeting point
3248905 we have some quality officers who provide a continuum of care on the front line of public safety
3248906 we cannot implement the pay raises without an appropriation but more importantly i am of the opinion that this is no time for pay raises
3248907 i think thats just a way to distract us from the real issue
3248908 ben would understandably have preferred to earn this sum through a full career as a professional footballer
3248909 i thought the boy showed fantastic focus a great attitude to hard work and they are qualities to give any player an outstanding chance in the game
3248910 everything is very well organised but you have to get your act together at the olympic village you have no driver at the door and no amazing room but you do not need that to be happy
3248911 this really helps you see what real life is like
3248912 i wish many other weeks were like this because i love being with people and fortunately the spanish team at these games is very large
3248913 at dinner he could barely eat it was incredible how many athletes went up to him he must have signed like 100 autographs and he must have had about as many photographs taken
3248914 i live with other sportsmen from other disciplines in one place it is an honour i am having a great time and i have my picture taken without a problem because those who ask me are just like me sportsmen
3248915 its expected that the task team will report to the icc and participating countries soon after which csa will discuss the matter further
3248916 for me the last four years have been tough after athens it was hard to take the plunge all over again but i decided to take it i worked hard and went for it theres not much to say except that you keep at it and at it one day it falls in your hand thats what happened i have had a lot of support from many people and one of them coach j s dhillon is here
3248917 i wasnt thinking about history i was lying two points behind the leader i just wanted to shoot and i wanted to shoot aggressively and thats what i did
3248918 its incredible to see an indian be in contention for a major jeevs performance is all the more special because the conditions were very tough and he was competing against the best in the world im sure many indian golfers would like to follow in jeevs footsteps
3248919 its absolutely fantastic to have an indian finish in the top 10 at a major
3248920 i would like to congratulate jeev on his tied ninth finish at the uspga he deserves all the accolades as his performances have raised the profile of indian golf i was expecting him to do really well at the uspga championship because he has a great run over the last few months i was ecstatic when he led after the first round
3248921 its the first top 10 finish for an indian at a major his feat is a reflection of the rising standards of indian golf and will inspire many upcoming golfers in this country this is a proud moment for all of us at pgti
3248922 follow this wherever it goes and peel this guy like an onion
3248923 putting it back the way it was for 100 years definitely will help
3248924 i think ive counted six people in a day using the bike lane tops no one uses the thing
3248925 its always difficult when its the first project in a plan
3248926 sometimes the owner of a building and the business operator are two different people
3248927 with anything that is brand new there are opportunities to step back and reflect as to what could and should be modified this clearly is an example of such reflection
3248928 i am pleased that we are on course in terms of education that the kids achievements are driving the budget
3248929 this years budget shows how rising fuel costs are affecting school districts
3248930 last fiscal year we supplemented out travel budget by 582 000 to cover increasing fuel costs in this budget we have increased our request to 3 million for fuel
3248931 after a huge misstep in the blogosphere sony playstation has come back with a plan to engage consumers and win back trust
3248932 if youre an existing business and people are going to build houses around you and complain the noise ive got a problem with that
3248933 if they were there first and people move around them knowing its a business i have a problem telling them what time they can do deliveries you can work with them talk to them but to force them to do it i have a problem with that
3248934 if its causing a problem for the residents then its causing a problem for the residents
3248935 we want to do it with renewable energy because after the initial payback with installation theres no cost
3248936 all these schools are saying this would really help us in controlling our costs since the state has been somewhat irresponsible in funding us at 31 percent
3248937 we currently have enrolled 1 899 kindergarten students and thats up 57 students from sept 30 last year
3248938 and we have 27 students enrolled in half day kindergarten district wide and thats an afternoon session
3248939 last year the average size of a class in kindergarten was 22 74 students
3248940 currently as we stand right now it is 23 44 so we have gained only 3 4 of a student
3248941 when it was all said and done most of our all day kindergarten teachers are from our own buildings they are not new to 204
3248942 in fact we hired four new teachers and all the rest are people who were just excited for the opportunity and asked to be moved
3248943 we are going to have access to the curriculum and instruction and be able to go deeper and improve student learning
3248944 so we have set a lofty but attainable goal that 90 percent of our kindergartners will meet or exceed expectations on several assessments so well have a point of comparison
3248945 the site is just about at the geographic center of our membership and it has wonderful visibility
3248946 were certainly pleased that theyve chosen to locate in bloomingdale and it should be a nice facility
3248947 we would like to be the gateway into the village of bloomingdale
3248948 especially at this time when were in a down market we need to be that much more aggressive
3248949 this isnt intended for little projects but to promote major investment or development
3248950 and hopefully developers would invest more than they would otherwise
3248951 we collected blood put it on oxygen and pulled some fluid off the lungs
3248952 we took an ultrasound of the heart its blood pressure was really low

3248954 just be aware this is potentially toxic to cats as well as dogs
3248955 we like to write it up as a case study in the journal of veterinary emergency and critical care
3248956 it would be nice to publish it and get the word out

3249000 we are seeing utter destitution we see malnutrition we are seeing depression we see homelessness people are coming to us from a place of crisis
3249001 there are still a number of people in the community who came out during world youth day there is certainly an expectation that some will decide to seek asylum rather that return

3249003 when science finally locates the center of the universe some people will be surprised to learn
3249004 the belief that there is only one truth and that oneself is in possession of it seems to me the deepest root of all evil that is in the world
3249005 i would rather have a mind opened by wonder than one closed by belief

3249012 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3249013 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3249014 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3249015 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3249016 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3249017 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3249018 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3249020 welcome to the dc 5 planetary history art and science museum i am guide robot 3 would you like to begin your tour now
3249021 you see before you a reenactment of the departure of the ship that brought the first colonists from their home planet twilow here to dc 5 the large majority of the colonists were the highly educated and underemployed offspring of well to do families if not the best and brightest of their generation they were certainly among the most expendable
3249022 the first colonists were charged with the task of making sure the operation of the region 461 records depository ran smoothly and indeed it has thanks to their untiring vigilance and the fact that the entire depository is fully automated
3249023 like so many pioneers before them the early colonists of dc 5 suffered privation and hardship unknown to their brethren who stayed safely at home on twilow as illustrated by the scene before you the early colonists were often forced to sit together and watch the same show at the same time we can only imagine the strife and agony caused by this situation one cant help but be amazed at the relatively low homicide rate during those first stressful years but there was no alternative at the time high shipping costs prevented importation of additional holovid units let alone the cost of a true virtual reality network so the brave pioneers made due with what they had and prayed for deliverance
3249024 there you go again with the telephone bit what are you talking about
3249025 i mean simply that i am not programmed to answer why questions

3249027 i go down to philip pullmans house and go through his trash
3249028 why harry potter became a phenomenon while artemis fowl only remains a huge sensation is a conundrum for future ages to ponder
3249029 once we were off and running with the other books we got a lot of feedback internally
3249030 people asked why arent we doing all three were giving them the same attention
3249031 i was able to obtain copies of the photographs from the photographer tyler cobbs
3249032 to my delight he was very cooperative in providing me with the color photos which i use today in my displays to inform others and receive support as we voice our concerns
3249033 the signs are also particularly poignant for the various ute tribes and bands that were forcibly relocated to various reservations in the state of utah and colorado
3249034 although the university of utah no longer endorses the ute name as a mascot but rather as a nickname for its athletic teams unfortunately with the continued use of the ute name many fans of rival universitys take up the name an use it in a racist hostile and abusive contexts
3249035 native people are always being stereotyped and the more schools use native people or images as a mascot it opens doors for bigotry and racial discrimination
3249036 i was very surprised he treated our request with such blankness
3249037 i am still waiting for a phone call or letter regarding our request to meet with president samuelson or tom holmoe
3249038 the comments of this single fan certainly do not represent the views of the byu athletic department nor of the university i apologize for the distress that her remarks displayed however briefly have caused you and any others we will continue to encourage our fans to demonstrate good sportsmanship and respect for all people
3249039 i would have been happy to explain our response to this incident and our feelings about it if you had contacted me before you launched your petition drive
3249040 i immediately mailed an apology to the people who contacted me regarding this issue i had not heard of the incident until i received the letter
3249041 tom holmoe forwarded me your inquiry your questions are answered in the response that tom sent the petitioners on july 16 after the first time he heard from them
3249042 we wholeheartedly agree with you and your petitioners that these particular remarks were inappropriate and offensive that is why our staff intervened as soon as they saw them and told the fan they must be erased
3249043 after she wrote another offensive phrase our staff informed her she could not display the dry erase board at all and enforced this requirement for the rest of the match
3249044 i saw that the students were more angered when they saw the photos over 150 navajo students signed the petition during their lunch hour
3249045 grandma youve worked your fingers to the bone you deserve this
3249046 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3249049 if only i could call him because hes the only one who understands
3249050 everything will work out for the best this was bound to happen
3249051 when we know ourselves when we see that god is the reason for our groaning then we achieve an insight that gives us confidence in the greatest and deepest sadness we see death in the light of life we justify god who by his spirit causes us to groan in this tent we see the necessity of death and of the no in transitoriness they are needed to free a place as they do their work true life comes closer we are closer to the goal of being clothed upon with our heavenly dwelling
3249052 why the future of business is selling less of more
3249053 those who are dead are not dead there just living in my head and since i fell for that spell i am living there as well
3249054 paparazzi it went better than i would have expected and got a lot of complements marshall got to hang with the decatur folks though which was huge since hell be back at moorehouse in a few weeks i hung out for a bit but made it an early night

3249057 i think if i died nobody would notice the neighbors might notice my children wearing black except that they wear black anyway
3249058 nobody comes to see me i dont want to think that god has forgotten me
3249059 woman believe me the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in jerusalem will you worship the father you worship what you do not know we worship what we know for salvation is from the jews
3249060 and i will pray the father and he will give you another counselor to be with you for ever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows him you know him for he dwells with you and will be in you i will not leave you desolate i will come to you yet a little while and the world will see me no more but you will see me because i live you will live also in that day you will know that i am in my father and you in me and i in you he who has my commandments and keeps them he it is who loves me and he who loves me will be loved by my father and i will love him and manifest myself to him
3249061 the lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile

3249095 a southern teacher should however definitely know better than to wear blackface into the classroom her attempts to appear old enough to remember when minstrel shows were not considered offensive will not save her from community ire unless of course the community is made up entirely of pubescent boys in that case she can basically wear a klan hood as long as the costume doesnt extend below her neck
3249096 judging by the beady eyed look of horror from the concessions worker i think the gold in question is a reference to the several inches of liquid butter at the bottom of the bucket which this plugger bear is shown pawing at reminiscent of winnie the pooh gorging himself on a pot of honey the difference of course being that pooh died from complications due to his type ii diabetes plugger bear here though he likely suffers from hypoglycemia if not full blown diabetes is probably going to go out from a massive coronary during the movie

3249110 naked i came from my mothers womb and naked i will depart the lord gave and the lord has taken away may the name of the lord be praised
3249111 may the day of my birth perish and the night it was said a boy is born may god above not care about it may no light shine upon it
3249112 can a mortal be more righteous than god if god places no trust in his servants if he charges his angels with error how much more those who live in houses of clay whose foundations are in the dust who are crushed more readily than a moth
3249113 what is man that you make so much of him
3249114 yet if you devote your heart to him and stretch out your hands to him if you put away the sin that is in your hand then you will lift up your face without shame you will stand firm and without fear life will be brighter than noonday and darkness will become like morning you will look about you and take your rest in safety
3249115 but i desire to speak to the almighty you however smear me with lies you are worthless physicians all of you for you that would be wisdom
3249116 though he slay me yet will i hope in him
3249117 only grant me these two things o god and then i will not hide from you and stop frightening me with your terrors how many wrongs and sins have i committed show me my offense and my sin
3249118 he is not a man like me that i might answer him that we might confront each other in court if only there were someone to arbitrate between us someone to remove gods rod from me so that his terror would frighten me no more but as it now stands with me i cannot
3249119 if i have walked in falsehood or my foot has hurried after deceit if my steps have turned from the path if my heart has been led by my eyes then may others eat what i have sown and may my crops be uprooted f my heart has been enticed by a woman or if i have lurked at my neighbors door for that would have been shameful a sin to be judged it is a fire that burns to destruction if i have denied justice to my menservants and maidservants what will i do when god confronts me what will i answer when called to account did not he who made me in the womb make them did not the same one form us both within our mothers if i have denied the desires of the poor if i have kept my bread to myself not sharing it with the fatherless but from my youth i reared him as would a father if i have seen anyone perishing for lack of clothing or a needy man without a garment for warming him with the fleece from my sheep if i have raised my hand against the fatherless then let my arm fall from the shoulder let it be broken off at the joint and for fear of his splendor i could not do such things or said to pure gold you are my security if i have rejoiced over my great wealth if i have regarded the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor and my hand offered them a kiss of homage then these also would be sins to be judged for i would have been unfaithful to god on high if i have rejoiced at my enemys misfortune or gloated over the trouble that came to him i have not allowed my mouth to sin if the men of my household have never said who has not had his fill of jobs meat but no stranger had to spend the night in the street for my door was always open to the traveler if i have concealed my sin as men do because i so feared the crowd and so dreaded the contempt of the clans that i kept silent and would not go outside oh that i had someone to hear me i sign now my defense let the almighty answer me let my accuser put his indictment in writing i would give him an account of my every step like a prince i would approach him
3249120 but i tell you in this you are not right for god is greater than man for god does speak now one way now another though man may not perceive it when deep sleep falls on men as they slumber in their beds to turn man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride his life from perishing by the sword
3249121 god does all these things to a man twice even three times that the light of life may shine on him
3249122 far be it from god to do evil he repays a man for what he has done he brings upon him what his conduct deserves who appointed him over the earth who put him in charge of the whole world all mankind would perish together and man would return to the dust
3249123 what is the way to the abode of light and where does darkness reside do you know the paths to their dwellings surely you know for you were already born you have lived so many years
3249124 but he stands alone and who can oppose him he carries out his decree against me and many such plans he still has in store god has made my heart faint the almighty has terrified me
3249125 and we know that in all things god works for the good of those who love him who have been called according to his purpose
3249126 this case is not as black and white as it looks

3249128 chinese have the highest breast cancer rates followed by malays and indians but the pattern of breast cancer according to age is quite different

3249130 singapore women have adopted more western lifestyles they are having fewer and fewer kids
3249131 they have their first child later in life which means they have an increased risk of breast cancer because there are few factors that protect women from breast cancer the same way as having many children and the first child very early in life
3249132 the important message that we want to get across is that women who are 50 and above especially those who have started their family late and have a small number of children should go for mammographic screening
3249133 more of the women without cancer were eating soy products compared to those with breast cancer weve also found that women who had most protection were women who had been eating soy foods since adolescent days

3249193 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years

3249209 russias aggression against georgia is both a matter of urgent moral and strategic importance to the united states

3249275 just get through that and prepare myself for tomorrow thats the most important thing an afternoon off and its time to just sort of get as rested as i can recover and i probably have to re shave get all of that stuff down
3249276 we are told namely that there was once in the western parts of libya on the bounds of the inhabited world a race which was ruled by women and followed a manner of life unlike that which prevails among us for it was the custom among them that the women should practice the arts of war and be required to serve in the army for a fixed period during which time they maintained their virginity then when the years of their service in the field had expired they went in to the men for the procreation of children but they kept in their hands the administration of the magistracies and of all the affairs of the state the men however like our married women spent their days about the house carrying out the orders which were given them by their wives and they took no part in military campaigns or in office or in the exercise of freedom of speech in the affairs of the community by virtue of which they might become presumptuous and rise up against the women when their children were born the babies were turned over to the men who brought them up on milk and such cooked foods as were appropriate to the age of the infants and if it happened that a girl was born its breasts were seared that they might not develop at the time of maturity for they thought that the breasts as they stood out from the body were no small hindrance in warfare and in fact it is because they have been deprived of their breasts that they are called by the greeks amazons

3249309 theyre showing us thats what they want thats what we need to do it
3249310 were going to keep doing it were not going to back off it i dont think you can run it unless you commit to run it unless you practice running it
3249311 i know there were a lot of expectations you cant look into that game too much thats why were in training camp
3249312 were committed to doing it even when its not looking good
3249313 this running game this commitment to running the football is not just us on offense its a whole team effort
3249314 the only way youre going to get better at it is committing to it and doing it you might be running into a rock a few times but youve just got to keep working at it
3249315 when you stay with something and have a belief in it its going to get better and better
3249316 physically you gear in every day and go to work on it it identifies who youre trying to become this game is still about being physical
3249317 theres nothing to me more demoralizing than a defense thats struggling to stop the run theres nothing you can do now you start gambling with stuff it becomes hit or miss
3249318 if we win tonight you have to come back every night
3249319 im a big tigers fan want us to suit up
3249320 im going to do everything i can humanly possibly do as mayor to make sure he gets a new home hes a real inspiration
3249321 if we dont ask for help he wont all of us have a chance to work in life he cant work his job is letting us know how lucky we are
3249322 you get a chance to play in a game like situation and grade yourself on the film
3249323 it was the first day of pads i was running off the field fell to my knees and threw up
3249324 i aint never threw up in my life in any sport i dont like admitting it but i did that clicked like its going to be a long spring ball
3249325 it was tough at the beginning but now they understand my personality and i understand their personality
3249326 mike came up to me and said i look at you and youre the only person that is not finishing
3249327 i thought about it i rode the bike and kept thinking about it i went home and thought about it and he was right ive got to be the guy who steps up and ive got to be the guy who loses 20 pounds or however many pounds i needed to lose to get in the best shape of my life to finish the runs and play hard and not get angry when i get tired all that stuff started going through my head and i wanted to do it
3249328 i just knew that being an older guy being a leader i had to step up
3249329 i cant be the guy throwing up or not being in the front when were running sprints and gassers and not finishing i couldnt be that guy i could have been that guy last year or the year before because i had older guys in front of me but i want to be that guy i want to be that guy whos not tired in the fourth quarter thats what i want to be i feel that now im the best condition of my life
3249330 sometimes when youre out of shape and getting tired and getting pushed to a new limit its easy to be surly
3249331 but now when youre in shape you dont get tired as much so you dont have as many opportunities to be surly i guess terrances attitude has been outstanding and im really pleased with the way he came into preseason camp
3249332 he looks like a beast out there hes looking real nice i cant wait to see him out there because his drive is real strong
3249333 i wanted to beat ohio state because i havent yet
3249334 a lot played into it i love michigan i dont want to have any regrets last year i felt i would have had a lot of regrets i didnt do this i didnt finish that so i came back and im happy i came back because im in so much better shape than when i was when i was getting ready to leave so different
3249335 he just didnt have it kind of a dead arm night for him
3249336 thats why i got him out of there early with a reasonable pitch count
3249337 but when you could tell he wasnt right everybody kind of got the blahs
3249338 i dont want skip to think that i cant do that anymore because of this result
3249339 i feel im perfectly capable of throwing 130 pitches and coming back to be successful in the next start as well
3249340 that one in chicago was the fastest home run ive ever seen hit
3249341 you just shake your head at the stuff he does night after night
3249342 its pretty hard to hit a line drive 440 feet
3249343 ive seen him take rips when hes fouled the ball back or swung and missed
3249344 and ive thought i wish hed gotten that one what im saying is that i think hes got even more than what weve seen
3249345 thats the one thing i can say about this whole thing i dont regret anything that ever happened honestly i can say i would not do anything different
3249346 i love it down here i love all the guys i love the program i love all the coaches i couldnt be more happy
3249347 i dont think hes available or we can afford him so well have to skip that
3249348 weve tried to look at different ways to be more proactive better in our educational efforts im very confident this year will be different but only time will tell just like our results on the field
3249349 you can never tell a quarterback enough that the best decision sometimes is a ball thrown into the first row
3249350 ive been able to relate different thoughts and help people in those types of situations
3249351 im just happy im still here obviously and ill just try to do my best out of the bullpen
3249352 we said wed bring him back if he worked it out so hopefully well see that up here what hes done down there
3249353 to try to make myself a more well rounded pitcher
3249354 whatever i can do to help the team win thats what im here to do
3249355 walter is a player with tremendous work ethic and showed last year that hes a player that can contribute to this team

3249397 while i had listened to several of the bats casts over the last year it is only when you consume one sometimes two a day over the course of a week that you really begin to get the wow factor of all the bat has time to do i mean the intros alone are sort of other worldly
3249398 bat segundo is clearly a nutcase i would advise anyone against paying him any credence

3249410 i find it significant that the two leaders are taking personal responsibility
3249411 i think this is evidence of a new sense of purpose

3249413 in the event that the taiwan independence forces should act under any name or by any means to cause the fact of taiwans secession from china or that major incidents entailing taiwans secession from china should occur or that possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted that the state shall employ non peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect chinas sovereignty and territorial integrity

3249441 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
3249442 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
3249443 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
3249444 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
3249445 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
3249446 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
3249447 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
3249448 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
3249449 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
3249450 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
3249451 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
3249452 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
3249453 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
3249454 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
3249455 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
3249456 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
3249457 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
3249458 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
3249459 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
3249460 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
3249461 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
3249462 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
3249463 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
3249464 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
3249465 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it

3249471 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
3249472 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
3249473 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
3249474 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
3249475 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
3249476 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
3249477 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
3249478 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
3249479 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
3249480 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
3249481 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
3249482 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
3249483 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
3249484 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
3249485 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
3249486 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
3249487 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
3249488 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
3249489 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
3249490 as soon as a durable peace takes hold we need to move forward with dialogue and peaceful negotiations
3249491 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3249492 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community

3249506 said to contain lists of many different groupings of asanas as well as highly original teachings on vinyasa drishti bandhas mudras and philosophy
3249507 was imparted to sri t krishnamacharya in the early 1900s by his guru rama mohan brahmachari and was later passed down to pattabhi jois during the duration of his studies with krishnamacharya beginning in 1927
3249508 not possible to practice the limbs and sub limbs of yama and niyama when the body and sense organs are weak and haunted by obstacles
3249509 vinyasa means breathing and movement system for each movement there is one breath for example in surya namskar there are nine vinyasas the first vinyasa is inhaling while raising your arms over your head and putting your hands together the second is exhaling while bending forward placing your hands next to your feet etc in this way all asanas are assigned a certain number of vinyasas
3249510 three places of attention or action posture breathing system and looking place these three are very important for yoga practice and cover three levels of purification the body nervous system and mind they are always performed in conjunction with each other
3249511 the method for purifying and strengthening the body is called
3249512 the primary series yoga chikitsa detoxifies and aligns the body the intermediate series nadi shodhana purifies the nervous system by opening and clearing the energy channels the advanced series a b c and d sthira bhaga integrate the strength and grace of the practice requiring higher levels of flexibility and humility each level is to be fully developed before proceeding to the next and the sequential order of asanas is to be meticulously followed each posture is a preparation for the next developing the strength and balance required to move further
3249513 both the inhale and exhale should be steady and even the length of the inhale should be the same length as the exhale
3249514 seal in energy give lightness strength and health to the body and help to build a strong internal fire
3249515 occurs spontaneously in a subtle form in many asanas due to the
3249516 this lock prevents pranic energy from escaping and stops any build up of pressure in the head when holding the breath
3249517 breathing will not be correct and the asanas will give no benefit
3249518 there are nine dristhis the nose between the eyebrows navel thumb hands feet up right side and left side dristhi purifies and stabilizes the functioning of the mind
3249519 mula bandha uddiyana bandha and jalandhara bandha and they should be performed while practicing asana and the like
3249520 in this way did patanjali start yoga by using mulabandha and by controlling the mind he gradually gained knowledge of yoga
3249521 through the practice of pranayama the mind becomes arrested in a single direction and follows the movement of the breath
3249522 with a subdued mind unshackled from the external and internal sense organs

3249529 the longer i live the more i realize the impact of attitude on life attitude to me is more important than facts it is more important than the past the education the money than circumstances than failure than successes than what other people think or say or do it is more important than appearance giftedness or skill it will make or break a company a church a home the remarkable thing is we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day we cannot change our past we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way we cannot change the inevitable the only thing we can do is play on the one string we have and that is our attitude i am convinced that life is 10 what happens to me and 90 of how i react to it and so it is with you we are in charge of our attitudes
3249530 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3249531 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3249532 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3249533 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3249534 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3249535 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3249536 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3249537 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3249538 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

3249540 what did you think the author meant when he said that guy died slowly and remorsefully
3249541 the right to swing my fist ends where the other mans nose begins
3249542 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3249543 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3249544 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3249545 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3249546 obama is not a muslim and those terrible racists are spreading libelous rumor
3249547 when you look at his opposition to the born alive infants protection act in illinois and the partial birth abortion ban which many mass attending catholics view as bans on infanticide obamas more extreme than any other democratic presidential candidate
3249548 its the kind of reason we will be able to explain with a clean heart to the victims of abortion when we meet them face to face in the next life which we most certainly will if were confident that these victims will accept our motives as something more than an alibi then we can proceed
3249549 there was never a lot of discussion about the issues we work on and he wasnt working with older communities get out their vote
3249550 hes pretty much unknown on these issues as a result and has a lot of work to do
3249551 the right to swing my fist ends where the other mans nose begins
3249552 het is tijd om een eind aan de misdaad hier te maken
3249553 om de chaos enigszins te overzien te houden mag er niemand meer uit je kunt er niet veilig over straat lopen de politie weet ook niet wie er vuurgevaarlijk is
3249554 ze weten precies wie er betrokken zijn wie schiet en wie rooft het lijkt erop dat justitie hier niets mee te maken wil hebben
3249555 the theme you selected is a designer theme you must first add this theme
3249556 the right to swing my fist ends where the other mans nose begins
3249557 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3249558 ive never felt ive been valued by anyone im just a waste of space that everyone ignores like a ghost without a home
3249559 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3249560 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3249561 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3249562 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3249563 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3249564 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3249565 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3249566 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3249567 ive never felt ive been valued by anyone im just a waste of space that everyone ignores like a ghost without a home
3249568 the right to swing my fist ends where the other mans nose begins
3249569 ive never felt ive been valued by anyone im just a waste of space that everyone ignores like a ghost without a home
3249570 one of our immediate goals is to offer produce to wholesalers and retail outlets in and around zimbabwes midland provinces a longer term goal is to establish a training program so african youth from outside of zimbabwe and even outside africa will visit meet train work and bond with their counterparts on the farm
3249571 the right to swing my fist ends where the other mans nose begins
3249572 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3249573 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3249574 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3249575 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3249576 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3249577 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3249578 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3249579 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3249580 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3249581 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3249582 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3249583 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3249584 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3249585 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3249586 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3249587 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3249588 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3249589 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3249590 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3249591 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3249592 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3249593 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3249594 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3249595 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3249596 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3249597 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3249598 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3249599 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3249600 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3249601 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3249602 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3249603 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3249604 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3249605 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3249606 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3249607 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3249608 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3249609 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3249610 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3249611 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3249612 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3249613 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3249614 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3249615 who are open to doing something on the production side
3249616 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3249617 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3249618 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3249619 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3249620 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3249621 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3249622 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3249623 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3249624 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3249625 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3249626 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3249627 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3249628 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3249629 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3249630 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

3249657 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3249658 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3249659 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3249660 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3249661 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3249662 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3249663 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3249664 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3249665 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3249666 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

3249691 back off give me a break or leave me alone
3249692 i am nervous going into the water again because i almost did drown once
3249693 i was out in the water and then the wave came but we learned in school to swim the other way when you get caught
3249694 there is a cultural issue that is translating into a drowning epidemic
3249695 now two to three generations of nonswimmers have an endemic fear of the water
3249696 many of these folks who are coming into the country today are from countries where traditionally they dont swim
3249697 the make a splash program becomes a conduit for our kids to become confident swimmers
3249698 the time to teach swimming is when a child is 7 8 9 10 years old instead of waiting
3249699 coming to the open ocean is a whole different thing than swimming in the pool
3249700 because underneath theres riptides and its dangerous if you dont know what you are doing
3249701 you cant say to a child you dont know how to swim so when you go to the beach dont go in the water
3249702 a campanha tem o objetivo de evitar a rub ola cong nita importante todas as pessoas se conscientizarem e tomarem a vacina para evitar a doen a nas futuras gera es

3249704 it is the funniest thing youve ever seen but also the most dangerous thing
3249705 the buses pass within a foot of each other on the t way and theres nowhere for cyclists or pedestrians to go
3249706 its only a matter of time before someone is killed
3249707 its a bit more complex than we had thought it was
3249708 there was good evidence that either cell type could be the origin of medulloblastomas but no one considered that both sets of evidence could be correct and that these tumours could actually begin in two different cell types
3249709 drug development is the next stage and now we know exactly where out of a great many calls that we need to be aiming these therapies to get the best chance of attacking and killing the cancer
3249710 its basic science but its a very important step forward against a very difficult disease
3249711 but in order to develop them we needed this deeper understanding of their molecular and cellular origins
3249712 it has always been thought that cells had to mutate several times before becoming a tumour
3249713 but in this study we found that some stem cells only needed to mutate once they would not turn cancerous immediately but once they had been given an instruction to turn into a more specialised cell the mutation would take hold and they would instead turn into a tumour
3249714 i just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in georgia i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening the georgian capital tblisi

3249720 in 250cc i was on the podium and last year we won so with the bike performing as it has been lately we should be able to fight for a good result again
3249721 weve still got quite a few points to make up in the championship which wont be easy but the whole team are working so hard and well give it our best shot
3249722 after the race at laguna seca in the us i went back to australia and spent a bit of time with my wife and family away from the track
3249723 i got some rest in but i also trained hard and now i cant wait to get back on the bike
3249724 i think in the next few months we will further see a slowdown in inflation
3249725 producer price figures showed costs pressures remained quite big while consumer price figures showed price rises on the consumption side have eased
3249726 what is especially encouraging is that the price hike on oil products prices in june did not change the declining trend of the inflation
3249727 weve had x rays on it and the x rays showed it was ok but hes just feeling a bit of pain when hes running on it so we want to be a bit cautious about it
3249728 id rather go on the side of caution rather than trying to play him and making it worse and hes out for 6 10 weeks
3249729 hes an important part of our squad and hes our top scorer for the last couple of years so hell be putting pressure on people that will be playing
3249730 we found that qantas comes under fire from some media that clearly contradicts a more widespread view of qantas customers that voted for the airline in the survey
3249731 we do find that many countries flag carrier airlines suffer fairly vitriolic levels of reporting in their local regions and the airline industry remains a business that some areas of the press seem to love to hate
3249732 in effect we have nearly 900 less cops in the sydney metropolitan area than we did in 2003
3249733 these are figures supplied by the nsw police force in terms of actual police officers in nsw
3249734 were talking about the numbers of cops in the 46 area commands that make up the sydney basin
3249735 despite all of the government spin despite all of the comments that everything is fine in terms of policing in nsw these figures show there has been a steady decline in terms of police numbers in the sydney metropolitan area since the high point in 2003
3249736 he had a plate put in there the radius bone above the wrist to stabilise the affected area on monday and he will miss the remainder of the season

3249738 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3249739 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3249740 its quite possible that they will use this was support for their case but one cant determine that because a species is under less threat from extinction that its automatically okay to start hunting them
3249741 if this issue is as serious as it appears to be then we can solve it
3249742 but we cant solve it by being paralysed by all these parochial views
3249743 whats happening is that people who like natural gas over promote natural gas and overly criticise all the other ones
3249744 the people who like ethanol overly promote ethanol and overly criticise all the other ones
3249745 the next thing you know youve got all these people digging their heels in thinking theres a single answer and thats the only thing you should invest in
3249746 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3249747 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3249748 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3249749 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3249750 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3249751 i eagerly expect and hope that i will in no way be ashamed but will have sufficient courage so that now as always christ will be exalted in my body whether by life or by death

3249757 with her tremendous athletic ability and striking look we feel alison embodies the spirit and strength of lara croft
3249758 were excited to be working with her for the launch of tomb raider underworld and beyond and cant wait to see the reactions of tomb raider fans around the world to alisons uncannily realistic portrayal of lara
3249759 we found very little evidence of the superiority of unconscious thought for complex decisions
3249760 on the contrary our research suggests that unconscious thought is more susceptible to irrelevant factors such as how recently information has been seen rather than how important it is
3249761 drug use should be treated in the same way as alcohol and nicoteine sic which are both deadly drugs sold on shopping shelves and taxed to the hilt by every government
3249762 the worldwide web is an interesting beast and it provides great opportunity for information dissemination but also information distortion
3249763 that is policy nonsense to suggest wed be going there

3249781 i personally believe online casinos marketing practices of today that are thought of as inappropriate will be the future of tomorrows online casinos industry leaders
3249782 we need to stick to our guns and abide by best practice methods in order to preserve the integrity of the online casinos industry as a whole if we degrade ourselves by using cheap marketing practices to make a quick buck we will only be hurting ourselves in the long run
3249783 i truly believe that our customers not regulatory agencies are the best source of online casinos marketing feedback face it if were not making money and our customers are pissed off our marketing methods are wrong and not productive dont forget that private companies are in the business to make cash and dont make a profit banging their heads against the walls

3249812 si los guerrilleros eran apenas unos miles de qu guerra me habl s
3249813 est bien hubo una guerra pero las guerras tienen leyes y los militares no respetaron esas leyes
3249814 debemos afrontar el hecho de que la guerra moderna tal como la libran los nazis es una faena sucia no nos gusta no quisimos intervenir pero ahora ya entramos y vamos pelear con todo lo que tengamos
3249815 es claro que nuestra lucha ser larga y ser dura pero nosotros estaremos peleando en nuestro suelo y por nuestra tierra aprovechando para la guerra cada r o cada arroyo cada senda y cada quebrada que conocemos tanto esto ser una guerra de hombres una guerra de vida o muerte hasta que derrotemos a los amos de la tierra hasta que la tierra est en manos de los que la trabajan ya sean coyas criollos o matacos sean de la raza que sean
3249816 los nuestros nuestros hombres nuestros medios los de las organizaciones revolucionarias constituyen una peque a fuerza comparada a las que alistan las fuerzas armadas del r gimen
3249817 palabras de carlos olmedo jefe de las fuerzas armadas revolucionarias en un reportaje de diciembre de 1970 reproducido en
3249818 cuando nos lanzamos a la lucha lo hicimos con un gran romanticismo convencidos de que vencer amos eso nos dio fuerzas pero trajo aparejado un gran simplismo en el an lisis no s lo subestimamos a los militares tambi n nos falt capacidad para prever sus pasos y medir hasta d nde llegar an me siento orgullosa aunque perdimos la guerra porque tratamos hasta el ltimo momento de anteponer el hombre y sus ideales eso no nos hace superiores sino simple y profundamente diferentes de nuestros supuestos vencedores

3249821 desde que me separ de ustedes estuve siempre luchando en la clandestinidad siempre con las armas puestas y muchas veces con la polic a y los servicios de informaciones pis ndome los talones siempre obsesionado por la necesidad de golpear al enemigo y de extender la guerra he recorrido todo el pa s haciendo la guerra
3249822 pero ahora lo que quiero contarte es una historia de la que vos tambi n fuiste protagonista sos un hijo de la guerra tus padres te tuvieron entre el fragor de los combates en tiempos muy dif ciles para los revolucionarios anduviste de casa en casa en la clandestinidad y ocult ndote con ellos
3249823 nosotros creemos que en la argentina todo lo decisivo sucede en las ciudades de modo que hacemos la guerra en la ciudad aun siendo conscientes de sus limitaciones sabemos que en buenos aires que es una ciudad vasta y compleja con casi diez millones de habitantes no se puede tener un ej rcito integrado ni se pueden mantener zonas liberadas ni se pueden delimitar zonas de batallas espec ficas nuestro concepto es que se necesitan t cticas distintas para la ciudad y para el campo de acuerdo con las condiciones propias nosotros manejamos el concepto de guerra integral y la lucha electoral es tambi n parte de esa guerra por supuesto se trata de una participaci n t ctica nuestra propuesta de guerra integral es la m s amplia para la lucha de liberaci n o sea la lucha por todos los medios y en todos los planos
3249824 uno de los rasgos particulares de nuestra guerra revolucionaria es que el foco guerrillero no genera el movimiento de masas sino que ste lo precede en un cuarto de siglo montoneros es un ej rcito que tiene todas sus fuerzas dentro del territorio enemigo un ej rcito que se desarma todas las noches cuando sus militantes se van a dormir pero que sigue vivo e intacto mientras duerme cada uno en su casa
3249825 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3249826 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3249827 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3249828 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3249829 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3249830 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3249831 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3249832 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3249833 we found that qantas comes under fire from some media that clearly contradicts a more widespread view of qantas customers that voted for the airline in the survey

3249839 despite all of the government spin despite all of the comments that everything is fine in terms of policing in nsw these figures show there has been a steady decline in terms of police numbers in the sydney metropolitan area since the high point in 2003

3249847 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict he said following a crisis meeting with his national security team

3249852 this ground breaking discovery confirms what researchers and experts have believed for some time mitochondrial disease is not rare
3249853 we now know that 1 in 200 people carry the mutation for this horrible debilitating disease this discovery underscores the need for additional research funding to help better diagnose and treat affected individuals and to learn more about how mitochondrial dysfunction is connected to other diseases
3249854 the demonstration by dr chinnery and colleagues that at least one in 200 newborns harbor known pathogenic mitochondrial dna mutations indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction is a major underlying risk factor for human disease
3249855 this new observation augments the rapidly expanding body of evidence indicating that common mitochondrial dna lineages modulate the risk for developing a wide variety of diseases including diabetes cardiovascular disease parkinson disease alzheimer disease various cancers as well as longevity
3249856 dr chinnerys research raises many new questions none of which can be answered without additional dollars allocated for research into mitochondrial disease and dysfunction
3249857 this line of research holds great promise ultimately the investment we make may enable doctors and researchers to transform medicine benefiting not only those suffering from mitochondrial disease but the many millions of americans who suffer from the wide range of diseases related to mitochondrial dysfunction

3249939 you know i dont agree with any of this or with the way it is being done in fact i ruled in a previous case that to charge somebody with identity theft the person had to at least know of the real owner of the social security number

3249977 theres anything thats happened in the past 7 1 2 years that the u s needs to apologize for in terms of foreign policy
3249978 no i dont believe in the u s apologizing as i said i think the war in iraq was a mistake we didnt keep our eye on the ball in afghanistan but you know hindsight is 20 20 and im much more interested in looking forward rather than looking backwards
3249979 the invasion of afghanistan was as illegal as the invasion of iraq
3249980 the u n charter provides that all member states must settle their international disputes by peaceful means and no nation can use military force except in self defense or when authorized by the security council after the 9 11 attacks the council passed two resolutions neither of which authorized the use of military force in afghanistan
3249981 the invasion of afghanistan was not legitimate self defense under article 51 of the charter because the attacks on september 11 were criminal attacks not armed attacks by another country afghanistan did not attack the united states in fact 15 of the 19 hijackers came from saudi arabia furthermore there was not an imminent threat of an armed attack on the united states after september 11 or bush would not have waited three weeks before initiating his october 2001 bombing campaign the necessity for self defense must be instant overwhelming leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation this classic principle of self defense in international law has been affirmed by the nuremberg tribunal and the u n general assembly
3249982 iraq has been killed never to rise again the american occupation has been more disastrous than that of the mongols who sacked baghdad in the thirteenth century only fools talk of solutions now there is no solution the only hope is that perhaps the damage can be contained
3249983 its time to stop spending billions of dollars a week trying to put iraq back together and start spending the money putting america back together
