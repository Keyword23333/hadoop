4320014 weve had a good week done a lot of homework worked hard and the players are now preparing themselves mentally to be where they need to do
4320015 whatever they do is up to them but they have the responsibility to get there
4320016 the biggest challenge is sunday monday tuesday and the amount of preparation work

4320018 thats the biggest challenge weekly getting those days right and setting it up so the players can enter this period in the right space so they can get it right and unleash at newlands
4320019 i think it is a step up its a challenge to us to reach the level we did in auckland and surpass it thats what great teams do they consistently reach that level
4320020 there are a lot of doubters around who doubt the team has the heart to do it again but thats the challenge to take that level and intensity off shore and put it on the field at newlands

4320035 we know that the fraudulent activity is going on but its rare that we would find a location where those things are manufactured
4320036 what makes this case unique is we were led to where the man had rented a bedroom in a home and he had set up fraudulent manufacturing
4320037 to a trained professional we can see the flaws in them right away but to the average joe they look pretty good

4320211 i advocate federalism as a way to gain lasting peace in mindanao
4320212 this concentration of such enormous powers in manila has created only one center of finance and development in the country resulting in a highly centralized system of government
4320213 is the absence or utter lack of consultation of stakeholders including christian leaders indigenous peoples in mindanao and peace advocates themselves

4320217 surely the first foundation of righteousness is the worship of god
4320218 there is nothing more perilous to our salvation than a preposterous and perverse worship of god
4320219 experience teaches us how fertile is the field of falsehood in the human mind and that the smallest of grains when sown there will grow to yield an immense harvest
4320220 the mind of man i say is like a work place of idolatrie
4320221 every one of us is even from his mothers womb a master craftsman of idols
4320222 let us be thankful and so worship god acceptably with reverence and awe

4320228 touching the melody it has seemed best that it be moderated in the manner we have adopted to carry the weight and majesty appropriate to the subject and even to be proper for singing in the church
4320229 we all know from experience how great a power music has for moving mens feelings so that plato teaches quite rightly that in one way or another music is of the greatest value in shaping the moral tone of the state
4320230 it is not sufficient to utter the praises of god with our tongues if they do not proceed from the heart
4320231 the outward form of worship and the inward adoration of the heart must remain firmly joined together
4320232 i dont have to look very far to see someone worse off

4320271 many of us would rather watch a noisy demonstration of miracles signs and wonders than have a quiet bible study yet we are faced today with the sad reality that our untempered zeal is a sign of immaturity our adolescent craving for the wild and crazy makes us do stupid things its way past time for us to grow up

4320273 a prominent pentecostal evangelist called me this week after bentleys news hit the fan
4320274 im now convinced that a large segment of the charismatic church will follow the anti christ when he shows up because they have no discernment
4320275 i felt we had a great practice today an extension of what we had yesterday we got a chance to evaluate a lot of our people we got a chance to evaluate them under different conditions and we are very pleased
4320276 usually the second day is always that way it was the same way last year ive probably practiced with a different team seven or eight times since ive been in the national football league and it never changes that second day is usually a bit more competitive and we had some great work
4320277 zach is a great football player i think we all know zach thomas he practices at a certain level and thats why he plays at a certain level every time he hits that football field hes an experienced pro a guy i have always admired and he had a good practice today
4320278 i think both of those guys marshall and cowboys cb adam jones are just having fun there is a lot of respect level there by both guys just going out and competing brandon has a hard time staying quiet though after someone takes a shot at him i do know that
4320279 it wasnt a fight thats was just a little pushing that happens all the time but they kept their composure and they didnt swing thats what you want tempers are going to flare up a little bit thats the nature of this profession but they were professional enough to back off and players laugh at it and smile thats part of practicing against another team but there were no swings and thats what i appreciated two teams acted in a professional manner and hopefully we will have another good practice this afternoon
4320280 they get a chance to see what we are doing and we get a chance to see what they are doing there isnt a gameplan involved but you still want to go out and do a good job you still want to evaluate players as well if we were playing them in a regular season game obviously we wouldnt be practicing against them but thats not they key at this time of year its to try to find your best 53 man squad and also put your system in against other people i think we have had a productive day and a half
4320281 i cant tell you if hes going to play on saturday but its not serious
4320282 i think its a lot different romo was in a backup role i believe for four years if im not mistaken hes a student of the game when you run the scout team or if you are on a team as a quarterback and you have four years looking at different defenses its a little easier to go behind that center and read defenses jay is a little bit different he wasnt thrown in the fire right away in the first year it was a growing experience but there are a little bit more growing pains the quicker you get in romo is reading coverages unbelievably i admire how quickly he reads coverages and gets the ball to the right spot he is going to have a heck of a year you could see it out here today and yesterday
4320283 i see a difference just watching romo play last year he plays with a lot of confidence he knows where the ball is going and if something breaks down he has the ability to make a play on his own he can throw the ball at all different angles and he is a heck of a weapon
4320284 well he guaranteed 2 000 yards i think so he is going to be much better we have a long way to go though
4320285 as a team we had a little drop off but you know thats part of playing in the national football league we just got to be more consistent
4320286 basically i said yesterday that 21 is no champ bailey i thought about it for a moment today that since hes changed his name back to adam hes not even pac man hes not even as good as pac man used to be but its all in fun i explained to him that he needed to spice it up because im winning right now
4320287 im aiming for perfection and today i had a little drop off i had a few dropped balls and thats not like me i was kind of upset with myself im always trying to have a pro bowl day every day and today is not one of those days
4320288 yesterday was a little buddy buddy system going on but today was more intense and more physical we got after it today and it was pretty even
4320289 well when you see peyton manning come out and he sees different coverages whether its press or off coverage he changes it up as a defensive back in the nfl you make your money doing press coverage so i said lets go deep we went deep we went 100 percent going deep against pac man jones i mean adam sorry and we won
4320290 its exciting to be able to go against someone else and to be able to go out and compete against another team you got to motivate yourself a little more when you wake up every day going against the same guy today felt like game day a little bit
4320291 definitely when you are going against other guys guys that you are not friends with sometimes tempers flare
4320292 i really cant say what happened i guess two guys got into it a little extra at the end of the play once that happens your friends come and their friends come and pile on just grabbing pushing and tugging away
4320293 i guess yesterday people were feeling each other out we felt that we had the upper hand early in the morning yesterday and we knew they were going to come out with a higher intensity level and they did that we all came out and practiced hard today
4320294 definitely we do that with our own team sometimes when we go against our own team the defense will win and the offense will come out extra motivated because the coaches in the meetings are yelling at you and things like that it makes us want to come out and give that extra effort the next practice
4320295 its kind of hard to tell i am not a db so i am not staring at the quarterback most of the time most of the time i am on man coverage on somebody so i really cant tell you
4320296 he is a very strong runner his speed is a little bit deceptive he is a lot faster than people give him credit for he runs well inside the tackles and outside
4320297 i am just happy to be out there im playing will some downs and mike on others once you start to play linebacker it is really not that big of a difference

4320332 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4320333 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4320460 it atmosphere was a little different because it is kind of a home game for us but is so close to pittsburgh that a lot of pittsburgh fans drove to the game
4320461 i think its going to do well for the nfl
4320462 we have to get the crowd a little bit more into it and it happens with time
4320463 when the regular season comes its going to be different because the first team will be out there for the whole game
4320464 but to be up here with the fans has been awesome
4320465 its an exhibition game and in buffalo these are 60 tickets and they want 500 for them here
4320466 id definitely be selling more tickets if i was at a hockey arena
4320467 we need to understand that steve bracks made his recommendations prior to the collapse of doha round of world trade talks
4320468 it makes no sense at all given doha the collapse of world trade talks the global financial crisis and the issue of climate change to consider reducing tariffs
4320469 china india malaysia are not doing it and neither are canada and the european union
4320470 its only been 20 years roughly 20 odd years since that mine closed
4320471 it takes 20 30 40 years to come out the disease so for people to say its not dangerous or theres been no health problems associated with this mine well lets see down the track
4320472 successive state governments put enormous amounts of money into keeping the mine going when it was operating now its been closed for 25 years theres a clear obligation to secure the safety of the community
4320473 weve got to do a lot of engineering work two or two and a half years of engineering work design and environmental impact statements and that type of activity
4320474 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment

4320476 saya tidak tahu anda perlu bertanya kepada pihak yang mengendali kes ini untuk mendapat sebab dan jawapan yang tepat saya hanya menteri dalam negeri dan saya tidak terlibat dalam proses pendakwaan dan penyiasatan
4320477 jika kita mahu mengambil tindakan kita perlu melakukan siasatan bukan sewenang wenangnya bertindak perlu meneliti dari segenap aspek
4320478 jika tiada perkara seumpama itu berlaku kita hanya boleh memberi amaran agar mereka mengambil kira pandangan dan sensitiviti agama serta kaum lain
4320479 kita tidak mahu dalam apa juga konflik atau permasalahan islam dianggap sebagai punca sedangkan ia adalah masalah sejagat yang perlu diberi perhatian sama rata oleh semua pihak
4320480 saya fikir kalau kita bincang baik baik tak ada masalah jangan fokus kepada isu tertentu
4320481 you mean that you think you are a better player than jerry west
4320482 but if i were to play him i would believe that i would win while we were playing i just dont consider losing while the game is going on i always feel i am the best player on the field or court when i am playing
4320483 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia
4320484 the war games included a us navy supercarrier battle group an us navy expeditionary carrier battle group a royal navy carrier battle group a french nuclear hunter killer submarine plus a large number of us navy cruisers destroyers and frigates playing the
4320485 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
4320486 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4320487 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4320488 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
4320489 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
4320490 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4320491 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
4320492 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
4320493 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
4320494 i believe in jesus the bible god and so on are all relative and again are only orthodox within a given sect or denomination based on its creedal confession
4320495 when we came out of the pub all we could see was smoke coming out of the roof and within a matter of minutes flames were coming out there was loads of people coming out of the hotel but it didnt look like anyone was seriously injured the fire brigade were already here when we came out but more and more engines kept coming
4320496 we couldnt believe what we were seeing the flames could been seen from miles away it looked like the whole town centre was on fire the smoke and flames seemed to fill the sky
4320497 there were loads of firefighters running around when i got here it seemed like it was going to take a lot of them to bring it under control at one point it looked like they had put it out but the flames just started shooting out of the roof again
4320498 we are fighting the fire internally and externally there are two turntable ladders spraying water down on the building and ten appliances
4320499 our main aim is to stop the fire spreading to the cornmill shopping centre
4320500 the alarm went off at 12 30am at first we thought it was a false alarm as we had a drill last night then we realised it was for real
4320501 when we came out of the pub all we could see was smoke coming out of the roof and within a matter of minutes flames were coming out there was loads of people coming out of the hotel but it didnt look like anyone was seriously injured the fire brigade were already here when we came out but more and more engines kept coming
4320502 we couldnt believe what we were seeing the flames could been seen from miles away it looked like the whole town centre was on fire the smoke and flames seemed to fill the sky
4320503 there were loads of firefighters running around when i got here it seemed like it was going to take a lot of them to bring it under control at one point it looked like they had put it out but the flames just started shooting out of the roof again
4320504 i couldnt believe what i was seeing there was people everywhere just stood around watching what was going on a lot of the people who had come out of the hotel looked quite frightened many of them seemed to be from china or japan they didnt really know what was going on the police managed to move them to safety quite quickly
4320505 a and her husband are pulling out of that street

4320508 they come home midnight just to crawl into bed and leave soon after sunrise
4320509 you have lost your appetite and sleep id rather not have the house if it means losing you
4320510 the greater fear right now is missing the next big rally
4320511 inflation numbers were bad but they are probably going to get better
4320512 investors have different opinions as to what the value of those companies are given the tremendous difficulties they face
4320513 there has been a sufficient amount of pessimism to warrant a short term rally
4320514 the way to get drug abuse numbers to go down is to increase the perception of risk
4320515 its not a new phenomenon but its certainly an alarming one
4320516 if your child is abusing cough medicine its clearly a sign that somethings wrong
4320517 parents have so much power to help their kids make good choices
4320518 the campaign did not pledge any federal matching funds certifications as collateral for a bank loan
4320519 how do you train over a conference call there are way too many distractions
4320520 when elijah the prophet set out to discredit the false prophets of the idol baal he built an altar on mount carmel and sacrificed an ox there
4320521 i just wanted to make sure we didnt get lulled to sleep with the division slipping away a little bit
4320522 you can always come here dedicated to playing as hard as you can and i kind of laid that our there for them
4320523 you cant sit there and tell them hey were going to win this thing im not obviously saying we cant but sometimes expectations are so high and everything and see stuff slipping away you dont quite grind the way you probably need to grind i just wanted to remind them of that they did a great job thursday and i know they will the rest of the season
4320524 thats the edgar renteria ive known for all these years
4320525 at the same time its good to see us come from behind for whatever reason it hasnt been happening its not for a lack of effort though but we got it done its a good feeling
4320526 i wanted to keep the game tight and not give up a lot of runs
4320527 when we started scoring the five runs i was real happy thats what everyone was looking for
4320528 it was a tough call but like i said he deserved it and he got the ground ball
4320529 he just got deep in the pitch count so we had to go to the bullpen and we dont have the guys out there that we normally would have out there ready to go but thats going to happen sometimes frasor came in last night and did a great job for us today was a little different
4320530 i tried to come back and pound the zone with different pitches
4320531 in the past few months and particularly over the summer we have seen increasing signs that this parliament is really not working very well any more it is becoming increasingly dysfunctional
4320532 quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4320533 governing is more than not just being defeated in the house its also being able to pass legislation
4320534 this is the prime minister who made a virtue of passing fixed election date legislation and now hes threatening to cross sussex drive and go see his neighbour the governor general and ask for an election because hes fabricating a crisis where none exists
4320535 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4320536 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4320537 although im not sure anything will make some of them feel better
4320538 were not even halfway into the games right now and were a second half team
4320539 the combination of a larger inventory of homes for sale and fewer home sales means less upward pressure on home prices in many markets
4320540 the challenge for many sellers is determining the right price for todays market conditions
4320541 when the owner of the rogers centre whats his name when he went to bills owner ralph wilson and said ok we want to have the games what do you think they talked about
4320542 if you were a fly on the wall there what do you think they talked about
4320543 as much as i love coming to toronto and i love a lot of the people up here im going to do everything in my power to make sure the bills stay in buffalo
4320544 i wouldnt want to see anything jeopardize the cfl and what the toronto argonauts have done here and i wouldnt want to see anything happen with the buffalo bills
4320545 weve made a commitment to be here for the next five years and were excited about that its not just the pre season game
4320546 were here and this is the foundation of something special
4320547 neither jennifer nor i are admitting to being the wife
4320548 im looking for nathan to go from 20 something to 30 something points this season he is a dynamic player with excellent skills and plays big playing with chris margott this season hopefully his progression will continue and he can help pick up the slack
4320549 today there are no losers everyone is a winner and we were able to raise money for a great cause
4320550 make sure you work hard and plan well but if you dont dont worry because everything will work out in the end
4320551 to resolve the issue a team of researchers led by marcus munaf at the university of bristol in the uk conducted a controlled experiment they randomly assigned 84 heterosexual students to consume either a non alcoholic lime flavoured drink or an alcoholic beverage with a similar flavour the exact amount of alcohol varied according to the individual but was designed to have an effect equivalent to someone weighing 70 kilograms drinking 250 millitres of wine enough to make some students tipsy after 15 minutes the students were shown pictures of people their own age from both sexes
4320552 he was the first person i ever fought over maybe 22
4320553 i was real nervous im only 16 ive got no power i cant hold the guy i went in there and did my thing but i learned from it and it got me to where i am today
4320554 the heck with this now get in the batters box
4320555 to a weapon or component to qualify it to rejoin the weapons stockpile it is actually a physical stamp
4320556 we are pleased that weve been able to resolve these issues but i think one should not underestimate the challenge of stopping a production process and then many years later trying to resume it thats been tough
4320557 i cant discuss the details because it gets into classified weapons design issues id say it was some engineering issues that had to be sorted out
4320558 im not going to comment specifically on when we transported it
4320559 we have completed the first production unit for the w76
4320560 we had a technical issue that required a lot of support from other sites as well as drawing on a lot of expertise here at y 12
4320561 it involved reconstitution of an old process its quite challenging to reconstitute something you havent done in awhile
4320562 moms are the decision makers of the household as far as purchases are concerned
4320563 a free daily e mail from the front lines of fashion food and fun
4320564 i love women women are more than half the population and they do most of the shopping
4320565 we are constantly looking for more sites that cater to women
4320566 time and time again women are happy to see their relationship with their food their clothes and their relationships externally manifested in entertainment and how to content
4320567 its really raw and unfiltered not run through a committee of 12 people who need to approve what you say its the real deal
4320568 when elderly people complain theyre tired most doctors say yeah well youre old they tell their patients that feeling listless is an expected part of aging but there are reasons people are tired and they need to be investigated for clinicians the message from our study is that a lack of energy is widespread in the elderly but its not normal
4320569 i believe anergia is the universal language by which the elderly talk about their health problems
4320570 instead of noting symptoms of pain or a depressed mood many older adults feel more comfortable telling their physicians that they are tired as health care providers we need to start learning how to further identify the underlying causes of this lack of vigor and address them
4320571 as our population ages it has become paramount to the health of our nation to accurately describe the health problems associated with age
4320572 a central feature of the frailty phenotype that we described years ago is self reported exhaustion the current study suggests that this concern expressed by patients or their caregivers is important and may be a very useful question in identifying older adults susceptible to functional decline and poor health outcomes
4320573 p r o d u c t i o n s
4320574 the battering of consumers continues as prices are rising for just about everything
4320575 it is certainly above expectations here but i think weve probably seen for the near term anyway the worst of the inflation readings
4320576 it will take some time for the economy to turn around but we are confident in the long term fundamentals and underlying strength of our economy to get us through this period
4320577 families have now lost an entire decades worth of raises to inflation
4320578 this bike is a design from deep inside my mind and they tell me it must be a scary place since we also build street rods i was looking for a sleek fluid line like we do for those cars so the bike was influenced by that style it just made sense to call it under the influence

4320594 ive been in china since my last race so im ready
4320595 you know everyone is looking at the 100 metres and its going to be stiff but last year was stiff too and we all know what happened so i cant worry about the competition i just have to go out there and do what i need to do and i will be successful
4320596 well i just keep to myself there are a lot more heads out there than those two who could be a threat but i dont think it will be any different im just going to go out there and run a good 100 metres and hopefully come out on top
4320597 everyone is looking to go out there and represent their country well and i am looking to do the same thing
4320598 i want to be the first 100 metre runner from the bahamas to bring home a gold medal in the olympics
4320599 the most prestigious event in the olympics in the world is the 100 metres to bring a gold medal home would be priceless
4320600 im looking forward to wearing my colours and just going out there and competing
4320601 hopefully i could put a perfect race together when it counts i believe its going to be aqua aqua gold and black this is my time to shine and im going to do it for the bahamian people
4320602 i feel like i just need to know what to do at certain phases of my race once i execute the way i want to i will be hard to beat i know that i am definitely gunning for a pb personal best and hopefully that pb can drive me to a gold medal
4320603 its been an up and down season but i ended my last race with a 10 02 so that is good motivation going into the olympics
4320604 they have done the right thing and put their intentions in
4320605 i have staked my countrys fate on the wests rhetoric about democracy and liberty
4320606 isnt the point of collective defence to make it clear to any potential aggressor that force will be met with force so clear as to prevent the initial use of force from ever arising
4320607 mark is a presence in any lineup and he gives us incredible depth
4320608 through may and june we averaged 31 2 runs a game and we were able to win because of our rotation and bullpen but you cant go through the whole season scoring 31 2 runs a game

4320620 it seems like its just been an attack on our receiving corps
4320621 theyre the ones dictating how defenses play us because if you dont get down there and load the box youre going to have a hard time slowing our guys down
4320622 i may want to and i may get bigger numbers but ideally were probably hurting ourselves if im a starter you really want me to be in the slot and have the bigger receivers on the outside
4320623 i want them back on the field but i want them back and healthy i dont want them rushing back
4320624 i saw a lot when porter was healthy we definitely have a no 1 guy in him
4320625 when he comes back 100 he will make a difference i have all the confidence in the world in him getting back and being a productive no 1receiver

4320639 the teacher must be reprimanded given a warning or even sacked to send a message that this behaviour is not tolerable
4320640 the detrimental remark and racist slur is something unbecoming of a teacher but it is happening in a number of places
4320641 i urge the education ministry to send a strong message to irresponsible teachers because the teachers send their children to teachers with respect and belief that they would be taken care of
4320642 mic youth will send the memorandum urging the education ministry to take appropriate action and not send the teacher to a better school which has been seen as a form of promotion
4320643 the ministry has to act sternly and swiftly in order to cool down the angry responses from the indian community
4320644 given this shouldnt the education minister say something about the entire episode which has not only traumatised the students but also deeply hurt the feelings of the indian community at large
4320645 the minister must do what is right by the indian community by not appearing to close an eye to the teachers uncalled for behavior
4320646 it has also been brought to our attention that similar abuse is being leveled against students in a primary school in taman klang jaya
4320647 a transfer would not teach her a lesson it is almost as if she escaped unscathed
4320648 in fact she should be sacked and we fail to understand why the ministry is viewing this matter so lightly the indian community is unhappy over this
4320649 the teacher must be reprimanded given a warning or even sacked to send a message that this behaviour is not tolerable
4320650 the detrimental remark and racist slur is something unbecoming of a teacher but it is happening in a number of places
4320651 i urge the education ministry to send a strong message to irresponsible teachers because the teachers send their children to teachers with respect and belief that they would be taken care of
4320652 mic youth will send the memorandum urging the education ministry to take appropriate action and not send the teacher to a better school which has been seen as a form of promotion
4320653 the ministry has to act sternly and swiftly in order to cool down the angry responses from the indian community
4320654 given this shouldnt the education minister say something about the entire episode which has not only traumatised the students but also deeply hurt the feelings of the indian community at large
4320655 the minister must do what is right by the indian community by not appearing to close an eye to the teachers uncalled for behavior
4320656 isnt this serious enough for the minister to intervene what else is he waiting for

4320669 todos los presidentes venezolanos han citado a bol var pero actualmente hay un nuevo proyecto nacional y una constituci n que a ade el adjetivo de bolivariano por considerar que el libertador representa las m s preciadas virtudes republicanas
4320670 antes bol var era igual a patria pero ch vez ha convertido el bolivarianismo y el chavismo en sin nimos hace una metamorfosis del mito para que se parezca a l y a lo que sus seguidores piensan
4320671 del bol var para todos al bol var para ch vez
4320672 el culto a bol var es un hecho consumado entre nosotros todos los mandatarios han hecho uso de bol var no es pues un hecho novedoso ni alarmante su utilizaci n indiscriminada para los fines m s diversos
4320673 ch vez manipulando a bol var se atribuye poderes que nadie le ha concedido y no respeta el resultado de un refer ndum
4320674 si esta rep blica se llama bolivariana y finalmente el libertador ya no es una figura usada por las elites sino que se ancla en el pueblo me parece una consecuencia natural y l gica que muchas de las acciones de este proyecto nacional de izquierda lleven el adjetivo bolivariano
4320675 antes la figura de bol var se usaba como herramienta para unir y ahora ch vez lo usa para dividir a la sociedad lo usa como arma de guerra un arma dif cil de combatir porque los venezolanos no podemos renegar del dolo para renegar as de ch vez

4320697 knowing exactly where to point at just the right time was critical to this event
4320698 the challenge is equivalent to trying to capture a sharp unsmeared picture of a distant roadside billboard with a telephoto lens out the window of a speeding car
4320699 enceladus was streaking across the sky so quickly that the spacecraft had no hope of tracking any feature on its surface our best option was to point the spacecraft far ahead of enceladus spin the spacecraft and camera as fast as possible in the direction of enceladus predicted path and let enceladus overtake us at a time when we could match its motion across the sky snapping images along the way
4320700 there appears to have been extensive fallout of icy particles to the ground along some of the fractures even in areas that lie between two jet source locations though any immediate effects of presently active jets are subtle

4320708 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4320709 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4320710 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4320711 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4320712 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4320713 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4320714 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4320715 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4320716 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4320770 writers keep writing about the cold dark place within the water under a frozen lake or the secluded camoflaged hole the light they shine on this hole this pit helps us cut away or step around the brush and brambles then we can dance around the rim of the abyss holler into it measure it throw rocks in it and still not fall in it can no longer swallow us up and we can get on with things
4320771 what do you think the root of all evil is
4320772 because from morality stems the concept and essence of evil from there came the rules of what should be good and bad according the people who made them rules that otherwise force people to judge to be prejudiced and ultimately to do the very things that are evil for the sake of removing what they think is evil
4320773 then why not fault that to religion where morality stems from in the first place
4320774 probably because religion was a good idea the rules that came with it however was a very bad one

4320805 while cable will remain the regions leading pay tv platform the satellite subscriber base is eating into its dominance satellites much higher arpu levels mean it will exceed cable in revenue terms during 2009

4320808 if you think there is a glass ceiling you will probably find it if not the sky is the limit
4320809 the industry would like to see support for more ginnie mae staff
4320810 they need to have an ability to respond to what is an unprecedented demand for their products
4320811 we dont know how much higher this volume spike is going to get
4320812 they need to have the staff to send teams on site
4320813 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
4320814 theyre definitely committed to building everything is still going ahead as planned theyre just not doing it in 2008
4320815 theyre doing what everyone else is doing theyre going to wait a little bit and see its the same at a lot of different projects
4320816 do we seriously need to have this stupid fucking football argument all the goddamn time
4320817 this has quietly and insidiously grown into a big problem
4320818 its not a creepy guy in an overcoat pushing drugs this is about medications that are in your home prescription drugs are the drug of choice for teens who are trying drugs for the first time they are getting drugs from their parents or their grandparents medicine cabinets
4320819 more and more they are coming in strung out on prescription pill opiates
4320820 teenagers and young people across the country can often get dangerous drugs on the internet
4320821 we need to stop it and this bill would be a major step forward
4320822 you can get addicted anytime but the two most vulnerable times are adolescence and old age
4320823 a lot of parents arent very aware often they are the last to know many parents dont get their teens to us until their senior year of high school then they lament not bringing them in when they are 15 or 16
4320824 they tend to forget the pills are in there or they feel they paid for them and dont want to toss them
4320825 its an invitation if a teenager is looking for drugs teenagers are prone to experimentation and having the medication in the home makes it easier because it is free we need to make parents more accountable to their medications when you are done with them throw them out
4320826 preventing substance abuse among teens is primarily a mom and pop operation
4320827 it is inexcusable that there are so many problem parents who dont try harder who fail to appropriately monitor their children on school nights fail to keep dangerous prescription drugs out of their reach and tolerate drug infected schools for their children
4320828 in this time period command wore gold engineers wore red
4320829 for fifty bucks id put my face in their soup and blow
4320830 the violations that we are aware of seem to date back many years
4320831 no strategy for american security is complete without a plan to end americas dependence on mideast oil today the american economy depends on oil controlled by some of the worlds most repressive regimes this leaves our economy dangerously vulnerable to nations that do not share our interests america too often is silent about the practices of some governments because we depend on oil they control
4320832 john kerry john edwards and the democratic party believe a strong america must no longer rely on the cooperation of regimes that do not share our values we believe a strong america must move toward energy independence
4320833 provide a tax cut for working families barack obama has called on the president to enact a second round of economic stimulus to immediately put tax rebates in the pockets of american families to pay for rising energy prices
4320834 as new large oil importing nations come on the market the united states is at the mercy of an ever more volatile oil market obama believes we should use existing organizations like nato to make energy security a shared global goal we should take steps to engage the largest new consumers china and india including by inviting them to join the international energy agency
4320835 i cant believe he did it this is amazing im so happy i can only jump up and down
4320836 the first thing i thought of was my parents and my coach
4320837 we are proud descendants of the great ghengis khan and tuvshee proved the strength of mongolians in the olympics
4320838 it is so exciting that our mongolian flag was raised in beijing and tuvshee won in the judo competition
4320839 me and several of my friends have bought mongolian vodka to celebrate this wonderful news it is going to be a very exciting night
4320840 right after the june 29 election we were in central square protesting election results and throwing stones against policemen and interior troops this time we are all here to cheer and support our athletes participating in beijing olympics
4320841 we never even considered the possibility they would do it before we asked
4320842 they certainly decided it was important enough on their own
4320843 utter deference to the executive to decide what it wanted and to do what it wanted and to violate the law
4320844 hes long said he wants an apology an acknowledgment of what they did and why they sent him to syria and he wants to make sure it doesnt happen to anybody else
4320845 lol xd i feel bad for you but maybe theres not a lot of space left on the computer
4320846 my room still has a lot of superfluous junk cluttering it up
4320847 so yeah you used to say that paramore was pretty annoying p
4320848 obviously you havent seen my room lately oh and that superfluous junk its called shit
4320849 consumers are taking more mass transit carpooling and buying fuel efficient cars
4320850 and that combined with a stronger u s dollar have helped to force down oil and therefore gas prices
4320851 its not worth the hassle of owning a car in the city i save at least a couple hundred bucks a month not owning a car
4320852 though some analysts might disagree we at aaa think it would take a significant drop in prices for people to revert back
4320853 a form of state support for an environmentally and economically harmful activity designed to consolidate existing price support mechanisms for vested interest groups most notably farmers
4320854 it is clear that a european biofuel industry cannot be viable without political support by means of tariffs and very high levels of subsidy
4320855 other green products which should be subject to similar tax and tariff incentives include insulation condensing boilers water management systems and heat exchangers
4320856 a vehicle for delivering covert industrial subsidies to politically favoured industries on a truly epic scale
4320857 we consider that the most cost effective way of reducing carbon emissions is to introduce an economy wide carbon price and that the best way of doing this would be to abandon the ets and to tax the consumption of primary fuels in proportion to their carbon content
4320858 even as gas prices have doubled and trebled over the past several years we see little change in driving behavior
4320859 so whats the point the point is to make a splash
4320860 my clients experience suggests they brought an indictment without careful evaluation of the evidence
4320861 they essentially took out the entire organization in one fell swoop
4320862 were pleased with the ruling and will proceed forward as appropriate
4320863 i disapprove of all this affection its entirely too huggy around here
4320864 i think youll find that this is the real deal

4321090 but aside from the many customer wins we were also very pleased to see that the existing customer base continuously expands the scope of their dataminer network management platforms
4321091 today dataminer is one of the most widely deployed open multi vendor network management platforms in the industry and it is continuously gaining momentum mainly based on its merits as being a very open powerful and yet still intuitive and easy to use solution with a very appealing total cost of ownership tag
4321092 dataminer is a state of art multi vendor network management platform and dataminer cube underlines our commitment to our customers and business partners that they will continue to dispose of the best that technology can offer to some people it may come as a bit of a surprise that we went back to the drawing board as our current generation of uis is already ranked at the top but this is all about being prepared for the future and assuring that our customers can continue to operate more and more efficiently even while their technical ecosystems become more and more complex while preserving the qualities of the existing ui and by leveraging the latest technologies dataminer cube embodies an entirely new highly innovative and above all user centric approach on the end to end management of complex technological ecosystems we spent a massive amount of resources in researching ui techniques and scrutinizing the seemingly most trivial aspects and it has paid off you need to experience dataminer cube in order to fully comprehend what it is all about but dataminer cube is truly going to change the way people look at managing the most complex ecosystems and ibc2008 is a unique opportunity for operators to get a sneak preview
4321093 los gemelos son musculos igual que los biceps trabajarlos a altas reps es una falacia
4321094 i came in and there were police officers outside they handed me a leaflet saying dont be worried theyre just looking into the neighbourhood there have been three terror arrests
4321095 it was quite hard to see which houses because there were crowds of people outside and two police cars and a van its really worrying that its so close its like oh my god who is it you cant believe its actually happening on your street in your community
4321096 the majority of our community here are kashmiri we have never had any problems and have a very good relationship with the kashmiri community and have done so for a very long time
4321097 this has had no effect on the airport it is a total police operation and we didnt even know that it had happened until afterwards
4321098 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned
4321099 however these types of inquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve i would ask local residents to be patient with us and to be assured that we will keep them updated in relation to the investigation as and when we can
4321100 subjected to the sort of obscenities you wouldnt want a 6 year old to hear

4321116 and there were no differences on those measures in the alcohol group compared to the no alcohol group
4321117 this suggests that the effect we observed wasnt due to a general change in mood
4321118 someone on trial for there life is like attending a roman carnival
4321119 and most importantly for licenses such as the gpl it means that your rights to use the copyrighted work at all disappear

4321137 i just said i was going to visit family in quiche
4321138 at the first military checkpoint i gave them candy to stop crying my story was that these were my children and we were returning from visiting family in quiche
4321139 es dificil a encontrarlos en las ma anas entonces tienen un poco frio
4321140 i should have asked her to teach me how to tortillar first before i began learning to make chuchitos
4321141 i said dont throw away that peel i want to use it
4321142 i think it shows just as much character that theyve gone through the training to help others
4321143 i know i can say for most of us its really about god
4321144 she always stood right at the front when anything like that was going on
4321145 the sky was blood red from the flames for three whole days
4321146 we the undersigned have written down the following in order to bear witness of the fascists bestiality on 5th april a number of graves were excavated where jews were buried who had been killed in a bestial manner in all 21 graves were found each one being 4m to 5m long and 1m wide each grave contains 10 to 12 people victims of shots in the neck using firearms or machine pistols the murdered people were very emaciated an examination of their bodies revealed many bloodshot and blue areas on their skins apparently they had been hit with sticks and rubber clubs prior to being shot the inhabitants say that on 24 march these people had to dig their own graves and were shot immediately afterwards
4321147 200 jewish forced labourers from hungary who were murdered on 24 march 1945
4321148 dont look for the jews bones look for the gold that they buried
4321149 new zealands response on this issue should be a source of embarrassment
4321150 we feel weve discharged our obligations to the international community in the steps weve taken and that we will now only respond if we are given something far more substantial than individual names
4321151 new zealand was the only anglo saxon democracy which faced this problem and chose to ignore it
4321152 there was absolutely no political will to take legal action against the nazi war criminals who emigrated to new zealand in the late 1940s and early 1950s posing as refugees fleeing communism
4321153 by the time that i found these people many were no longer alive
4321154 but one who was alive and living in auckland was jonas pukas a lithuanian who served in the 12th lithuanian auxiliary police battalion which murdered tens of thousands of jews in lithuania and belarus
4321155 passports have been returned for all of them but no reason has been given as to why they had been taken
4321156 and we spoke to the zimbabwean officials who assured us that they will allow them to travel

4321158 we are a traditional school with traditional values and we think we offer an education of a high standard which gives our students all the chances they need to succeed
4321159 we run quite a tight regime and students who want to come to us must attend for the whole week all day every day
4321160 its not like a college where you can just drift in and out we have had a really very good cohort of bright hard working young people this year fifteen out of our 97 candidates achieved four or more a grades
4321161 its been a good year for us there is a lot of talk about girls achieving so well at gcse but i think our boys can hold their own at a level
4321162 the investigation into the murders of benjamin and catherine mullany has been ongoing this morning two females appeared before the chief magistrates at st johns court having been arrested and charged with offences connected to the murders at this stage we are not in a position to disclose any further information as the inquiry continues however further information will be provided in due course

4321166 toads of glory slugs of joy sang groin the dwarf as he trotted jovially down the path before a great dragon ate him because the author knew that this story was a train wreck after he typed the first few words
4321167 like a mechanic who forgets to wipe his hands on a shop rag and then goes home hugs his wife and gets a grease stain on her favorite sweater love touches you and marks you forever
4321168 we are pleased overall but there is much more work to do
4321169 to bring students to grade level as many low income and minority students still lag behind academically
4321170 we did a good bit of revision in instruction looking at reinforcement of basic skills
4321171 at the current pace without significant intervention it would take 40 years for all of our eleventh graders to meet state standards
4321172 provide a rigorous curriculum regardless of where the student lives
4321173 not good enough not fast enough far far too many kids are not getting the quality of education they need
4321174 there is no place for complacency here yet that is what we find everywhere
4321175 they have responded very well they have taken greater ownership over their own education thats really exciting
4321176 were doing a great job and we will continue to get better
4321177 we say each individual child has to be accounted for and when a child is not getting it we say what are we going to do about it
4321178 it was amazing it was completely wood framing on top of masonry and it went up like a match
4321179 it goes without saying that the resident comfort and security is our no 1 priority
4321180 come join dr denny and his colleagues for our ongoing seminar series

4321182 lookadet holy shet that is so cooel look how fast iz going
4321183 sen obama believes that one of the principal problems facing the economy today is the lack of discretionary income for middle class wage earners
4321184 thats why his plan would not raise any taxes on couples making less than 250 000 a year nor on any single person with income under 200 000 not income taxes capital gains taxes dividend or payroll taxes
4321185 the reality of barack obamas record is the following he has voted to raise taxes 94 times in his short time as a senator
4321186 barack obama can say it but it doesnt make it true
4321187 the opinion piece that we saw today in the wall street journal is part of a path that obamas taking which takes him back more towards the middle more towards mccains policies
4321188 were pleased to see that because there is tremendous uncertainty over obamas plans for the economy and for the stock market and for the markets overall

4321244 only research in these six fields can receive funding in the ibsa framework
4321245 not everything in s amp t that is developed between the three countries is automatically an ibsa project but trilateral r amp d cooperation is possible in many other areas however it would be have to be funded outside the ibsa framework
4321246 for instance in november 2007 south africa hosted a workshop on nanotechnology which was attended by 12 scientists from india 6 scientists from brazil and 40 scientists from south africa including postgraduate students from universities and universities of technology
4321247 back in the reagan years the national endowment for democracy was created as a cold war tool today the ned is a neocon controlled agent for us world hegemony its main function is to pour us money and election rigging into former constituent parts of the soviet union in order to ring russia with american puppet states
4321248 the neoconservative bush regime used the ned to intervene in ukrainian and georgian internal affairs in keeping with the neoconservative plan to establish us friendly and russia hostile political regimes in these two former constituent parts of russia and the soviet union
4321249 during the late 1970s there was new thinking at the highest levels of the u s foreign policymakers and they reconsidered whether these ugly murderous military dictatorships of the 1970s were really the best way to preserve u s interests in these countries
4321250 this new thinking led to the establishment in 1983 of the national endowment for democracy they had chosen the german pattern in which the major political parties in germany have foundations financed by the federal government they did more or less the same thing with the establishment of the ned as a private foundation there is really nothing private about it and all its money comes from the congress
4321251 a lot of what we ned do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the cia
4321252 from my perspective and in my own opinion open source software has enjoyed security through lack of widespread adoption
4321253 copyright holders who engage in open source licensing have the right to control the modification and distribution of copyrighted material
4321254 the court has held that free licences such as the creative commons or cc licences set conditions rather than covenants on the use of copyrighted work
4321255 when you violate the condition the licence disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer this is the theory of the gpl general public license and all cc licences put precisely whether or not they are also contracts they are copyright licences which expire if you fail to abide by the terms of the licence
4321256 the gpl is another example of a licence that depends on copyright law for enforcement because its a copyright licence not a contract although this model train case is about a different licence because the us is a legal system based in part on case law every decision matters
4321257 the provincial government has sent every british columbian a cheque for 100 as a one time climate action dividend the total cost of climate action dividend is 440 million this expenditure will be paid for by b c s new carbon tax of 2 4 cents per litre of gasoline and other fuel do you agree or disagree with this expenditure
4321258 the british columbia experience suggests that segregating carbon revenue in a trust fund and returning all of it to individuals through automatic monthly dividends as james hansen and others have proposed is the best way to sustain political support
4321259 first of all it is the right thing to do for the planet
4321260 no 2 is the corporate responsibility bank of america is one of the leading corporations in the world including profitability we feel it is our responsibility to set an example for others to follow and show it can be done this also causes the advancement of technologies used in green engineering
4321261 this benefit began as a pilot in 2006 in l a boston and charlotte and was so well received internally that last year we expanded it to all associates company wide
4321262 most travel books about africa open with the author alone carried along by some vehicle looking down over some landscape and feeling anxious almost invariably books of this genre start with airplances or ships
4321263 every travel book employs the insidious device of the writer peering down through the airplane window and seeing this or that land which is always made to look otherworldly
4321264 di negeri inilah tertubuhnya hizbul muslimin pada 1948 di maahad ihya as syarif gunung semanggol
4321265 di sini jugalah pada 1955 pas mula mengenal erti demokrasi pilihan raya setelah wakil rakyat pertama iaitu tuan guru ahmad tuan hussein yang bertanding memenangi kerusi majlis undangan persekutuan krian
4321266 di perak jugalah dewan ulamak pas ditubuhkan secara rasmi di batu 20 bagan datoh pada 1957
4321267 marilah kita memperteguh dan memacu jamaah kita berhadapan dengan pelbagai jenis cabaran yang akan sentiasa ada di hadapan kita
4321268 kita juga sama sama mengikhlaskan niat dan amal perbuatan kita semata mata kerana allah untuk melaksanakan tugas dan amanah yang amat berat di muka bumi ini
4321269 je ne voulais pas partir sur quelque chose de mauvais mais quand jai vu que j tais 4e aux 50m javais encore moins de chances ce nest pas la fin de sa carri re mais jai besoin de temps jesp re que je mettrai moins de temps que je ne le pense pour reprendre du plaisir
4321270 i dont like to do that because it doesnt teach anything
4321271 whats the deal with mens and womens air pistol and all the gun events
4321272 there are something like 20 medals in shooting i guess people have guns
4321273 here you have one of the most popular sports in the world
4321274 we have the better case the sport has olympic level popularity now
4321275 what most people dont realize is that the vote to remove baseball happened at singapore in 2001
4321276 its not about getting major leaguers its very important to understand that at the time they did not put another sport in its place it does give an indication that they are prepared to re address the matter
4321277 50 percent of the ioc members are in europe and europe dominates the olympics agenda no doubt about it we want them to know it is a good sport that draws and has done well
4321278 its a huge event that finishes one week before the ioc makes its decision and that was not coincidental
4321279 eight or 10 sports would be out if you applied the same criteria that the ioc applied to baseball
4321280 they havent kicked track and field out despite what happened to marion jones
4321281 if not an issue its an excuse we are tainted there is no question even though mlb is independent from the ibaf we are being tarnished by a situation we have no control over history has shown that there have been some issues and you cant ignore them
4321282 those of us involved in running that event would stand to gain from the absence of baseball in the olympics but none of us feels that way not playing in the olympics would be a real unfortunate blow to millions of people around the world
4321283 we have to explore that its not entirely clear to me that the absence of talent is the reason countries around the world just dont understand how popular baseball is
4321284 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4321285 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4321286 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4321287 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4321288 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4321289 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4321290 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4321291 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4321292 how do i kill sin in my life how do i do it
4321293 all right how do i do that i agree that the power is there thats the bent of my life thats the way i am going i want to see the spirit do more and more of it how do i get to that point how do i gain that victory how do i establish that habitual pattern what do i do
4321294 if you dont know what you are shooting at how are you going to hit it
4321295 search me o god and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me
4321296 my heart is fixed o god my heart is fixed
4321297 he who pleads with god for the remission of sin also pleads with his own heart to detest it
4321298 i want you to reveal my sin i want you to stir it up in me i want you to show it to me i want you to blow away the dust that is covering it i want you to peel off the things that have been hiding it away in my life so that it becomes manifest and visible to me i want to see the reality of my sin i want you to show it to me just the way it is
4321299 god show me all the sins of my life reveal all of them uncover every little corner of my life bring it up and may it become as detestable to me as it is to you may i never do that again and may you give me the strength to see it go away
4321300 are you sensitive to sin in the church are you sensitive to sin in the world does it tear your heart up when you see sin around you any where in your own life
4321301 oh and for those of you who are curious about big babys progress he is on day 3 of the diet and no one has been murdered yet
4321302 throughout this experiment i also have to be aware that john actually has a life a family and full time school
4321303 akeena solar outlined this better than i ever could in this if you go to solar conferences especially conferences in the us south west and california theyll show you these beautiful nrel direct normal irradiance dni maps
4321304 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4321305 hey this could be a good opportunity i mean what better time to get involved in the sector if carbon markets blow up or the right legislation comes into play i might just be in an ideal position
4321306 thats for the scientists and policy makers to figure out ive got to meet my quarterly targets
4321307 reagan administration believed that the responsibility for commercializing conservation and alternative energy technologies rested with the private sector and that high oil prices would be ample encouragement for the development of alternative energy resources
4321308 energy conservation in the united states understanding its role in climate policy
4321309 the experience with energy efficiency policies and programs in iea countries
4321310 the high costs of federal energy efficiency standards for residential appliances
4321311 international comparison of depreciation rules and tax rates for selected energy investments
4321312 temporary investment tax incentives theory with evidence from bonus depreciation
4321313 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
4321314 the results are actually highly dependent on the surface chemistry
4321315 in other words you dont get this result just by attaching drugs to any nanotubes
4321316 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumor
4321317 but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumor which should further enhance the treatment efficacy
4321318 all that soil out there are plants that grew 6 000 years ago and didnt decompose completely
4321319 thats what peat is so were just making the same thing happen that happened here for millennia
4321320 we were capturing a lot of carbon dioxide at levels much greater than other systems marshes and forests grasslands
4321321 they can just sit back and watch the tules grow and they should be making money
4321322 thats what the vision is its not to do it just on twitchell island its to see if we can do it throughout the delta on subsided land
4321323 when oxygen is limited the bugs the microbes have to eat and breathe somehow
4321324 they will use sulfate iron or some other compound instead of producing carbon dioxide at the end of the pathway they end up producing methane
4321325 we chose young children to attend the event this year because we wanted to educate the future of this town children are much easier to teach and more likely to learn through their participation hopefully these young people will learn how a clean environment can truly improve their lives they can also learn how to protect their homes and city from rubbish and pollution
4321326 im sure i can theres an adjustment for some other thing
4321327 because we want to see this special cave in its natural light the artificial lights will make thien cung less beautiful
4321328 to many power boats on the bay anchoring next to beautiful caves i saw much black boat smoke and waste from the tourist boat it will have a bad impact on the heritage site
4321329 many of the technologies that are influencing medicine as it relates to the brain and spinal cord involve nanotechnology and hosting this conference at cnsi is an opportunity to stimulate discussion and fortify our relationship with a cutting edge field
4321330 cnsi has been built entirely on the spirit of multidisciplinary cooperation among engineers clinicians and basic scientists we share this vision with ibmisps and are delighted to host this event to spur a lively and thought provoking discussion
4321331 ptsd and tbi are prescient topics as more and more veterans return from war in need of effective treatments
4321332 officials from the department of defense which has earmarked 300 million this summer for ptsd and tbi research will be exchanging ideas and comparing notes with world class scientists and surgeons to explore unconventional approaches to these significant health care issues
4321333 improved neurosurgical techniques and tools for neuroimaging and brain mapping are required for treating medical challenges such as neurodegenerative diseases and inoperable brain cancer
4321334 the discovery process toward breakthrough therapies will be significantly accelerated through multidisciplinary research and innovation thus it is my sincere hope that the interaction of world class scientists gathered at this congress will expand the realm of possibilities for each researcher and promote cross disciplinary collaboration
4321335 we are pleased to have been able to build on our great partnership with the ualbany nanocollege to expand the opportunities available to our students in nanoscience and to have provided opportunities for students in other capital region school districts to benefit from the great resource that the nanocollege is to our community
4321336 the ualbany nanocollege is delighted to have been able to provide students from across the capital region with a unique and unparalleled look at the exciting world of nanotechnology through the inaugural excelsior scholars nanoscale science summer institute the strategic partnership between cnse and the city school district of albany has given school districts from across the region the opportunity to share in this pioneering educational paradigm that provides students a firsthand look at nanoscale science and engineering the field that will shape their careers in the future
4321337 its great but its awkward too im used to giving people things not accepting them
4321338 bo is a very modest person and low keyed guy but his dedication to boxing and the tremendous leadership by example that he provides as a long time member of ring 44 is a great continuance of the prestige that he and previous award winners contribute to the history of the prize
4321339 boxing people are a special breed of people who have a great deal of respect for one another
4321340 what gives me the most satisfaction is the appreciation of people when i repair a photo of their fighter or i do a collage of a familys fight history or just give someone a piece of fighting history that interests them
4321341 getting the data out of the device and into the control system usually uses proprietary software that is not interoperable across platforms
4321342 buktikan apa demokrasi bisa memberikan kesejahteraan dan yang paling utama adalah apakah bisa memberikan ridha allah kepada negara yang mengusung demokrasi itu
4321343 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4321344 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4321345 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4321346 if someone wants to discuss changes to that theyre going to have to bring that up with us
4321347 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4321348 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4321349 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4321350 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4321351 has been very very difficult for the city and for the state
4321352 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4321353 hes our player and he wanted to play in the game and we think hes mentally tuned into it so thats all that matters
4321354 i wouldnt be particularly sure until the transfer deadline passes what might materialise so well see
4321355 we kind of call it the new york city problem
4321356 would have to be priced based on the date of the actual board agreement or there could be an accounting charge
4321357 advised mr jobs that the board would have to confirm its prior approval in a legally satisfactory method
4321358 fred relied on these statements by mr jobs and from them concluded the grant was being properly handled
4321359 well i will see you in a few days these things come in threes you know
4321360 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4321361 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4321362 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

4321369 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4321370 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4321371 the price of crude oil has fallen some 30 a barrel in less than a month that drop is now translating into big cuts at your local gas station
4321372 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4321373 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4321374 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4321375 this is my city i will never leave it even if the russians come here and kill me why should i go to tbilisi and wait for them there
4321376 the philosophy of materialism holds that the only things that can be truly proven to exist is matter fundamentally material composes all things and all phenomena are the result of material interactions therefore matter is the only substance and can neither be created or destroyed hence we are all made of only what came before us yet discretely conceived through form we are all made of earth and sky and stars

4321380 stuff is happening so fast you cant take a play off the pace keeps you on your toes the ball could come to you every play
4321381 den dfb vorschlag k nnen wir nicht akzeptieren ich gehe davon aus dass grafite nicht f r die bundesliga gesperrt wird
4321382 was er an den dfb gemeldet hat und was tats chlich passiert ist steht nicht im einklang
4321383 das haben die palermo spieler nicht gesehen unsere spieler nicht und die trainer nicht das hat einzig und allein herr gagelmann gesehen
4321384 es war eine typische rudelbildung zehn andere spieler haben das gleiche gemacht wie grafite es dr ngt sich leider der eindruck auf dass er ganz bewusst herausgegriffen wurde
4321385 es ist schon merkw rdig mit welcher vehemenz die sache verfolgt wird ich habe fr her auch viele freundschaftsspiele bestritten da ging es ganz anders zur sache strafen waren aber immer auf den jeweiligen wettbewerb beschr nkt
4321386 f r den sportlichen erfolg ist geld allein nie ausreichend
4321387 the american psychological associations so called study is nothing more than a conclusion supported by opinions screened to match that predetermined outcome
4321388 the apa ignored or downplayed large peer reviewed studies showing a clear link between abortion and subsequent problems such as depression
4321389 professionalism and intellectual honesty are not concepts i would associate with this report
4321390 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4321391 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4321392 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4321393 since arriving in 2006 liz has led a resurgence at prevention that has been nothing short of remarkable
4321394 her pitch perfect understanding of what the prevention reader wants sets liz apart and her ability to build a dynamic brand is matched by her ability to build a dynamic staff we look forward to seeing her bring our many ambitious and exciting goals for the prevention brand to life
4321395 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4321396 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4321397 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4321398 i think these ballots need to be up in tallahassee now so whatever needs to be done can be done quickly
4321399 richard nixon was known as the man who would cut and slash the opposition and so that kind of dirty politics work would be done by nixon
4321400 lyndon johnson was the man and he delivered texas which helped john kennedy in a very close race
4321401 senator i knew jack kennedy jack kennedy was a friend of mine youre no jack kennedy
4321402 in the fast fuel episode ludacris and lees biodiesel tour buses are running on empty in the middle of the texas panhandle
4321403 they must roll into a fast food restaurant and look for fast food grease to turn into eco friendly fuel will this battle include discussion of the efficacy of biofuels as a long term petroleum substitute or the possible argument that biofuels are a crime against humanity
4321404 the reality is americans still take their cues from high profile people
4321405 have got golden opportunity to use their public profile to shine a light on these issues and get people to engage in their everyday lifestyle
4321406 the idea is if they can do it so can we
4321407 to see that celebrities and directors were driving the car that gave the car a cool vibe instead of a nerdy little weird car vibe
4321408 people take their fashion and style messages from celebrities why wont they also take their environmental messages
4321409 i dont know if theres time to go door to door and show people
4321410 thats why its good to have this celebrity platform anyone who uses their celebrity this podium responsibly im all for it
4321411 we face a lot of legislative and regulatory issues we resourced our advocacy to match our challenges
4321412 the association is pleased that hhs is taking its advice
4321413 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4321414 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4321415 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4321416 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4321417 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4321418 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4321419 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4321420 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4321421 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4321422 anyway facebook has had crushing success while myspace continues to grow
4321423 this is the man woman transgendered yak we are entrusting to make decisions as we would want them made
4321424 the least we can do if were allowing people to cut our yards wash our cars clean our houses for probably very cheap wages the least you can do is let their children have an opportunity thats the american way
4321425 they might deal with it internally suspending the person or having the person move on so their license is never investigated
4321426 its a dog okay you can get another one relax
4321427 you cant talk to people like that when their world is collapsing around them
4321428 so what should have been maybe a two or three minute problem on the side of the road became a 14 minute traffic stop
4321429 i can see the fact that i was speeding and that was wrong
4321430 i wouldnt have driven like that obviously if there would have been more traffic
4321431 i really dont care about your dog okay because at the rate you were driving you were putting every other driver on this road in danger

4321437 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4321438 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4321439 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4321440 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4321441 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4321442 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4321443 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4321444 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4321445 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4321446 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4321447 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4321448 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4321449 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4321450 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4321451 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4321452 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4321453 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4321454 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4321455 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4321456 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4321457 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4321458 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4321459 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4321460 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4321461 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4321462 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4321463 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4321464 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4321465 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4321466 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
4321467 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
4321468 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
4321469 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
4321470 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
4321471 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
4321472 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
4321473 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
4321474 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
4321475 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
4321476 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
4321477 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4321478 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how
4321479 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
4321480 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4321481 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4321482 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole
4321483 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4321484 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4321485 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4321486 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4321487 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4321488 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4321489 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4321490 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead

4321493 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4321494 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4321495 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4321496 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4321497 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4321498 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4321499 the veepstakes buzz today appears to be that barack obama is seriously considering selecting evan bayh as his running mate and while there have been a number of other boomlets for vp candidates in recent weeks the timing of this one coupled with the fact that bayh unlike a number of other names in the news hasnt been assigned a speaking spot at the upcoming convention indicates that the buzz might have the ring of truth
4321500 regardless of bayhs merits as a running mate and potential vice president his selection would carry with it one immutable and giant negative the inauguration of vice president bayh would very likely create a new republican senator indiana gov mitch daniels is a bush loyalist who has a substantial 10 15 point lead over democrat jill long thompson in his bid for re election as much as wed like to hope for the best its improbable that long thompson is going to defeat daniels now indiana democrats will point out that long thompson has done well in fundraising and that the presence of bayh on the ticket would undoubtedly help her but the fact remains that daniels is more likely than not going to win the race and that means that he would have the ability to appoint bayhs successor in the senate
4321501 democrats can expect to come out of november with 55 58 senate seats not including joe lieberman wholl probably go along with the democrats on a number of cloture votes that puts us in a very good position to beat filibusters on a number of crucial legislative initiatives but every seat that goes to a far right republican is a body blow to our ability to really take advantage of our majority barack obama needs to ask himself whether evan bayh is worth possibly losing meaningful health reform or immigration reform
4321502 in contrast to his indefatigable passionate and legislatively masterful father evan bayhs approach to policy and politics comes off as flat and squeezes the air sizzle and enthusiasm out of the obama balloon
4321503 there is reluctance in my heart as i know there is in the other senators to contemplate the use of force
4321504 we were simply left with no other credible alternative to protect the safety and well being of the american people
4321505 he was not only wrong he was aggressively wrong in my view he would contradict if not undermine the obama message of change turning a new page on foreign policy and national security
4321506 we are not going to get into which particular person is good or bad we hope that emphasizing senator obamas judgment against the war is something they consider in making their pick
4321507 advocacy for the war could complicate his prospects for getting on the ticket despite bayh having served as a popular two term governor who could make indiana a competitive state and appeal to blue collar democrats who have been slow to embrace mr obama
4321508 appeared to dim the changes that the states current governor would be selected
4321509 typically complement the presidential candidate mr kaine 50 more replicates mr obama he is an inspiring speaker a harvard trained lawyer who spurned corporate work for civil rights
4321510 someone driving to work goes past a petrol station and sees petrol at a bargain price and thinks you beauty but when they drive home its gone up 10c a litre it makes people very angry
4321511 australians dont want that great volatility in prices but nor do they want to pay more for their petrol to do away with it
4321512 the government wants to see an end to the days when you drive past a petrol station in the morning and see a certain price and drive past in the afternoon and see a price 10c or 15c a litre higher
4321513 i just dont think its going to do what its meant to do
4321514 i am frightened by the crowd for we are getting much too loud and theyll crush us if we go too far
4321515 why should i die why should i die can you show me now that i would not be killed in vain show me theres a reason for your wanting me to die youre far too keen on where and how but not so hot on why
4321516 the council has not yet announced a presidential candidate the general assembly will elect eligible candidates who will be at the helm of the affairs of the council for another term

4321518 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4321519 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4321520 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4321521 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4321522 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4321523 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4321524 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4321525 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin

4321528 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
4321529 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
4321530 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
4321531 kids today have been given everything they want and dont have to work for it they have no respect for authority
4321532 theyll make remarks right to the face of the mall cops i get to the point where i want to do something
4321533 but the police say we cant that we just have to stand there
4321534 the older people just dont see obama in these glowing terms
4321535 for older voters a lot of the reservations really have to do with this experience factor while younger voters see in obama something much closer to themselves
4321536 kids want to think for themselves they dont care what mom and dad say
4321537 this was a republican stronghold but its changing very quickly because its mom and dad youre republican so i aint ever going to be one of them
4321538 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
4321539 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
4321540 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
4321541 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
4321542 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
4321543 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
4321544 who will be the next president of the united states
4321545 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
4321546 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
4321547 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
4321548 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
4321549 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4321550 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4321551 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4321552 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4321553 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4321554 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4321555 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4321556 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4321557 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4321558 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4321559 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4321560 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4321561 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4321562 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4321563 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4321564 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4321565 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4321566 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4321567 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4321568 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4321569 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4321570 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4321571 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4321572 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4321573 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4321574 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4321575 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4321576 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4321577 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4321578 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4321579 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4321580 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
4321581 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
4321582 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
4321583 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
4321584 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4321585 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4321586 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4321587 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4321588 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4321589 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4321590 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4321591 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4321592 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4321593 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4321594 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4321595 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4321596 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4321597 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4321598 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4321599 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4321600 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4321601 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4321602 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4321603 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4321604 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4321605 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4321606 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4321607 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4321608 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4321609 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4321610 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4321611 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4321612 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

4321618 hearing more residents voice their concern thats why im voting against this
4321619 i was in rosario argentina in a house evita had donated
4321620 i remember seeing a black dog with peron painted on
4321621 the system evita used is similar to the one venezuelan president hugo chavez is using now
4321622 for a while she didnt want to let people think she was that ill and she pretty much had to be held because she was so weak
4321623 it was like the people had lost their own parents she was like a mother to the masses
4321624 my only daughter i have no more daughter i was a single mother for all my life i work hard for her

4321628 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4321629 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4321630 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4321631 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4321632 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4321633 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4321634 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4321635 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4321636 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4321637 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4321638 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4321639 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4321640 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4321641 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4321642 who are open to doing something on the production side
4321643 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4321644 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4321645 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4321646 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4321647 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4321648 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4321649 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4321650 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4321651 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

4321658 those who choose ati radeon solutions can be confident their purchase will give them the visually rich high performance experience they expect
4321659 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4321660 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4321661 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4321662 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4321663 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4321664 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4321665 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4321666 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4321667 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4321668 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4321669 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4321670 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4321671 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4321672 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4321673 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4321674 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4321675 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

4321686 several factors indicate that radio station know should shift its programming from rock and roll music to a continuous news format consider for example the number of older people in our listening area has increased dramatically while the total number of our listeners has recently declined also music stores in our area report decreased sales of recorded music finally continuous news stations in neighboring cities have been very successful and a survey taken just before the recent election shows that local citizens are interested in becoming better informed about politics

4321689 uncle john loved to smile and he loved his family and his job

4321700 fda requests seizure of animal food products at petco distribution center
4321701 we simply will not allow a company to store foods under filthy and unsanitary conditions that occur as a direct result of the companys failure to adequately control and prevent pests in its facility
4321702 consumers expect that such safeguards will be in place not only for human food but for pet food as well
4321703 tonight i grew so hungry that i ate dog food and cough drops for dinner
4321704 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4321705 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4321706 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4321707 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4321708 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4321709 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
4321710 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4321711 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
4321712 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
4321713 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
4321714 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
4321715 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
4321716 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
4321717 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
4321718 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
4321719 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
4321720 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
4321721 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
4321722 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4321723 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4321724 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4321725 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4321726 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4321727 just so you all know we did set a record
4321728 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4321729 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4321730 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4321731 we have to get the country off the 700 billion a year it spends on foreign oil
4321732 its a killer and is going to cause our economy great problems
4321733 what im doing now im trying to do for the country
4321734 he asked if we could we join together and do something i told him no because global warming is on page two for me
4321735 feeling is they have more in common than the elements that might separate their proposals
4321736 as soon as you open up the marketplace you are going to see an explosion in entrepreneurial activity
4321737 theres an emerging consensus that renewables which have been derided for so long as a pop gun when you need a cannon are showing signs of being able to contribute on a much larger scale than anyone has thought
4321738 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
4321739 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
4321740 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
4321741 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
4321742 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4321743 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4321744 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4321745 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4321746 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4321747 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4321748 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4321749 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4321750 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4321751 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4321752 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4321753 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4321754 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4321755 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4321756 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4321757 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4321758 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4321759 you are so unfair you are always out to get me
4321760 i worked hard on this project your expectations of me are higher than anyone else in this class because i am the only one who is a major
4321761 i would like to sit down with you and go over the grading of my project i believe that if i have the chance to explain a bit more about what i did you might be able to re evaluate my grade additionally i am unclear about some of the comment you made i hope that through discussing it i might get a better idea about exactly what it is that you expected to be done for this assignment
4321762 i can do a lay up and it would never miss
4321763 reports say that she he may have been only 13 last november
4321764 every minute of instruction a child misses will never be made up
4321765 there is just no way to make up for lost instruction time
4321766 it is home and whenever people ask where im from i specifically say topeka kansas i dont say the midwest im very proud to have been from here
4321767 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4321768 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4321769 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4321770 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4321771 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4321772 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4321773 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4321774 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4321775 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
4321776 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
4321777 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
4321778 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
4321779 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
4321780 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
4321781 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
4321782 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
4321783 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
4321784 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
4321785 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
4321786 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
4321787 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4321788 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4321789 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4321790 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4321791 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4321792 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4321793 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4321794 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4321795 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
4321796 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4321797 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4321798 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4321799 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4321800 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
4321801 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
4321802 top gun and wanting to be an astronaut because of
4321803 christian bale attended a london police station on a voluntary basis in order to assist with an allegation that has been made against him to the police by his mother and sister
4321804 mr bale who denies the allegation co operated throughout gave his account in full of the events in question and has left the station without any charge being made against him by the police
4321805 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4321806 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4321807 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4321808 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
4321809 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
4321810 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4321811 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
4321812 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
4321813 many of us are concerned about the quality of care extended to those who receive elective surgery
4321814 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4321815 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that senator mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4321816 ive always had a problem with people telling me oh you
4321817 so when everyone was telling me that i had to release my single on itunes because they own the market and thats just what youve gotta do these days i decided that i wasnt going to do it my whole career ive done that whenever everyones headed in the same direction i turn around and run the other way
4321818 this whole thing wasnt some attempt to change the way the industry works or some sh like that it was basically me knowing i had a good song one that people would love when they heard it
4321819 i mean people say itunes is popular because its convenient but so is mcdonalds that dont mean people arent still making reservations to go eat at fancy restaurants too
4321820 i knew the track was solid its got two of the best songs of all time mashed up together lynyrd skynyrds sweet home alabama and warren zevons werewolves of london its got great melodies so really my work was done
4321821 i knew people would hear it and know i wrote it theyd know it was real and thered be that connection and thats whats missing in music today i think people dont believe half the sh they hear some rapper or some pop girl singing about but with me they do and thats why people have reacted the way they have to the song
4321822 i think today everyones worried about looking cool about over thinking everything about all this bullsh
4321823 i just think thats a waste of time and i think a lot of other people do too i just want to have fun enjoy life and have a good time and i think theres a lot of people out there who are just like me
4321824 theres a time and place for everything and now is the time
4321825 i felt like there was no bigger event in hip hop at this moment than me and t i working together
4321826 it was always turmoil between our camp and his camp us as the bosses of our companies everyone is gonna follow our lead wed figure if it aint no problem and we dont have no issues no beef then theres no reason we shouldnt be able to get together and make music that was an executive decision that was made on both our behalves
4321827 i was surprised just as much as everybody else was
4321828 i talked to luda and he said it was time to sit down do business make grown man moves both of them got albums coming out time to try new things cris did something for t i too that nobody heard yet its about to come out soon its a good move
4321829 its showing that once great minds set their differences aside they can make something happen
4321830 thats two grown men not two grown males grown men
4321831 and i aint no preacher but heres my erick sermon
4321832 so eat this black music and tell me how it tastes now and f jesse jackson cause it aint about race now
4321833 walk through the gates of hell see my impala parked in front with the high beams on me and the devil sharin chronic blunts listening to pictures of don imus for target practice
4321834 i know obama would but would hillary take part i feel the pain of nelson mandela cause when it rains it pours i need rihannas umbrella for coretta scott kings teardrops when she got the phone call that the future just took a f ing headshot
4321835 i wonder why jesse jackson aint catch him before his body dropped
4321836 just me taking flight man this album is gonna be real special from beginning to end its gonna knock
4321837 i continue to recall with gratification the laudable manner in which the 1994 revolution ushered in its wake unprecedented national development and advances in the socio economic arena i also note with great delight the manner in which the peaceful take over has over the years positively transformed the perception and world view of the gambian citizenry instilling in them the core values of patriotism and self worth

4321840 i pray that allah whom we serve will protect and guide you with renewed strength and wisdom to implement your programmes and projects through vision 2020 onwards to vision 2121 with best wishes for your long life good health and wealth and your family

4321858 encrucijada de civilizaciones es un espejo en el que podemos vernos a nosotros mismos ya que la configuraci n actual de nuestra sociedad es en gran medida producto de las culturas representadas en esta exposici n hasta cierto punto el sincretismo representado es similar al que nos define en la actualidad
4321859 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4321860 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4321861 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4321862 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4321863 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4321864 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4321865 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4321866 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4321867 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4321868 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4321869 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4321870 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4321871 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4321872 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4321873 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4321874 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4321875 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4321876 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4321877 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4321878 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4321879 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4321880 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4321881 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4321882 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology

4322117 we continue to see strong results in 2008 with the second quarter yielding record production results in what is typically our slowest quarter of the year
4322118 the first half of 2008 laid the groundwork for what we believe will continue to be a strong year for the company
4322119 additionally our focus on maximizing shareholder value remains a top priority for our company as part of this effort we were pleased to move forward with some major corporate governance initiatives including the election of an independent board of directors that would enable cneh to further qualify for a listing on a major u s exchange by the end of the fiscal year we have a great opportunity to further expand the presence of our operations and increase our productivity in the second half the initiatives we have in place today will provide benefits to our shareholders in the months and years ahead
4322120 the significant revenue growth during the quarter resulted from increased sales of our interactive content and data applications as well as from increased subscriptions to our quotestream product line

4322156 it increased the rate of formation of tumours and it increased the number of tumours in the mice
4322157 we really dont know what is associated with tumour formation it might be all of the constituents
4322158 i guess the basic question is can we apply our data to humans and we dont know the answer to that
4322159 i think theres a need now for epidemiologists to take a look and see whether people that are using moisturising creams have an altered risk of skin cancers
4322160 one finds considerable inadequacies in i believe the way these studies have been undertaken
4322161 the more one looks through it the meaning that one might conclude from the data dissolves in those inadequacies
4322162 there are significant differences between the skin of mice and humans
4322163 for a study of this type to be reliable it should have been conducted over the 18 month life cycle of the mice this study went for just 17 weeks
4322164 because of the nature of the business theres a lot of travel involved odd hours thereve been times we all live under the same roof but we havent seen each other for days on end

4322170 the banking problems in the united states continue to mount while the federal governments deficit continues to soar out of control so what happened to cause the dollar to rally over the past three weeks in a word
4322171 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars
4322172 on july 16 2008 the federal reserve reported holding 2 349 billion of us government paper in custody for central banks in its report released today this amount had grown over the past three weeks to 2 401 billion a 38 4 annual rate of growth so central banks were accumulating dollars over the past three weeks at a rate far above what one would expect as a result of the us trade deficit the logical conclusion is that they were intervening in currency markets they were buying dollars for the purpose of propping it up to keep the dollar from falling off the edge of the cliff and doing so ignited a short covering rally which is not too difficult to do given the leverage employed in the markets these days by hedge funds and others

4322243 theres been a number of complaints received from the downtown business association the merchants along with several of the citizens of the town of wide open drug trafficking taking place right on commercial street drug abuse and offences of that nature
4322244 weve done operations with regard to the street crime unit and the community safety enforcement unit on a smaller level but it was obvious an operation like this was required to deal with the number of individuals involved
4322245 the operation was targeting street level dealing so what was purchased is a variety everything from pills of oxycontin hydromorphone to grams of cocaine grams of marijuana so the variety is street level value in each case
4322246 as a result of the information that weve been able to obtain from the operators and investigators themselves theres no doubt that theres connections to other organizations that are involved in organized crime throughout the atlantic region and possibly throughout the country

4322258 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4322259 we will be having focus groups in the four counties so well certainly be looking for participation from individuals groups and organizations to come forward
4322260 with this topic its very personal so we dont anticipate that it will be very easy for someone to come to the focus group and open up about what it is that is their problem in their daily life but they will learn about the project and theyll learn about the contact numbers and we expect that people would call on their own after these groups or on the urging of someone else
4322261 we call it violence against senior women but its so much more than that violence to an individual means different things and it could be the struggle of everyday life the struggle of having to put food on the table and buy their prescriptions or getting transportation to somewhere and they dont have the money for that
4322262 were very excited to jump in there head first and get people involved and get people talking about it and hopefully help a lot of people find a place to go and answers and that theyre not alone there are other people facing the same kind of difficulties they are

4322271 teixeiras the kind of guy who will work the count
4322272 it seems like its just been an attack on our receiving corps
4322273 theyre the ones dictating how defenses play us because if you dont get down there and load the box youre going to have a hard time slowing our guys down
4322274 i may want to and i may get bigger numbers but ideally were probably hurting ourselves if im a starter you really want me to be in the slot and have the bigger receivers on the outside
4322275 i want them back on the field but i want them back and healthy i dont want them rushing back
4322276 i saw a lot when porter was healthy we definitely have a no 1 guy in him

4322331 promising full touchscreen functionality with a business rather than consumer focus the omnia sports a 3 2 inch screen comes with hsdpa 7 2mbps and wi fi connectivity a 5 megapixel camera accelerometer and will come with two memory options 8 or 16gb it might feature a large touchscreen but an iphone competitor this isnt nor is the i900 likely to stand up to any android handset prototype weve seen to date down to the unimaginative user interface

4322333 video killed the spirit and showmanship that movies was all about and turned the mob mentality of a theatrical screened movie into a solitary consumer experience that plays into the arrested development
4322334 its hard to remember now but before social security nearly half of americas seniors lived in poverty after a lifetime of playing by the rules and working hard there was no guarantee of a secure retirement
4322335 my grandfather franklin delano roosevelt and a majority of americans thought that was wrong
4322336 they believed that lifting our seniors out of poverty is a reflection of our nations core values
4322337 thats why my grandfather signed the social security act seventy three years ago today one of the great successes of the 20th century today social security lifts nearly 13 million seniors and 1 3 million children out of poverty
4322338 back in 1935 a small minority did not share those values
4322339 our social security isnt a disgrace its a compact a trust between generations of americans its a reflection of our values
4322340 on the 70th anniversary of social security americans stood together and said no to george bushs attempt to privatize social security
4322341 we are excited to begin the next phase of qualifying
4322342 there are no easy games and we know that guatemala is a very difficult team to play against at home its important that we start off the semifinal round in a positive way and we are confident the work from the last 18 months has prepared us for the task
4322343 see in this world xirena the simi does what she wants and akri he say okay simi whatever you want simi unless it involves eating people then he usually says no but thats the only time other than that he do what the simi says see how that works
4322344 you control fate all fate you can make everything all right please do it for your simi
4322345 i think its still too early to get up dont you think
4322346 i think so no offence but i though you werent going to be here
4322347 you know i dont always disappear when im with you
4322348 im okay just a little wave of pain hit me im fine though
4322349 how can anyone ever think that a caring generous boy like you can ever be seen as a demon he said as he bought the smaller body closer the raven haired mans face was inches away from the blondes
4322350 these people are blind do they not see that theres a hero before them its not like you had choice in this you were a mere baby and you had no saying weather you wanted the kyuubi inside you everyday of your life you deserve to be called a hero you put up with all this the villagers hurt you and yet you do nothing why is that so
4322351 how can you not want revenge how can you stand all this hatred im sure if this was someone else he or she wouldve taken revenge on the village
4322352 its not their fault those stupid villagers dont know what their doing their like a pack of sheep without their shepherd they listen to next voice that tells them what to do if he says to hate this person theyll hate him as well if he tells them to eat or sleep theyll obey his orders without questioning it
4322353 but you changed that you healed my heart once again
4322354 that pink haired girl is reeeeally getting on my nerves i should do something to fix this problem
4322355 if youre planning to kill her please dont its not her fault shes like that
4322356 i was hoping i could get the chance to talk to you later want to meet me in the training field ill go over there as soon as i take care of sakura
4322357 if that friend of yours wouldnt have come i wouldve done a lot of things to you
4322358 maybe we can do it some other time but for now
4322359 whatever anyway the reason why im here is that kakashi sensei told me that training is canceled today cause of some mission he needs to attend so pretty much we have a day off
4322360 so we dont have any training today huh perfect timing well then thanks for notifying me sakura chan
4322361 believe me sakura i tried i tried very hard to bring him back but in the end i wasnt able to do so and for that im sorry
4322362 sorry is that all you can say to me naruto sorry for not bringing sasuke back you think that one word would make me smile naruto why do you have to be so weak you were weaker than sasuke so it wouldnt be much of a surprise
4322363 sasuke was always better than you you shouldve been taken not him things would be better if you were never on our team
4322364 i dont know maybe some ramen dumplings or something i dont care im just hungry
4322365 i fucking love you konan i love you so much
4322366 itachi i want to start a new one i want to start out fresh once again and and the only way i can do that is if i clear things up
4322367 you dont need to say anything naruto just as long as you want to be with me too is fine
4322368 no i i want to clear things up otherwise ill regret it if i dont tell you
4322369 kissed but i ignored it at first since it was just accidental and such but after the mission to the land of waves when he nearly got killed i started having feelings for him few weeks later i confessed my feelings for him and he said he felt the same
4322370 we were happy for a few months but that was until he betrayed be for the first time
4322371 sasuke betrayed the 2nd time when he left the first time was when i found him with a girl he was kissing her and touching her all over i was so full of anger that at the moment i wanted to beat the living hell out of him but i didnt
4322372 i suppose im able to call myself stupid because afterwards i didnt mention anything about it we continued our relationship
4322373 months later he acted differently then his attitude completely changed right after our first encounter when you showed up at the hotel in front of my door he changed he was a completely different person then the sasuke i once loved was no longer there nothing of pureness was left all there was was an empty shell filled with darkness and lust for power no longer was there love in that relationship i though it would have to take a miracle to fix this whole mess but nothing came it was endless nights of loneliness that made me feel worthless few months back sasuke told me to move in with him and i did for a short while anyway i slept alone in his room he never showed up i often wondered where he went but i imagine he was probably training or fucking some girl behind my back i knew then he would sleep with a girl just so he can rebuild his clan i tried hard to make sasuke happy again but nothing worked i lost faith in my love for him only then did i realized i truly lost him
4322374 then months later before i knew it im fighting him in the valley of the end i suppose i injured him or something but i did promise that i would never forgive him for what he did no matter what i would never look at him the same way nor would i consider him as a comrade and thats pretty much what i needed to clear up
4322375 now that you heard my story do you still do you still want to be with me
4322376 why would you ever think i rejected you by not saying anything
4322377 i needed a moment for everything to sink in i believe that you can start out fresh once again i want to be there when you do so unless you dont want me to and ill respect that
4322378 no stay with me itachi i need you to be here with me
4322379 alright i stay here with you but just know that even if you didnt want me here with you i still wouldve stayed
4322380 though i have to admit im a little scared that you still might have feelings for my little brother
4322381 of course not dont think that itachi believe me those days are over so theres nothing to worry about
4322382 oh how i love you konan you make me feel free when you kiss me
4322383 when im with you i feel so much happier and safe
4322384 i cant understand how people like you can walk the earth you all should die and burn in hell
4322385 its people like you who should keep their traps shut and mind their own business let us gay lesbians bisexuals or whatever get on with our lives and leave us the hell alone
4322386 sounds to me like your complaining rather than telling the truth its not our fault and dont come to us with the crap about how love isnt possible for the same gender couple cause thats bullshit dont take out your anger on other people just because that damn uchiha didnt return your feelings i can see why he loved naruto rather than a bitchy pink haired woman
4322387 if you ever and i mean ever hit my lover like that again i will make sure you never breathe fresh air again
4322388 if you dont want to suffer a massive headache tomorrow i suggest you to get out of here
4322389 i will go but i wonder what the hokage will say when she finds out a couple of akatsuki members roaming around the village
4322390 your timing is perfect how did you know we were here
4322391 so youre the one named kyo itachis been talking about you saying how he trusts you with his secrets
4322392 and itachis been telling me how much he thinks your cute naru chan
4322393 well tell the leader you stayed behind to gather more info
4322394 thank you but make sure kyo doesnt say anything about me wanting to stay for naruto
4322395 all right then well see you at the base then
4322396 i suppose we can drop her off at the hospital we can say we found her here unconscious
4322397 just leave her here itll be less trouble for us
4322398 even though shes annoying shes still my teammate and stuff
4322399 i was wondering i ca somehow try to convince baa chan to let you stay so we can be together coming only for a few days dont exactly cut it ya know
4322400 i want to stay here with you too but youre forgetting im an s class missing nin i killed my clan and i doubt the villagers would want someone like me too return to the village
4322401 i know youre innocent i believe you didnt kill your family without a good reason
4322402 the council will never want someone who betrayed konoha back it would be an insult to them
4322403 dont worry about it koi as long as i can see you even for a fleeting moment means so much to me its better than anything right
4322404 yeah i suppose but i promise ill find a way
4322405 ugh forget about that low ranking trash you need to focus on your goal sasuke
4322406 if i breathe or turn the wrong way it bothers me
4322407 i cant believe he did it this is amazing im so happy i can only jump up and down
4322408 the first thing i thought of was my parents and my coach
4322409 we are proud descendants of the great ghengis khan and tuvshee proved the strength of mongolians in the olympics
4322410 it is so exciting that our mongolian flag was raised in beijing and tuvshee won in the judo competition
4322411 me and several of my friends have bought mongolian vodka to celebrate this wonderful news it is going to be a very exciting night
4322412 i felt fine making the play and then as i was walking back to the mound and i felt sharp pain
4322413 my opinion is that i will be back out there in two days but that usually doesnt come true
4322414 we were moving out today and we were just walking along the street and we found all the stuff that we need
4322415 its a tradition man hippie christmas dates back to the 60s
4322416 were going have a little sale up on our corner here at the co op
4322417 as a nonprofit organization we have to be very resourceful as to how we get our funds and serve the groups we work with and seeing all this good stuff go to waste really tears at your heart a little bit
4322418 bedbugs love to hide in those areas and its a really difficult infestation to get rid of
4322419 you can also get roaches and sometimes even mice from picking stuff up off the curb
4322420 you can zip them off and wash them and its like a brand new couch
4322421 at the core of liberalism is the spoiled child miserable as all spoiled children are unsatisfied demanding ill disciplined despotic and useless liberalism is a philosophy of sniveling brats

4322440 if you prefer to download updates via software update in the apple menu which would ensure that the correct version for your mac was being downloaded it is not recommended to allow su to install major or even minor updates automatically
4322441 there is always the possibility that the combined download and install which can be a lengthy process might be interrupted by a power outage or your cat walking across the keyboard and an interrupted install will almost certainly cause havoc
4322442 using the combo updater ensures that all system files changed since the original 10 4 0 are included and any that may have been missed out or subsequently damaged will be repaired
4322443 the penny has dropped no if you are on 10 4 11 that is as far as anyone knows the final version of tiger
4322444 the other items software updater tell you about should be installed so either get them from apples download pages or let software updater download them but not install them until you are ready and want to
4322445 as for did my mbp come with 10 4 11 i am not sure how to tell but as su doesnt offer the update you obviously already have it so why worry about from when you had it
4322446 in that case i think you should install it just to see that its simple and you have nothing to fear whatsoever
4322447 oh hi guys can any of you strapping young gentlemen tell me if this is the house of maromeye96xoxo
4322448 the installer encountered errors before boot camp could be configured
4322449 error applying transforms verify that the specified transform paths are valid

4322456 that man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages and lifted over ditches and to have the best place everywhere nobody helps me any best place and aint i a woman
4322457 i have plowed i have planted and i have gathered into barns and no man could head me
4322458 i could work as much and eat as much as man when i could get it and bear the lash as well

4322460 thats it honey whats intellect got to do with womens rights or black folks rights if my cup wont hold but a pint and yours holds a quart wouldnt you be mean not to let me have my little half measure full
4322461 that little man in black there he says women cant have as much rights as men cause christ wasnt a woman
4322462 from god and a woman man had nothing to do with him
4322463 if the first woman god ever made was strong enough to turn the world upside down all alone these women together ought to be able to turn it back and get it right side up again and now that they are asking to do it the men better let them

4322478 theres no surer way to turn new female fans into former female fans than by complaining about how hard it is to keep on weight
4322479 the world is a tragedy to those who feel and a comedy to those who think
4322480 i know and strangely enough that actually makes me feel better
4322481 theres no surer way to turn new female fans into former female fans than by complaining about how hard it is to keep on weight
4322482 theres some confusion and we havent decided that yet but the point of it is that weve been negotiating for months and its time to put up the product of those negotiations and if they fail republicans can come up with their stuff
4322483 whatever they want to bring to the floor so that we can vote no to taxes and move these negotiations forward so we can get done is fine with me
4322484 i hope that will engage us in the process and help democrats and the governor realize that were not going to support a tax increase
4322485 believes what the democrats put on the floor should have bipartisan support hell continue to push for that compromise until we get a budget
4322486 it is critical that we take action before monday because the democrats have taken budget reform very seriously
4322487 what do we care about going to the ballot for a phony rainy day fund its nothing republicans would vote on

4322516 recientes estudios nos permiten entrever un mundo en el cual el envejecimiento e incluso la muerte
4322517 casi todo el organismo humano se renueva varias veces a lo largo de la vida m s o menos cada siete a os somos personas nuevas en el sentido m s literal de la palabra
4322518 el cuerpo humano podr a regenerarse durante mucho tiempo incluso eternamente
4322519 tiene mucho m s potencial del que se puede utilizar durante la vida de una persona

4322521 reponemos las c lulas que revisten el interior del intestino una vez cada pocos d as las que revisten el interior de la vejiga de la orina una vez cada dos meses y los gl bulos rojos de la sangre una vez cada cuatro meses

4322523 en un a o aproximadamente el noventa y ocho por ciento de los tomos de nuestro cuerpo son reemplazados por otros que tomamos del aire el alimento y la bebida

4322528 hay genes que pueden decirles a las c lulas y a organismos enteros que envejezcan y mueran
4322529 seguramente reconocer que a casi todo el mundo le disgusta envejecer y morir de hecho muchos temen esa perspectiva en su libro

4322537 muchas de las decisiones que hemos tomado est n basadas en el largo plazo creo que los jugadores hardcore van a encontrar un juego que tiene mucha m s profundidad para ellos pero claramente hemos tomado la decisi n de que en las etapas tempranas el juego sea sencillo as que es f cil avanzar es divertido jugar y puedes hacerlo hasta con una sola habilidad pero a medida que te adentras en el juego empezaras a pensar cosas como bueno ahora necesitamos utilizar esta cosa para aturdir algunos monstruos luego tomar distancia para poder recuperarnos a eso nos hemos enfocado m s adelante en el juego
4322538 cuando el jugador tiene desventajas similares significa que podemos hacer muchos m s monstruos interesantes no tenemos que matarte para retarte podemos hacer un monstruo que afecte tu movilidad podemos crear un monstruo que tenda diferentes tipos de ataques que sean peligrosos para ti y que necesites evitar y as hacemos el combate mucho m s interesante
4322539 the komodo dragon which once survived on padar island has become totally extinct
4322540 their droppings can no longer be found there there is no clear reason for its extinction but rampant poaching of deer and wild boar its main prey and encroaching habitat due to forest conversion and wild fires are strongly believed to be among the causes
4322541 the number of komodo dragons is estimated at 2 500 scattered on komodo rinca and gili motang islands
4322542 the populations of wild boars and deer have gradually depleted on padar island and most of its forested areas have been damaged by fires
4322543 we are still determining the main cause of its extinction on padar island
4322544 according to our plan we will conduct a survey to ascertain the natural conditions on padar island and at the same time make an inventory of their prey in the area

4322549 pemex should be allowed to partner in every project as much as it deems convenient
4322550 the proposed reform does not allow a change to the constitution
4322551 the president has been very clear to say this reform is not the desirable reform it is merely the politically viable

4322564 now lord this is fine this is your assignment and i like it but if the coach puts the player on the bench and it means he doesnt need him in the game now youre under no obligation to tell me lord but if youd like to share with me id love to know why you didnt need me in the game

4322567 what is interesting is that the public sector in malaysia is moving towards foss independently from any government directive or a big day in court for the foss community
4322568 if a licensee does something under the particular license in question that it wasnt supposed to do then that doesnt mom nature wins again
4322569 as powerful as all this cool technology is its also fragile as i learned yet again today

4322573 i think as a motivating force for change pop culture is still at the forefront events like the amnesty tour brought a lot of attention pop culture is still the one way in which someone who is without power can attain it and bring about a change

4322579 we started slow and thats something that weve worked on
4322580 and it was hotly contested it was a 15 play period and the offense won 8 7
4322581 i had been throwing up all morning and didnt have much energy
4322582 we have been invited by the palestinian red crescent society of gaza to go to gaza the people of gaza expect us and will come out in their boats to meet us we will fish together
4322583 we are going through international waters we are not going through israel israel claims gaza is unoccupied and so we are going to unoccupied territory we will embark in cypress and disembark in gaza this can play out in many ways we may get blown out of the water we may get towed away but we will remain nonviolent and exercise the sovereignty of international waters for we are not going through israel we will not allow the coast guard to enter onto our boats we will demonstrate nonviolently our solidarity with the residents of gaza who invited us we are taking food water medicine but the issue is solidarity with the people of gaza if our rights are denied we will remain nonviolent
4322584 israel is not a democracy but is an ethnocracy meaning a country run and controlled by a national group with some democratic elements but set up with jews in control and structured to keep them in control missing from israels security framing is the very fact of occupation which israel both denies exists and that security requires israel control over the entire country rendering impossible a just peace based on human rights international law reconciliation
4322585 there is nothing new in gaza just more acute and the internal breakdown due to restrictions and 527 physical barriers and cantonizations make it impossible for palestinian businessmen to move their goods and they have been forced to hire israelis as middle men who are able to transport palestinian goods over the 535 miles of roads that palestinians have been denied access to
4322586 this has caused fragmentation isolation cantonization which will soon become worse
4322587 there is a great sense that the people are robbed of their space and time and this has resulted in a de development of the human being the issue is no longer occupation but sovereign control all vestiges of palestinian presence is being destroyed by israel
4322588 dont worry we know you are coming and we are waiting
4322589 it is time to speak openly and honestly about israel
4322590 forty years ago to this day june 8 1967 the change occurred the floodgates opened and money poured into israel as never before
4322591 lbj also threatened to court martial anyone who reported what had happened

4322594 if there is any authority over a child as a babysitter a youth minister a teacher
4322595 if a child is murdered in their care i would like the death penalty to be considered
4322596 to seek death on an individual you have to have circumstances that are egregious
4322597 and set apart this murder from all other murders that are committed
4322598 especially those that have kids because they never know whatll happen one day to the next
4322599 well i told my mom and she thinks we should get married
4322600 the president will neither be impeached nor prosecuted on any charges he will try and stay in pakistan
4322601 weve heard the reports and we continue to monitor it
4322602 we promise not to let our daughters marry the pagan people of the land nor to let our sons marry their daughters we further promise that if the people of the land should bring any merchandise or grain to be sold on the sabbath or on any other holy day we will refuse to buy it and we promise not to do any work every seventh year and to cancel the debts owed to us by other jews
4322603 remember that in a race everyone runs but only one person gets the prize you also must run in such a way that you will win all athletes practice strict self control they do it to win a prize that will fade away but we do it for an eternal prize so i run straight to the goal with purpose in every step i am not like a boxer who misses his punches i discipline my body like an athlete training it to do what it should otherwise i fear that after preaching to others i myself might be disqualified
4322604 as followers of moses they were all baptized in the cloud and the sea and all of them ate the same miraculous food and all of them drank the same miraculous water for they all drank from the miraculous rock that traveled with them and that rock was christ
4322605 if you think you are standing strong be careful for you too may fall into the same sin but remember that the temptations that come into your life are no different from what others experience and god is faithful he will keep the temptation from becoming so strong that you cant stand up against it when you are tempted he will show you a way out so that you will not give in to it
4322606 fear the lord you his saints for those who fear him lack nothing
4322607 if a man shuts his ears to the cry of the poor he too will cry out and not be answered
4322608 do we share with the poor just like jesus shared with us
4322609 in all that has happened to us you have been just you have acted faithfully while we did wrong
4322610 yet to all who received him to those who believed in his name he gave the right to become children of god
4322611 paul was willing to offend people over the gospel but wanted to offend them only over the gospel

4322618 i am there at the talks to protect the will of the people and we are taking a principled stand i maintain a principled stand to defend the will of the people
4322619 heyes agreed with the smoking ban and he has not given us the chance to have a say in the matter the ban is killing the trade
4322620 that is tragic news let me get one thing clear i have not set foot in the prince of orange for eight or nine years
4322621 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4322622 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4322623 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4322624 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4322625 i hate to get targeted on a number especially with four girls
4322626 the game of billiards has destroyed my naturally sweet disposition
4322627 the flowers the gorgeous mystic multi colored flowers are not the flowers of life but people yes people are the true flowers of life and it has been a most precious pleasure to have temporarily strolled in your garden
4322628 if it wasnt for erica i wouldnt know just how evil i am
4322629 meeting erica was a party by itself theres nothing like a meeting of the minds sometimes you feel more at home with someone youve never seen before than with people who have been in the background for years

4322647 beating erica sherman at pool was a rare treat and i think perhaps people should know even at the expense of possibly coming off as a braggart for going on and on about beating this aforementioned individual at her own game

4322670 the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well
4322671 a torturer who uses sex as a weapon to degrade and destroy his victims
4322672 were constantly sexually harassed by their comrades while they were serving in iraq or afghanistan
4322673 that has nothing to do with it its our offense we cant hit with runners in scoring position
4322674 i always figured it was dorothy dandridges way of saying thank you for telling her story
4322675 think halle is much better at underplaying like she does in this film
4322676 halle berry i think is a reason the movie wasnt so big i think the public is fatigued with berry
4322677 i suppose it depends on the kind of actress she wants to be or whether she wants to be known as an actress or as a star celebrity
4322678 will smith when he did hitch didnt want a black actress because he felt the movie wouldnt crossover
4322679 i liked halle in monsters ball i cant say whether i thought it was oscar worthy b c im trying to determine what an oscars really worth 3 6 mafia
4322680 one problem with liquor is that it is always the subject of a conscience vote in parliament
4322681 this does not help indeed it is hard to see why liquor should be the subject of a conscience vote the fact that it always has been in hardly a good reason
4322682 it there were not a conscience vote it would certainly assist in securing a coherent consistent and rational framework for dealing with a substance that imposes significant social costs on new zealand

4322688 i havent seen anything i dont know who took this decision it does not come under my responsibility but it must have been a security measure designed to protect the media there is nothing to fear there will be no negative impact on media access to the press centre
4322689 the journalists especially british and american ones and agence france presses correspondents are getting tired of the smooth as polished oak replies from the chinese representatives and the transparent readiness of ioc spokesperson giselle davis to always accommodate her chinese hosts
4322690 but this episode was exceptional and the daily press conference sometimes sounds like a dialogue from a samuel beckett play
4322691 despite the daily attempts by the ioc and chinese organisers to varnish reality the coverage of the olympic games is beginning to turn into a trial of strength between the foreign press and the partys legion of little soldiers including policemen and police spies

4322736 weve worked hard with the company to make sure things ran smoothly but we obviously had some glitches today
4322737 to complete the survey the hospitals have to gather quite a bit of information and the survey instrument is 60 some pages long
4322738 so its very comprehensive and theres been a lot of work done by leapfrog over the years to refine the measures and make them meaningful
4322739 the actual data submitted to leapfrog is kept confidential and then what leapfrog does is they apply their scoring algorithms to it and they provide the end results
4322740 so the score is there and they will show hospital a and it will show the score exactly as is theyre very transparent but you wont see the actual numbers that went into the calculation youll see an end composite score
4322741 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4322752 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4322753 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4322754 trabajar con ustedes no queremos estar excluidos de su proceso

4322758 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4322759 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4322760 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4322761 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4322762 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4322763 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos
4322764 celebrar n consultas y cooperar n de buena fe con los pueblos ind genas interesados por conducto de sus propias instituciones representativas a fin de obtener su consentimiento libre e informado antes de aprobar cualquier proyecto que afecte a sus tierras o territorios y otros recursos particularmente en relaci n con el desarrollo la utilizaci n o la explotaci n de recursos minerales h dricos o de otro tipo
4322765 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4322766 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4322767 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4322768 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4322769 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4322770 but now when i see you i feel like a fool i wish you wouldnt have seen me fall so hard
4322771 i started out by reading blogs and got interested in the whole thing i had spare time on a computer which i didnt have before
4322772 when i would click to make a comment it would tell me i needed a blogger account i looked into it and found out that it didnt cost a thing so i tried it out and it mushroomed from there and i got a lot of positive feedback its a good way to pass time
4322773 i come from a family that encouraged an interest in me from an early age by telling stories i cant even remember a time when it medieval history didnt fascinate me from there its a logical step to church architecture
4322774 church architecture has sort of become my main passion in life because toledo has so many incredibly beautiful churches
4322775 bloggers tend to be opinionated and not always very nice among bloggers in general there is far too much of a tendency to rant and complain however i find that people like to see beautiful churches and works of art why bother wasting time just yapping
4322776 i try to not let blogging take up more than two or three hours of my day the roving medievalist i post every day the other ones catholic toledo royal portraits etc i try to post at least once a week
4322777 i have regulars in ireland england france italy and malaysia people all over the world are interested in seeing beautiful works of art and its there for them
4322778 he is a fellow with a wry sense of humor
4322779 i wanted to offer the invitation out for coffee again saturday
4322780 playing pool with you and tyler was a lot of fun
4322781 i wasnt all over her we were having a friendly conversation because were
4322782 cant you just drop this little crush that you have on her shes not going to fall for an eighteen year old student who doesnt know what he wants to do with his life
4322783 on each of these sheets you have five essay questions
4322784 you can choose to either work on this solo or in pairs
4322785 your work sheets will need to be turned in by friday before the end of the school day
4322786 the building permit is to put one on the other side
4322787 there was a set of stairs on one side and we are going to put the ramp where the stairs used to be
4322788 they didnt have the time its in the works i am sure
4322789 nic dwa razy sie nie zdarza i nie zdarzy z tej przyczyny zrodzilismy sie bez wprawy i pomrzemy bez rutyny
4322790 the threshold is very high in order to get my agreement to approve the destruction of any building downtown
4322791 the united way building at one stranahan square is a unique and distinctive building that should be spared the wrecking ball
4322792 it is a signature building for downtown toledo and although relatively new it is an important part of the fabric of the downtown core
4322793 toledo has made great progress in renovating and reusing distinctive buildings that enhance community identity and pride and i am convinced that the demolition of the united way building will halt this progress and be a step backwards for the city and for the united way
4322794 i meet with bill kitson twice a month once on poverty commission matters and once on every citizen counts commission matters
4322795 there has been no change of heart or direction ill help the united way in any possible way but not in the demolition of the building
4322796 this mindset of destruction has seemed to overwhelm our community
4322797 it makes me sad to see were going to throw away this majestic building for a little tin box i see on the screen
4322798 we need to know that this building cannot be saved before we just commit it to the landfill
4322799 it doesnt matter to me who has funded the current building
4322800 it has become a part of the toledo landscape we should preserve that which is good
4322801 i think people get a little too emotionally attached to a building and they lose sight of the work that united way does
4322802 its not the building that drives the united way its the people
4322803 if they could save 400 000 a year by tearing down and rebuilding i think far be it for me to get in the way of that decision
4322804 im not exactly happy about the idea that were taking down that building
4322805 on the other hand the united way has the right within the parameters of planning and zoning to do what they need to do with their property
4322806 united way has to be run like a business too
4322807 i think we have enough issues on our plate dealing with city government that we dont need to express our opinions out to areas where were not even welcome let alone invited
4322808 i would like to see the building preserved and am delighted that the university of toledo is looking at it
4322809 i firmly believe that once they have the facts there really is no other reasonable decision that could be made
4322810 i think that people who truly care about the united way and all the united way does for this community will take the time to meet with the united way to understand the situation
4322811 you can read information in the newspaper or on the internet but it gets so overwhelming and confusing
4322812 and thats not just with elderly people thats young people looking for the right acne treatment or laser surgery or mens urology issues and medications and questions they would have for medical needs
4322813 theres a lot of new specialties that are popping up so the consumer has so many choices and how are they going to make those choices unless they really educate themselves on whats out there
4322814 our goal is just to fill that need to bring information to the community and bring an awareness to the regency campus let people know what we do here as well as providing the health and medical information that we feel are good topics of interest for the community
4322815 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth with oil deposits
4322816 now all the animals are asleep except of course for the ever alert hogs
4322817 because of the suspicious nature of the death and the unidentified substance it leads to a lot of questions
4322818 having the bible in one hand and a bread in the other hand is not a correct thing kill them kill them kill them that is my massage
4322819 we cant comment on where the investigation might be leading us

4322831 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
4322832 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people
4322833 you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there
4322834 but its definitely something we are considering from a hsbc group perspective
4322835 we always explore the potential application of new technologies and this is no different
4322836 no i dont i think the iphone would change some underlying infrastructure considerations from an enterprise perspective but apple has been pretty smart with the design
4322837 my son was in the boat crying hes wondering why we werent in there

4322843 this piece of code was left over from the pre release versions of update 2 and was designed to ensure that customers are running on the supported generally available version of update 2
4322844 i am sure youre wondering how this could happen we failed in two areas not disabling the code in the final release of update 2 and not catching it in our quality assurance process we are doing everything in our power to make sure this doesnt happen again
4322845 copyright holders who engage in open source licensing have the right to control the modification and distribution of copyrighted material
4322846 copyright licenses are designed to support the right to exclude money damages alone do not support or enforce that right
4322847 the choice to exact consideration in the form of compliance with the open source requirements of disclosure and explanation of changes rather than as a dollar denominated fee is entitled to no less legal recognition indeed because a calculation of damages is inherently speculative these types of license restrictions might well be rendered meaningless absent the ability to enforce through injunctive relief
4322848 the court has held that free licenses such as the creative commons or cc licenses set conditions rather than covenants on the use of copyrighted work
4322849 when you violate the condition the license disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer this is the theory of the gpl general public license and all cc licenses put precisely whether or not they are also contracts they are copyright licenses which expire if you fail to abide by the terms of the license
4322850 the gpl is another example of a license that depends on copyright law for enforcement because its a copyright license not a contract although this model train case is about a different license because the united states is a legal system based in part on case law every decision matters

4322887 aiding and abetting is a form of derivative liability and should be treated the same as the substantive or underlying offense

4322898 such hateful and discriminatory rhetoric is both insulting and callous and shows a level of insensitivity and ignorance which has seldom been encountered by this board of supervisors
4322899 cardinal levada is a decidedly unqualified representative of his former home city and of the people of san francisco and the values they hold dear
4322900 the congregation of the doctrine of the faith provoked this debate indeed may have invited entanglement
4322901 this court does not find that our case law requires political bodies to remain silent in the face of provocation
4322902 it is merely the exercise of free speech rights by duly elected office holders
4322903 sadly the ruling itself clearly exhibited hostility toward the catholic church
4322904 the judge in her written decision held that the church provoked the debate by publicly expressing its moral teaching and that by passing the resolution the city responded responsibly to all of the terrible things the church was saying
4322905 our constitution plainly forbids hostility toward any religion including the catholic faith
4322906 in total disregard for the constitution homosexual activists in positions of authority in san francisco have abused their authority as government officials and misused the instruments of the government to attack the catholic church their egregious abuse of power has now the backing of a lower federal court unfortunately all too often we see a double standard being applied in establishment clause cases
4322907 negatively influence the politics of americas most tolerant and progressive city
4322908 theyre loud theyre obnoxious theyre disgusting and they should get out of san francisco

4322910 it has become clear since the filing of this case that mr vick has very limited knowledge of the state of his finances it appears that mr vick has routinely relied upon others to make financial decisions for him giving them discretionary control over large sums of money

4322914 its wonderful to get an opportunity to spend six weeks on the road with the family i dont think weve spent this amount of time and this quality of time for over 10 years together
4322915 when we see the live audience hear their roar hear their appreciation that is the incentive
4322916 every time we keep feeling like oh my god last nights show was fabulous it has been very very overwhelming

4322919 japans consumption is bad exports to europe and the unitedstates arent good and it seems that the situation in china islikely to get tougher too

4322921 our customers are telling us their mainsummer holiday is sacrosanct we see no evidence that consumersare trading down or curtailing their holiday plans
4322922 most of next year isgoing to be very difficult we will batten down the hatches andtry to keep going on the current overhead but if things getworse we will have to cut more jobs

4322947 the thing called extended warranty is nothing but horse shit and what you get out of it is nothing but that you end up losing a few extra dollars so dont limit the usage of your stuff to avoid getting your warranty voided but instead use it beyond the manufacturers intended purpose of your device and modify it hack it to the level that youre only limited by cash and your sanity

4322968 now we find many people critical when a righteous person is killed a young father or mother is taken from a family or when violent deaths occur

4323032 es ist damit zu rechnen dass alle chemotherapiewirkungen die bei der mutter auftreten auch beim kind auftreten
4323033 wenn ein kind bei der krebsdiagnose der mutter 28 oder mehr wochen alt ist dann kann man schon berlegen es vorzeitig zu entbinden
4323034 die meisten frauen mit krebs entbinden zwischen der 32 und 34 woche

4323071 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4323072 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4323079 hes not even sure christian conservatives would vote for him let alone work for him if he picked a pro abortion running mate

4323081 that choice would go a long way to solidify his credentials

4323085 youre going to have to have a huge turnout of that base again for mccain to win
4323086 ninety percent of the workforce for bush in 04 came out of that constituency
4323087 picking a ridge or a joseph lieberman would not be helpful at all
4323088 the point that mccain was making is that people can differ on one issue and still be a vital member of our party
4323089 the fact that governor ridge is not perfectly in line with the party platform does not make him any less of a republican
4323090 the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4323091 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out for vice president
4323092 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that
4323093 this move to a pro choice running mate such as lieberman could help reshape his message to appeal to swing voters

4323100 every time we keep feeling like oh my god last nights show was fabulous it has been very very overwhelming
4323101 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
4323102 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat

4323118 theyre not going to jump in the pocket of the democratic party the way they did with the republican party
4323119 must be preceded by a passive affirmative nonchallenging attitude toward change among the mass of our people they must feel so frustrated so defeated so lost so futureless in the prevailing system that they are willing to let go of the past and change the future

4323131 anyone who is working against the haves is always facing odds and in many cases heavy odds if he or she does not have that complete self confidence or call it ego that he can win then the battle is lost before it is even begun
4323132 ego must be so all pervading that the personality of the organizer is contagious that it converts the people from despair to defiance creating a mass ego
4323133 it is the schizophrenia of a free society that we outwardly espouse faith in the people but inwardly have strong doubts whether the people can be trusted
4323134 turn to an extreme chauvinism and become defenders of the american faith
4323135 activists and radicals on and off our college campuses people who are committed to change must make a complete turnabout
4323136 our rebels have contemptuously rejected the values and way of life of the middle class they have stigmatized it as materialistic decadent bourgeois degenerate imperialistic war mongering brutalized and corrupt

4323141 i still think that we have a club that can be in the playoffs
4323142 obviously we have to win a lot of games and we have to play flawless baseball
4323143 it seems like weve had a lot of that those kind of lapses
4323144 when you look back it hasnt cost us games but you see it happen and you say to yourself thats not good baseball thats not crisp baseball id never ever bring my mind to think this team cant make the playoffs
4323145 we have to play better we have to play better in all areas offense and defense weve got to clean some things up
4323146 the last two weeks have been rough theyve been bad however you want to phrase it we dug ourselves a hole and now we have to try and come out of it

4323152 we know good preventive care can go a long way towards saving money thats why some employers do first dollar coverage for annual visits and preventive screenings they dont want anything getting in the way of their employee getting that preventive care up front and in spite of that we have people who dont take advantage of it
4323153 if you avoid and dont get the tests you need and you let something get advanced then you pay more and you suffer more
4323154 as these costs go up people are going to be demanding action its time we can get to universal coverage with a combination of subsidies for low wage workers for high cost utilizers and helping to spread the cost over the broader population
4323155 without insurance its very difficult to get the health care services you need you dont have a medical home without insurance and a medical home is how you get preventive care
4323156 the use of preventive care is miserable for the most part and frequently miserable among workforces with the richest coverage

4323167 copyright holders who engage in open source licensing have the right to control the modification and distribution of copyrighted material
4323168 copyright licenses are designed to support the right to exclude money damages alone do not support or enforce that right
4323169 the choice to exact consideration in the form of compliance with the open source requirements of disclosure and explanation of changes rather than as a dollar denominated fee is entitled to no less legal recognition indeed because a calculation of damages is inherently speculative these types of license restrictions might well be rendered meaningless absent the ability to enforce through injunctive relief
4323170 the court has held that free licenses such as the creative commons or cc licenses set conditions rather than covenants on the use of copyrighted work
4323171 when you violate the condition the license disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer this is the theory of the gpl general public license and all cc licenses put precisely whether or not they are also contracts they are copyright licenses which expire if you fail to abide by the terms of the license
4323172 the gpl is another example of a license that depends on copyright law for enforcement because its a copyright license not a contract although this model train case is about a different license because the united states is a legal system based in part on case law every decision matters
4323173 the report reveals just how important the internet has become as the unifier of the direct and brand marketing disciplines and that brands need to include search engine optimisation much earlier in the planning process than many do currently

4323180 so it becomes a bit of a train crash as charterers stumble over each other to get the ships that are there and in doing so push the market a little bit higher
4323181 what we can all say is when the capesize index decides to move it moves quickly but the question that will now loom is whether that premium above the spot market is appropriate and sustainable
4323182 i think we will test whether or not the market is justified at these levels and i think it will be found wanting in doing so we will visit lower territory

4323195 the next step is to be able to do it consistently this game is the next opportunity to show what i have
4323196 obviously were talking about what gives us the best opportunity to win
4323197 i am still encouraged by all three quarterbacks and feel a lot better than i ever have about the position since ive been here at any time
4323198 obviously this has been a really hard week let alone the quarterback stuff going on
4323199 with this going on it kind of puts things in perspective for me it will be good to go down there and see all the people all the friends to kind of deal with it

4323208 we have sent out about 100 deputies and posse members
4323209 determinando que no se realice ning n evento electoral de car cter nacional hasta que las cortes departamentales cumplan con ese cometido
4323210 en defensa de los intereses nacionales y el desarrollo nuestros departamentos
4323211 mientras exista la confiscaci n de los recursos de nuestros departamentos advertimos a las autoridades nacionales que su presencia en nuestros departamentos no son consideradas gratas y bienvenidas
4323212 el directorio va a aprobar una propuesta que hemos estado trabajando durante este tiempo y la vamos a presentar al pa s nosotros creemos que va a ser un insumo importante para resolver el problema de le redistribuci n de los recursos nacionales que incluye el idh
4323213 podemos hacer una propuesta equilibrada que respete los recursos de las regiones que sea solidaria con otros departamentos donde est concentrada la mayor pobreza y necesidades

4323218 los sectores sociales apostaron no s lo por el liderazgo de evo morales sino por lo que en la actual coyuntura significa es decir una promesa de justicia social
4323219 en un s mbolo de esperanza por mejores d as para bolivia
4323220 el presidente evo morales tiene un respaldo masivo a nivel nacional y esto significa que tiene en este momento las posibilidades m s fuertes para llevar y recuperar su proyecto pol tico y gubernamental del a o 2006
4323221 este mayor porcentaje conseguido despu s de las elecciones presidenciales 2005 le da la posibilidad al presidente morales de reafirmarse como l der actual pero tambi n le exige que sea consciente racional que pueda llevar a los bolivianos al encuentro y concertaci n
4323222 el nico liderazgo que veo en este momento dentro del sector pol tico es el liderazgo del se or morales pero eso no significa que su gobierno lo est haciendo bien
4323223 el gobierno de la revoluci n ciudadana en nombre y representaci n de los ciudadanos y ciudadanas del ecuador saluda con respeto y emoci n c vica el triunfo pac fico del referendo revocatorio que es en suma el triunfo de la democracia en el hermano pueblo de bolivia

4323225 i was pleased with some of the things that we did especially on that drive where we went 90 yards
4323226 overall we did better today but we still have a lot of things that we need to improve on
4323227 he carried the torch for bud when he left san jose state
4323228 our sprinters look just like bud would want them to look
4323229 the country is more or less saturated with the gospel
4323230 you need to get help i received all those things at san jose
4323231 we wanted to accommodate the athletes but also seek to ensure they were able to manage the academic program
4323232 we told them we could not alter the academic standard
4323233 the whole idea was to go the states to get better training we dont need to go to the states anymore we can do it right here were doing that as we speak
4323234 i can tell you this in this olympics our sprinters are going to do very well
4323235 we got him in to the hut and got him comfortable but i think it happened pretty fast
4323236 they did an incredible job to try and revive him they worked on him for over two hours but in vain
4323237 an illegal loophole in the law to try to advance same day registration
4323238 we see the efforts of the republican party over the course of the last couple of days to deflect confuse and suppress voters
4323239 for me it was something my father always say he is always a believer and a hard worker to get to the next level
4323240 no matter what youve done before if youre working hard youre on the right track
4323241 en el di rio de daniela son escritas tantas cosas
4323242 we will have about five positions that are filled which we will eliminate over the next two weeks
4323243 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4323244 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4323245 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4323246 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4323247 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4323248 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4323249 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4323250 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4323251 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4323252 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4323253 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4323254 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4323255 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4323256 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4323257 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4323258 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4323259 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4323260 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4323261 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4323262 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4323263 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4323264 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4323265 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4323266 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4323267 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4323268 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4323269 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4323270 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4323271 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4323272 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4323273 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4323274 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4323275 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4323276 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4323277 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4323278 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4323279 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4323280 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4323281 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4323282 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4323283 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4323284 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4323285 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4323286 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4323287 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4323288 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4323289 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4323290 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4323291 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4323292 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4323293 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4323294 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4323295 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4323296 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4323297 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4323298 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4323299 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4323300 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4323301 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4323302 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4323303 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4323304 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4323305 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4323306 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4323307 they just love to get out here and do a little work

4323311 californians are paying over 4 50 per gallon for gasoline and deserve a representative who will work to end our nations dependence on oil and fight for alternative energy sources
4323312 andal has consistently voted against fuel efficiency programs and measures to slow global warming his current proposals echo the failed policies of the bush administration that created the situation were in now
4323313 that one of the liberal environmental groups has made a formal endorsement of my opponent doesnt surprise me a bit
4323314 i dont think a group like this is reflective of the district
4323315 this year californians have a clear choice between a proven leader who has spent his life working to find alternative energy sources and a developer who has habitually opposed clean energy
4323316 sister act may have last laugh in soon to be published memoir california young democrats share their feelings on golden state ballot measures pay attention now or dont ask later why youre paying 85 for a salad

4323318 this package obviously unabridged demands instant listening stories of 55 words length what a literary challenge to present both plot and characters with ultimate conciseness the three excellent readers attest admirably that it can be done and with style 55 words do indeed a story make just as this review is composed of 55 words

4323326 yes mike it happens every day after work amazing isnt it
4323327 but i beat you six times in a row yesterday and they were all scholars mates
4323328 no you didnt and your use of the term scholar there is pejorative
4323329 youre just blustering and pretending to be an intellectual elite
4323330 look mike i just got back from work im tired i dont want to play a game of chess right now
4323331 no its because i dont feel like trouncing you again
4323332 you know youve got a real attitude you didnt come anywhere near beating me i beat you each time
4323333 your claims of checkmate were unverifiable i could still move
4323334 moving the king six spaces is not a legal move mike
4323335 oh the mysterious magic rules of chess how convenient for you that they just happen to benefit you huh
4323336 i cant see them they dont exist you believe in this mythical thing you call rules that youve never seen with your own eyes
4323337 you know what larry you have a serious problem here you have to win at all costs
4323338 correct me if im wrong but isnt the object of a game of chess to you know win
4323339 i dont win at all costs i win by playing a good offense and a good defense yours doesnt measure up
4323340 never mind mike it was obviously an accidental pun i should have guessed it as poorly as you play chess
4323341 now listen here larry just because you declared yourself the winner by invoking some mystery magic rule that floats invisibly up in the air somewhere watching over us while we play a game of chess does not mean that you play chess better than me
4323342 of course not rather its my continual slaughtering of your defense and capturing your king that shows my chess skill trumps yours
4323343 dr graves has informed us youre a threat to yourself
4323344 the fact is larry when you say i and those who play chess like me are better at chess than you then thats the first sign that were dealing with some mental illness and we must react with appropriate humanity
4323345 dont worry im sure after just a few months of those shock treatments youll be able to play chess just as well as i can and then you can reintegrate into society
4323346 the magic of last years waterfront show was truly unforgettable for us well cross our fingers for the same golden weather but rain or shine its a hometown show and the crown jewel in our summer tour
4323347 i wanted the force of led zeppelin the groove of swampy delta blues and the guitars of the late 60s and early 70s i wanted to start writing music that lent itself to saturday night as opposed to sunday morning before when i would go into song writing mode it would be an acoustic in front of a fireplace or something like that this time it was more like a bottle of whiskey my tele and a fender amp with the reverb turned up
4323348 the philippine market is accelerating at a great pace it is probably in the top 20 markets in the world in terms of potential spending
4323349 we would like to spur the web as an advertising medium but what is lacking right now is local content on the web
4323350 content will increase in time as companies explore the web more as a medium
4323351 this is because they know they are playing in a global field
4323352 cios need to be hungry for change and even disruptive to make these changes happen they must be innovative think globally and should lead by example these are the qualities that cios should take so that they can be important contributors to businesses
4323353 the customer is always the priority and as demand for new services grows so does complexity its important that new players in globalization know where they are headed and what risks they are facing as they expand tracking all these changes is one thing that even global cios are having trouble with but its clear that they are making the necessary changes to adapt
4323354 this dismal situation is the direct consequence of totally insufficient consultation withy the people and the lack of transparency in the deliberation of the provisions of the moa ad
4323355 more than at anytime we appeal to all stakeholders particularly the grp milf peace panel to engage the entire nation in an open discussion of the contents of the moa ad
4323356 we believe that any peace agreement should respect sovereignty and territorial integrity as such we oppose any attempt to dismember our country by laying the foundation for the creation of an independent and sovereign bangsamoro state which will be given exclusive ownership of the areas delineated as their homeland
4323357 instead let us collectively strive for peace within the framework of the philippine constitution let us respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the filipino nation as well let us all support a genuine process for a sustainable and lasting peace

4323368 our job as church planters is to deploy the church into the whole earth not just grow a sunday gathering worship service
4323369 you dont get your wife pregnant by reading intended for pleasure with to her you get pregnant by engaging her the church must understand that learning about a culture is never enough we must engage the culture we hope to change
4323370 we dont go to the world to try and convert the world we go to the world because we have been converted
4323371 there are no movements in church planting in the west no matter what people say you cant control movements and the west wants to control everything so therefore the chances of us seeing a movement arent very good
4323372 the job of the 21st century pastor is to pray and fast fervently engage the society they hope to change and obey god in whatever he tells us to do
4323373 the gospel of jesus christ is to be both demonstrated by social actions works and communicated with our words both are equally important one cannot and should not be more important than the other

4323466 this was expected but whereas many pirates who debate the issue online are often abusive and aggressive on the topic most of the drm complaints were reasonable and well put

4323481 fasting during ramadan is a unique opportunity to attain both peace of mind and heart
4323482 during ramadan one concentrates on rendering good and abstaining from the wrong such a pursuit creates peaceful serenity in the hearts of men and women ramadan fasting cannot be complete and in fact the fast can be invalidated if one fails to control his or her temper the fasting persons are advised to refrain from argument and to inform the other party that they cannot continue the troublesome dialogue because they are engaged in the sublime obligation of fasting without doubt a full month of such restraint is destined to leave its mark upon our bodies and souls
4323483 ramadan fasting offers an opportunity for tazkiyah the cleansing of the self through its disciplinary regimen and on another level ramadan offers a unique opportunity for synthesizing with the less fortunate
4323484 two hungry wolves sent against a herd of sheep will not do more damage to it than a mans eagerness for wealth and prestige does to his religion
4323485 started to be revealed during ramadan and it is recommended that during this month we concentrate on the reading of the quran why this is because during this month we are less involved with physical needs and have a better opportunity of understanding the message the quran that is therefore there is a better chance of understanding the truth and reaching that spiritual elevation that we all desire

4323492 o people a great month has come over you a blessed month a month in which is a night better than a thousand months month in which allah has made it compulsory upon you to fast by day and voluntary to pray by night whoever draws nearer to allah by performing any of the optional good deeds in this month shall receive the same reward as performing an obligatory deed at any other time and whoever discharges an obligatory deed in this month shall receive the reward of performing seventy obligations at any other time it is the month of patience and the reward of patience is heaven it is the month of charity and a month in which a believers sustenance is increased whoever gives food to a fasting person to break his fast shall have his sins forgiven and he will be saved from the fire of hell and he shall have the same reward as the fasting person without his reward being diminished at all

4323497 the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4323498 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state

4323609 i was asked often about mass employment policies at the civil aviation union international conferences in vienna and toronto
4323610 i dont like to put my country down but when people ask me i have to tell the truth its disappointing and embarrassing that our national airlines employment policies arent on par with those of other national carriers
4323611 at mas most female flight attendants retire at 40 lead cabin crew can work till they are 45 men retire at 55 no matter what their grade
4323612 this is highly discriminatory there are national carriers in asia where women cabin crew retire much later
4323613 at 40 a woman may still have a mortgage and other expenses so she needs a regular income
4323614 together with womens non governmental organisations the union has written countless memoranda urging mas and the government to review the retirement age
4323615 unfortunately nothing has changed as a national airline mas should stop discriminating against its female cabin crew
4323616 the retirement age for airasia cabin crew who are all permanent staff is 55

4323680 two of us went out back and two stayed at the inside so it was a bit of a gamble i am glad i got two okay waves

4323693 sto attenta a quello che mangio bevo unenorme quantit di acqua e faccio ginnastica
4323694 le sostanze plastiche disperse nei nostri mari anche in piccoli frammenti
4323695 il problema si sia ormai spostato dalla semplice presenza di rifiuti plastici come bottiglie contenitori e altri detriti nelle nostre acque alla capacit di questi materiali di rilasciare sostanze pericolose per lorganismo umano
4323696 lenorme quantit di plastica dispersa negli oceani a livello globale produce particelle nocive che vengono liberate nelle acque ha detto contaminando i pesci e altri organismi marini che trattengono sostanze come il pcb la diossina ed altre molecole teratogene entrando in questo modo nella catena alimentare delluomo

4323698 durante la gestazione la donna trasmette al feto questi elementi che possono intaccare il sistema riproduttivo
4323699 abbiamo osservato ha raccontato la studiosa che nei bambini maschi nati da madri nelle quali si registrano alti livelli di questi elementi alcuni caratteri sessuali appaiono alterati
4323700 sebbene si tratti ancora di cambiamenti ormonali di lieve intensit quello che ci preoccupa la diffusione globale di queste sostanze plastiche e dunque l
4323701 la certezza che queste sostanze plastiche siano trasmesse di generazione in generazione
4323702 le sostanze plastiche sono presenti anche nei contenitori metallici che utilizziamo quotidianamente per la conservazione dei cibi o per la loro cottura a micro onde
4323703 sulla pericolosit delle sostanze plastiche dice il professor antonino zichichi presidente dei seminari di erice e della federazione mondiale degli scienziati la comunit scientifica ha espresso un parere unanime
4323704 theyre trying to whitewash their human rights record and present a pretty picture to the world when in fact behind the facade is an ugly reality and the situation in tibet is as bad as its been in a very long time
4323705 any attempts to hinder a journalist who is going about doing his job seemingly within the rules
4323706 it is precisely that word which was written in the discharge summary made by the medical specialists alongside with the referral to the toxicological unit in other words doctors were unable to reach any conclusion at all
4323707 in the case if you were in new zealand i am absolutely sure the officials would consider your application for asylum very quickly as you have a genuine and bona fide case and therefore you deserve and undoubtedly would be given real state protection and refuge there

4323710 this was a profit based decision where he did put profit over the welfare of the dogs

4323718 it kind of reminds me of vladimir putin invading georgia
4323719 the west has spent a lot of time energy and money to teach georgia the tricks of the trade to make the country look like a democracy
4323720 we and many other nations see through this deceit we understand that the seditious tactics of the so called colour revolutions are a real threat to international law and the source of global legal nihilism
4323721 in the old days under soviet rule we didnt believe a word of our own propaganda but we thought that information was free in the west and we longed for it
4323722 but we have learnt since that the west has its own propaganda and in some ways it is more powerful because people believe it
4323723 city turns into human hell many people still trapped under rubble
4323724 we have learnt from western tv how to simplify the narrative
4323725 saran diperhatikan dan tahun tahun sebelumnya pengalokasian anggaran untuk bantuan sosial ormas sudah dilaksanakan sebagaimana ketentuan yang berlaku
4323726 bantuan bidang pendidikan tersebut misalnya bantuan untuk insentif guru dan untuk pelaksanaan wajib belajar 9 tahun
4323727 diharapkan proyek bisa segera dituntaskan untuk kawasan yang agak alot masih menyusul

4323737 banyak orang membicarakan kami dan bilang kami memainkan sepakbola yang bagus sepakbola bagus itu baik tetapi kami tidak memenangi apapun anda bermain untuk menang

4323740 it kind of reminds me of vladimir putin invading georgia
4323741 this book and books like it destroy our political culture undermine fair elections inhabit the slippery space between politics and slander
4323742 these books destroy civic debate on purpose and are fundamentally at odds with democracy
4323743 that is not just factually wrong it is wildly immoral whether or not corsi published lies is not even half the discussion we should be having
4323744 it is hard to conceive of an america in which journalists use their broadcast power to protect our civic culture rather than promote shadowy figures who seek to destroy it but imagining it is the first step
4323745 fox is a republican mouthpiece not a legitimate news organization real news organizations must reject foxs smears of barack obama and get the real facts out

4323758 semua kesalahan itu harus segera dibenahi dan dilaporkan kembali kepada kami paling lambat 60 hari setelah hasil audit diberikan
4323759 kata marbun sesudah penyerahan hasil audit kepada masing masing kepala daerah kemarin
4323760 kami juga memeriksa pengendalian pencemaran udara sebanyak satu entitas dan memeriksa pembangunan gedung diagnosis centre rsu dr soetomo
4323761 jika sampai 60 hari tidak segera melapor akan dikenakan sanksi administratif atau pidana
4323762 artinya setelah diserahkan ke dprd hasil pemeriksaan bpk menjadi dokumen publik sehingga masyarakat bisa mengetahui hasil pemeriksaan
4323763 silakan konsultasi kepada kami tapi ingat jangan melebihi 60 hari
4323764 kami tidak melakukan ranking hanya melakukan audit jadi ya tidak hafal satu per satu daerah mana saja yang banyak melakukan penyimpangan
4323765 saya rasa di jajaran mana pun pasti ada hal seperti ini namanya mispersepsi saya tidak bilang ada penyimpangan lho ya tapi mungkin hanya mispersepsi yang perlu diklarifikasi
4323766 seringnya pergantian peraturan dapat menimbulkan penyimpangan bagaimana tidak satu peraturan belum dipahami peraturan lain sudah muncul
4323767 jangan melulu diartikan korupsi indikasi ke sana memang ada tapi tidak semua dana disalahgunakan seperti itu
4323768 kemungkinan ada beberapa instansi yang tidak melalui prosedur yang benar akhirnya tercatat dalam bpk sebagai penyimpangan

4323798 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4323799 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4323800 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4323801 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4323802 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4323805 we need to understand that steve bracks made his recommendations prior to the collapse of doha round of world trade talks national secretary dave oliver said
4323806 it makes no sense at all given doha the collapse of world trade talks the global financial crisis and the issue of climate change to consider reducing tariffs

4323809 i havent been contacted by any of the principal people involved in this ive had interactions with tom biscardi in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
4323810 the fact that the two georgian men turned to him and not anyone with scientific credentials is very questionable
4323811 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect even if carcass had have been eviscerated by a predator or a scavenger the entrails wouldnt just be sitting up on top like that
4323812 its about elegance style money and perhaps too heady a mix of drink religion and intrigue

4323885 a statement by the presidential press office said talabani entered the mayo clinic in rochester minnesota on aug 2 for knee surgery but the medical team found out that he suffers from a problem in one of the heart valves
4323886 we thought we could lie but reuters found out the truth broke the story and now we have to admit to the heart surgery

4323894 this report makes clear that too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and to avoid paying their fare share in the united states
4323895 these global companies have now reached a point of power and manipulation where they can decide how much taxes theyre going to pay where theyre going to pay these taxes and when theyre going to pay these taxes

4323916 the fda has no intention to define the term natural for food products any time in the near future saying that it has other priorities in 2007 the agency received two petitions for a clear definition of the term in order to avoid consumer confusion one petition came from the sugar association which wants fda backing for claiming that sugar is a natural sweetener while the second came from baked goods manufacturer sara lee according to sara lee a formal definition is needed to provide consistency for manufacturers and consumers this lack of consistency has led to a wide range of products being claimed as natural claims that have even sparked some lawsuits

4323949 the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4323950 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state

4324029 we hope that we dont miss him very long and well get him back on the mound as soon as he can
4324030 i see no reason why there ought to be so many clubs able to black out in those territories
4324031 thats my intention thats my goal i didnt get any pushback the whole thing is about making the game more popular and available
4324032 i would like to think that if we increase the popularity of baseball
4324033 ill be throwing in a week ill probably throw the beginning of next week
4324034 it would have been different if i wasnt still throwing 99 mph it was a different feeling that i never had so i just wanted to make sure
4324035 thats the only thing you can do in this case
4324036 to be quite honest with you you cant sit here and hang your head about it
4324037 hopefully its not something that goes for an extended period of time
4324038 obviously he wouldnt make that start if joba wouldnt have gone down
4324039 but were expecting him to come up and pitch the way he did in september

4324045 the fact that the activities i had yesterday and the way the knee responded today honestly i do feel positive in the sense that were progressing forward
4324046 pudge has always wanted to play in new york and detroit felt it needed a relief pitcher so both sides were able to get what they wanted to some degree
4324047 i was upset they threw him out of the game because hes really good hittin hes a cute little fella he didnt throw that hard and he doesnt have very good stuff so its probably a good idea they threw him out because it probably wouldve been in monument park
4324048 im just disappointed that he went to the media with this
4324049 we have a good enough relationship that he can talk to me
4324050 its unfortunate that he feels like im addressing it through the media because i really am not
4324051 well gladly move him if we can find someone who wants him and thats where were at
4324052 right now theres been no takers for him theres been no inquiries about him
4324053 i dont want fans to perceive me as a selfish player i hope that theyll understand that i want to play if i cant be out there every day i would like to go and be on a team that has a good chance to go to the world series id like to get back to october baseball
4324054 i feel very honored to wear a yankee cap into the hall of fame today
4324055 i believe some day mr steinbrenner will be here in cooperstown with us
4324056 ive been reading articles lately about george possibly going into the hall of fame and id like to be on that voting committee because i would vote right away for george
4324057 i had 10 years with george as a scout and as an advisor whether you advise george or not i dont know
4324058 but i used to give my opinion and they were 10 wonderful years
4324059 hes already a hall of famer they just havent put him in yet
4324060 latroy gives us another experienced quality arm for our bullpen general manager ed wade said
4324061 we tried to sign him during the off season and lost out to the yankees but we are happy to have him here for the remainder of the season he gives cecil cooper one more weapon to call upon late in the game

4324066 good teacher what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life
4324067 one thing you lack go your way sell whatever you have and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me
4324068 and when these days are expired it shall be that upon the eighth day and so forward the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar and your peace offerings and i will accept you saith the lord god
4324069 you shall keep a feast unto the lord seven days on the first day shall be a sabbath and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath
4324070 on the eighth day you shall have a solemn assembly you shall do no servile work therein but you shall offer a burnt offering a sacrifice made by fire of a sweet savor unto the lord one bull num
4324071 and you shall proclaim on the selfsame day that it may be a holy convocation unto you you shall do no servile work therein it shall be a statute forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations
4324072 god instituted both the edenic sabbath and the new testament sabbath for man at the time of creation and re creation respectively by his own specific example
4324073 peace to you as the father has sent me i also send you
4324074 receive the holy spirit if you forgive the sins of any they are forgiven them if you retain the sins of any they are retained
4324075 unless i see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and put my hand into his side i will not believe
4324076 the first day of the week is sunday and kata is distributive so that we may translate sunday by sunday let each of you lay something aside it is a fair inference that sunday was the day which was set aside for the public worship of the corinthian congregation and that this custom was also followed in galatia and in the other churches that had been founded by paul
4324077 i was in the spirit on the lords day and i heard behind me a loud voice as of a trumpet
4324078 i am he who lives and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore

4324084 if you turn away your foot from the sabbath from doing your pleasure on my holy day and call the sabbath a delight the holy day of the lord honorable and shall honor him not doing your own ways nor finding your own pleasure nor speaking your own words 14 then you shall delight yourself in the lord and i will cause you to ride on the high hills of the earth and feed you with the heritage of jacob your father the mouth of the lord has spoken
4324085 not doing your own ways nor finding your own pleasure nor speaking your own words
4324086 be fruitful and multiply fill the earth and subdue it have dominion over the fish of the sea over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves on the earth
4324087 the day of rest has no meaning apart from the background of labor gods day of rest is the sequel to six days of creative activity and has no relevance in any other context
4324088 take these things away do not make my fathers house a house of merchandise
4324089 you nor your son nor your daughter nor your male servant nor your female servant nor your cattle nor your stranger who is within your gates
4324090 in the old testament the sabbath celebrated and commemorated the passover israels deliverance from egypt since christ the sabbath is dated from the day of resurrection in both cases it is future oriented looking forward to the great restoration of all things
4324091 this verse indirectly establishes the obligation of the sabbath still for the type continues until the antitype supercedes it so legal sacrifices continued till the great antitypical sacrifice superceded it as then the antitypical heavenly sabbath rest will not be till christ comes our gospel joshua to usher us into it the typical earthly sabbath must continue till then
4324092 katapausis in the lxx is used in respect of the uninterrupted and therefore unrepeatable rest of god in gen 2 2 3 and ps 95 11 but sabbatismos is used in ex 16 30 and 2 chr 36 21 to indicate the intermittent and therefore repeatable keeping of a sabbath at regular intervals conclusion the sabbatismos of heb 4 9 which the saved people of god must keep is the intermittent and repeatable sabbath at regular weekly intervals
4324093 there remaineth therefore a sabbath keeping for the people of god
4324094 it took him a couple of days to get used to his surroundings but he had a great week for us thats why we went and got him
4324095 i might have been one of the happiest ones here when we got the trade because ive seen him over the years just being a pain for all the teams that he hits against

4324099 as a child i used to go to a temple and buy a printed paper wish sold at the temple and tie it around the branch of a bush bushes in temple courtyards were always filled with peoples wish knots which looked like white flowers blossoming from afar
4324100 if only i hadnt gone back in time 10 000 years and killed that butterfly hillary clinton would be the nominee if only
4324101 go therefore and make disciples of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit teaching them to observe all things that i have commanded you
4324102 but you will receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you will be my witnesses in jerusalem and in all judea and samaria and to the end of the earth
4324103 we will give to both foreign and local missions but more will go to local missions because our idea is not just to write a check or checks and wipe our hands of it but to be giving regularly to local mission agencies that we can actually visit partner with and do on site service projects with
4324104 theres a difference between pain and stiffness and now just being sore
4324105 i think today when he plays catch will be a big determining factor when he tries to stretch it out a little bit well have a better idea of where hes at and how far hes out

4324119 i mean thats what all teams are trying to do finish first and get into the playoffs
4324120 to be in the position were in we feel obviously very good about that and can hopefully take the next step and put some distance between us and the rest of the people
4324121 for some reason this team historically has been able to bounce back from tough tough losses
4324122 we dont like to have the tough losses but we know that historically they are not going to take that into the next day and that could eventually become a good characteristic for a team thats fighting and heading down the stretch they dont want to let one day lead into the next especially if its a negative feeling or a negative game before that

4324135 people are so worried about the drugs kids get on the streets they dont even think about the drugs at home in the medicine cabinet
4324136 for me to think about not using was like a death sentence
4324137 it was exciting because i would get drugs and get knocked out
4324138 there are risks and costs to action but they are far less than the long range risks of comfortable inaction
4324139 we are increasingly concerned about inaction on the financial challenges facing the social security and medicare programs the longer we wait to address these challenges the more limited will be the options available the greater will be the required adjustments and the more severe the potential detrimental economic impact on our nation
4324140 we didnt have enough money for rent and we moved around a lot
4324141 we had so many guys there but a lot of guys who were isolated rock was the only one with multiple guys there so everyone kind of looked to them to do the work burke swindlehurst was the only other guy that really manned up and started working right away the rest of us let rock do it for a while and that was our undoing if the independents had teamed up with the rocks we would have caught them no problem
4324142 i was jumping all over the place with sevila and everyone i thought i was strong
4324143 it became a really difficult race because it was just jump jump jump sevilla was very aggressive and myself i was a little too aggressive for where im at i guess maybe i didnt drink enough but on the last climb i cramped and i had to limit my losses
4324144 scott touched wheels with someone and went down hard we suspect he may have fractured his collarbone though im not certain about that
4324145 it was just one of those innocuous small accidents that happen sometimes and have a larger impact than we would like
4324146 darren was setting a hard tempo halfway up the climb
4324147 i had orders to stay with whoever went we were riding to protect the jersey so i had the luxury of sitting on most of the time
4324148 they were just ahead of us on that little descent on the last climb we almost had them they were right there they did a tremendous job us three were working and burke swindlehurst was working i wasnt feeling great but sevilla looked good and cesar looked good
4324149 to tell you the truth i thought we were going to get caught at the top of the climb when it was coming down to 20 seconds
4324150 it was down to 20 seconds and i thought two little climbers going on the descent for sure we would be caught pretty quickly but we hit it over the top and i guess they let up a little bit and gave us enough of an advantage to come into the finish
4324151 ian mckissick was in the break with me doing a great job maintaining the pace while i was trying to save myself for the climb
4324152 it was unfortunate that ian punctured 5km from the top of the climb but i was feeling good and at that stage i decided i needed to commit i was just praying for good legs it would have been nice to ride blake off but i think he benefited from sitting on and he had fresher legs after the climb
4324153 baldwin looked like he was breathing through his nose out there today
4324154 i finally rallied everyone to work together but it was really too little too late we should have all sold out earlier
4324155 i regret that decision i really didnt want to give one second to a rider like darren lill right now hes a guy ive been marking the last two days he was one of my favorites going into it good for him two guys doing a ride like that it was really impressive
4324156 when they went i didnt like it but you have to look for the silver lining and hope maybe they will burn a lot of matches and we will catch them at the end when a favorite goes up the road it can go either way on one hand you are giving him time possibly but on the other hand he i using energy for later in the race you have to hope for the latter but today he got time
4324157 mama you dont seem to know much but i like what you do know
4324158 mama why couldnt nanny just pick out two pairs of pajamas and stay in heaven for two nights
4324159 once upon a time there was a princess named sophie
4324160 the longer and longer this negotiation went on the more i could see myself coming back
4324161 i was pretty much ready to go ive matured a lot more since high school and im glad that my decision out of high school was to go to texas
4324162 i didnt really have a specific number of what my price was i just told the white sox that i have no problem with going back to texas i guess thats why this took so long
4324163 we hear a lot about how the linebackers dont do this they dont do that but we know what weve got and we know how hard weve been working
4324164 i think people are going to be surprised at how much better we will be this year im telling you theres a lot of talent at linebacker
4324165 they are bracketed at the middle linebacker spot and are co starters in my eyes
4324166 they are both going to play they are both guys we can win with
4324167 were important i suppose because the secondary is kind of young
4324168 but thats just an excuse everybodys saying the secondary is young we just want to control the line of scrimmage play hard make sure everybody is on the same page because were pretty much the quarterbacks of the defense making sure everybody is doing what theyre supposed to be doing lined up right and everything
4324169 hes got initial quickness hes got good ball get off
4324170 hes a very strong upper body guy so he can power the tackles and hes got god given pass rush ability so youve got to utilize his talents and put him in a situation where he can be successful
4324171 if we mess up were going to play the next play but were going to play it fast and physical no half stepping were just going to try to come out from the start to finish thats what were going to show the fans that were real physical and tough
4324172 i think there were more collisions in that one race than they had all the rest of the night
4324173 a musician a successful musician artistically successful whatever that means
4324174 a hot rod 1937 ford coupe with a flathead is right near the top of the list
4324175 ideally it would be period correct to what a 37 would have been modified to in the early 50s
4324176 eles os telefonemas feitos nos ltimos dias espelham um desejo nosso de tentar aproveitar o que provavelmente uma ltima oportunidade neste momento para concluir a rodada na base do que havia sido acordado sen o por todos por um n mero expressivo de pa ses
4324177 na realidade todos n s ach vamos que o prazo era julho porque esse seria o prazo normal e teria sido se como em outras ocasi es tiv ssemos terminado num desacordo muito grande
4324178 o que faltou para fechar o acordo foi algo relativamente pequeno como voc construir uma catedral e na hora de botar a torre do sino a catedral inteira cair ent o vamos ver se ainda poss vel a gente colocar a torre do sino do jeito certo
4324179 n s procuramos enfatizar que importante que o conselho de seguran a n o seja mudando apenas nos procedimentos mas tamb m na sua composi o
4324180 n o demore muito tempo pela falta de consenso no que toca ao aumento do conselho

4324182 saya pikir valentino telah membuat komentar yang sama dengan apa yang pernah toni ellias lakukan di masa lalu saya pikri saat itu kami bertindak berlebihan
4324183 saya berharap bisa lebih memberikan perlawanan di lap lap terakhir akan sangat baik jika saya bisa memberi tekanan sampai di lap terakhir
4324184 valentino mengatakan kalau tujuh balapan tersisa adalah waktu yang panjang tapi buat saya itu adalah waktu yang singkat kami selalu butuh lebih banyak latihan untuk berusaha mengejar rossi tapi kami hanya bisa melakukan apa yang bisa kami lakukan
4324185 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam pada suatu malam keluar dan shalat di masjid orang orang pun ikut shalat bersamanya dan mereka memperbincangkan shalat tersebut hingga berkumpullah banyak orang ketika beliau shalat
4324186 manakala hadir dalam keadaan sehat dan istiqamah konsisten di atas rute perjalanan menuju allah taala tergantung pada kumpulnya unsur pendukung hati tersebut kepada allah dan menyalurkannya dengan menghadapkan hati tersebut kepada allah taala secara menyeluruh karena kusutnya hati
4324187 artinya dan orang orang yang tidak mampu berpuasa hendaknya membayar fidyah dengan memberi
4324188 any businesses that are out there and are looking for a good night out i would encourage them to support the blue ribbon foundation and wimmera base hospital and purchase a ticket or a table of tickets
4324189 it would be a great night for businesses to spend time with their employees and build bridges with them but it will also allow businesses to build bridges with wimmera base hospital and the police department
4324190 personally i think theyre one of the top three bands in victoria
4324191 it would be a just reward for him and all the dedication and sacrifice he has given the sport over the years since he notched his first major win on the world scene
4324192 no one knows more than i do the amount of sacrifice and dedication he has put in and it would mean so much
4324193 he said everything had gone excellently he was feeling good
4324194 everything has gone very well touch wood but he has had a very good lead up and he said he was very confident of giving a good display
4324195 i am very nervous we would like to see him do well seeing as it is his last effort
4324196 knowing what he has gone through i will be very geed up i think in these cases being a spectator is worse than being a competitor
4324197 then a few years later it turned out to be shane it was a real surprise
4324198 rail is greenhouse friendly and you need to brand it that way if were going to make it work
4324199 things are happening the work on the silver rated lines is promising
4324200 were still looking at what lines to invest in that will be conditional to the commitments made
4324201 we are looking to maintain them not improve them at this stage
4324202 we provide incentives already weve reduced the access charges and provided subsidies
4324203 were unsure of what the government is going to do in upgrading which lines
4324204 it is more than possible that we will take further action to try to get the situation where green lake is available for recreational purposes
4324205 green lake has been a very family friendly environment where children and teenagers can play in relatively safe conditions its close to horsham and its on the highway its a tourism attraction and a great facility
4324206 im pleased that its still being included in the system as a whole and that decisions that are being made at this stage will be reviewed in a five year period but i believe that the community will possibly look at taking this further and possibly with a deputation to the premier
4324207 green lake is recognised as having been an important community asset under historic rainfall conditions however the future supply to green lake is only likely in wetter periods
4324208 for this reason gwmwater intends to work actively with the community to maximise recreation opportunities at lakes such as taylors lake which is more assured of receiving a supply into the future
4324209 when there is excess water green lake should be looked at
4324210 its a real shame green lake is a wonderful venue
4324211 it has trees and stumps and no toilets and no facilities there are some real issues
4324212 our primary commitment and obligation is to securing high security water for the pipeline and our other commitment is to the environment
4324213 the water left in the system is for other high value uses like recreation and tourism
4324214 there might have been trade offs to supply green lake
4324215 what weve seen during the past few years is that more people are going to taylors lake
4324216 taylors lake at the moment is not the right answer but what can we do to taylors lake to address the concerns
4324217 this new way will be a different model that will allow us to increase the resources
4324218 it wasnt available previously but circumstances have changed with the recruitment campaign
4324219 i dont want to go into too much detail because it is still in the early stages but it looks quite promising
4324220 i hope to have a decision within the next month or so
4324221 we are hoping to bring them in and train them up in horsham
4324222 we have now identified a better way of doing our business and this has taken over from the business case
4324223 weve changed the way we are dealing with psychiatric services
4324224 this system has been in place for six weeks it is a clinical solution but its helping significantly
4324225 under the mental health act paramedics cant administer sedation the act is being reviewed and that issue might change
4324226 it allows them to manage mental health patients more efficiently
4324227 until we get a second paramedic service in the wimmera ill still be going to bat for it not only for the community but also for the other staff who have been under enormous pressure
4324228 the students will be visiting the school and taking part in a range of activities including visiting hiroshima kyoto the water temple and universal studios of japan
4324229 it gives the students a really practical focus for learning japanese and it is an amazing cross cultural experience for them
4324230 bq 9000 companies dominate the industry with 75 of biodiesel produced in the us which is a huge achievement
4324231 i think that demonstrates the market power of bq 9000
4324232 we have discovered that sperm behave differently when they encounter this fluid
4324233 for example sperm swim quicker live longer and even the swimming pattern is altered
4324234 this fluid may have a dramatic effect on sperm function as many sperm race against each other in aim to get to the egg first to fertilise the egg
4324235 we were startled to find that female salmon are also able to exert this kind of influence
4324236 we found that the speed of a males sperm varied significantly according to which females ovarian fluid it was swimming in
4324237 it makes sense that when you only have one opportunity to reproduce in your life you want to make sure you get it right
4324238 for the males the race does not always go to the naturally fastest runner as the conditions on the racecourse differ
4324239 whatever it is in this ovarian fluid that is enhancing or retarding sperm function may have a similar effect on sperm in other species
4324240 ho visto una squadra molto timorosa credo che siano nate tante paure tutto quello che siamo riusciti a fare bene per quasi lintera stagione adesso ci riesce difficile
4324241 e adesso prosegue il presidente macchiavelli dobbiamo metterci alle spalle queste paure ricominciare a giocare credo che ci sia ancora lo spazio per rimediare a quel che abbiamo combinato nellultima settimana quando in tre partite abbiamo un po rovinato limmagine di tutta la stagione sono sicuro che i giocatori siano consapevoli di tutto ci in queste ore bisogner lavorare soprattutto di psicologia
4324242 ci siamo parlati a lungo e in maniera decisa penso sia stato un incontro positivo io ho fatto le mie ipotesi sulla crisi didentit nella quale improvvisamente siamo caduti indicando una via duscita in realt prima dellinizio dei playoff avevo gi spiegato chiaramente ai ragazzi che cosa dovevamo fare per giocare al meglio le mie indicazioni non sono state rispettate ho ribadito ora in questo meeting come vanno affrontati i playoff i giocatori sono daccordo con me mi confermano che hanno capito cosa va fatto poi purtroppo in campo non ci si riesce
4324243 un blocco mentale ha fermato la fortitudo tutto cominciato dal terzo inning di venerd 8 agosto contro san marino quanderavamo avanti 7 0 e dunque il mio discorso al gruppo iniziato partendo da l da quel momento cercando di capire come sia stato possibile per una squadra esperta come la nostra perdere totalmente il controllo e smettere nello spazio duna settimana di giocare a baseball
4324244 si pu perdere certo io non contesto la situazione di una vittoria e di tre partite perse in questavvio di playoff perch bisogna tener conto che ci sono anche gli avversari ma non posso assolutamente accettare la maniera vergognosa con la quale sono arrivate le tre sconfitte questo non mi sta bene non posso vedere un ginanneschi che tira un perfect game per cinque inning una no hit per sei inning io solitamente non alzo la voce ma alla terza ripresa mercoled lho anche fatto con la speranza di dare una scossa non si possono perdere tre partite in modo cos vergognoso punto e basta
4324245 se gli avversari vincono perch si dimostrano pi bravi ne prendiamo atto
4324246 one problem with liquor is that it is always the subject of a conscience vote in parliament
4324247 this does not help indeed it is hard to see why liquor should be the subject of a conscience vote the fact that it always has been in hardly a good reason
4324248 it there were not a conscience vote it would certainly assist in securing a coherent consistent and rational framework for dealing with a substance that imposes significant social costs on new zealand
4324249 i understand its under control were just waiting for a further report
4324250 we need to understand that steve bracks made his recommendations prior to the collapse of doha round of world trade talks national secretary dave oliver said

4324261 i dont know id say the barrels only about 100 square feet id say 10 by 10
4324262 i mean we clean the windows every day and you can hardly see through em
4324263 i was reading this health book today and it said our bodies need a little oil
4324264 put in new plumbing and made it functional put in a new grill new cold table
4324265 that one doesnt even work anymore but we left it on there in case we had to get out of there you know what i mean
4324266 yeah whats a burger without cheese it didnt have cheese and the old cow up on the sign we repainted the cow
4324267 sir i havent been here in two days and all i got is six tater tots
4324268 somebody run into that the other day and he said i couldnt see it
4324269 and i said no just keep eatin here im not charging for a picnic table
4324270 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases we believe the proposed penalties are excessive
4324271 when this thing comes out its going to be shocking ive never seen anything like this before
4324272 i havent been contacted by any of the principal people involved in this ive had interactions with tom biscardi in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
4324273 the fact that the two georgian men turned to him and not anyone with scientific credentials is very questionable
4324274 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect even if carcass had have been eviscerated by a predator or a scavenger the entrails wouldnt just be sitting up on top like that
4324275 we know we are more than just neurons firing or at least we think we are while the neurons are firing
4324276 ill still do the baltimore and new york series for the herald and should start with the globe at the beginning of next month
4324277 the idea is to have a bit of a hybrid position between the web site and the paper with an on line emphasis
4324278 it will be largely baseball to start but theres no real restrictions on this position there are million things to do with it there will be a lot of trial and error
4324279 this issue of what my job title would be came up during talks with sullivan
4324280 i dont know if there is one for what ill be doing and i dont care if there isnt
4324281 evetually i had to look at it and say that weei com is a start up the boston globe is a long established media outlet and theyre not going anywhere
4324282 i couldnt see leaving a place i had been for almost 20 years to go to what is basically a start up
4324283 ive literally known hank herald since i was 17 years old
4324284 the hardest part of this whole thing was leaving the
4324285 this is a progressive and proactive attempt to integrate the paper and the web
4324286 its nice to be talking about an addition for a change
4324287 hell make the patriots nervous and im sure bill belichick will be pissed off having him back around
4324288 borges is someone who compels you to log on and read what he has written yeah hes stubbed his toe a few times but he knows what hes doing and hes still extremely well connected throughout the league
4324289 im not sure how much cross pollenization there will be
4324290 but i missed him i compare it to a double play combination that gets separated because of injury or trade you lose that comfort level
4324291 the most important thing we do all year long the jimmy fund telethon
4324292 more than anything it exposed a human side of gerry and i dont mean this derogatorily but there is the tough gruff exterior than accompanies gerry on the surface
4324293 he was scared to death and was facing mortality and everything that comes with it
4324294 that was actually a good distraction for me from gerrys situation
4324295 i still had to make sure that no matter who i was on with that we were doing a good show
4324296 people now expect this event theres no need to explain it to people any more they know it they look forward to it and they realize what its about
4324297 it will be tough to reach that goal with the gas prices are the political climate the on coming concern of winter heating bills
4324298 but this touches everybody during the kick off on thursday the phones were ringing off the hook
4324299 do not be sad indeed allah swt is with us
4324300 it was not you who killed them but allah slew them neither was it you who threw at them allah threw at them in order that he confers on the believers a fair benefit indeed allah is hearing knowing
4324301 honor power and glory belong to allah to his messenger and to the believers but the hypocrites know not
4324302 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
4324303 however robert dudley remains chief executive pending completion of the appeal process
4324304 robert dudley has bps full support we believe this is a further example of the administrative activities orchestrated by the other shareholders of tnk bp
4324305 a decision on the second claim was taken today it resulted in disqualification for two years
4324306 this is another example of the sort of administrative interference which i referred to when i left russia
4324307 they will discuss issues related to structure management including personnel changes and the ipo
4324308 those are things were investigating right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4324309 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4324310 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4324311 you dont ever know about people but thats the last thing in the world i would have ever considered
4324312 he was not a person of a lot of words but he did carry on conversations
4324313 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4324314 i think what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of u s russian relations
4324315 my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4324316 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4324317 confirmed that the risks are on the downside for growth
4324318 the french economy is not just going through some simple turbulence but is really heading toward a recession at least as bad as in 1993

4324339 but she was a very effective person in the job she had
4324340 her drive and inherent cheerfulness despite long hours of tedious work served as a spur to greater effort for those working with her
4324341 its heartbreaking to think something like that would happen here

4324375 one of the wonderful constants about the frick is the character of display in the living hall which is faithfully evocative of its original appearance some of our greatest holdings are in the room and we are eager to maintain the original high quality of display so we are very pleased to embark on a brief much needed refurbishment of that gallery conservator joseph godla will supervise the project which involves a treatment of the elaborate early eighteenth century inspired wood paneling as well as maintenance of the floors and installation of a new carpet which replicates one now decades old and threadbare in the meantime we are very pleased to have the opportunity to examine rephotograph and temporarily alter the display of these great treasures

4324380 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to

4324397 it also is important to understand at the outset that our task in this proceeding is not to decide whether we believe as a matter of policy that the officially recognized relationship of a same sex couple should be designated a marriage rather than a domestic partnership or some other term but instead only to determine whether the difference in the official names of the relationships violates the california constitution

4324928 a poets advice by e e cummings a real human is somebody who feels and who expresses his or her feelings this may sound easy it isnt a lot of people think or believe or know what they feel but thats thinking or believing or knowing not feeling and being real is feeling not just knowing or believing or thinking almost anybody can learn to think or believe or know but its very difficult to learn to feel why because whenever you think or you believe or you know youre a lot of other people but the moment you feel youre nobody but yourself to be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best night and day to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight and never stop fighting as for communicating nobody but yourself to others that means working just a little harder than anybody who isnt real can possibly imagine why because nothing is quite as easy as just being just like somebody else we all of us do exactly this nearly all of the time and whenever we do it we are not real if at the end of your first ten or fifteen years of fighting and working and feeling you find youve loved just once with a nobody but yourself heart youll be very lucky indeed and so my advice to all young people who wish to become real is do something easy like dreaming of freedom unless youre ready to commit yourself to feel and work and fight till you die i think what this says is important on a lot of levels definitely a reflection of my aspirations and goals not only in writing but also in life its hard to be yourself in the face of social competition surrounded by most people that blindly conform into whatever is easiest coolest acceptable popular i am guilty of this a lot of the time its nearly impossible to be yourself 100 of the time however when you find yourself in love whether its with a person a place or an art youre closer than ever for instance in a song is where im most myself capturing all my emotions in my own little melting pot of self when you find yourself in a moment in time when nothing else matters but that moment and you and yours in that moment alone youre real youre free thats the feeling i get when i write when onstage on a particularly magical night when mike and i finish a song when i lay in bed with her for hours well into the afternoon when i cry and laugh at the same time when no one is around in these moments alone im real im free

4325177 if we make a difference in one soldiers life and possibly that of his or her children we have been successful but to impact so many soldiers and families is simply overwhelming and fills the heart with pride

4325184 i have been married 15 years to the most wonderful man he is a great provider a great father and a great friend my husband has been a terrific companion to me for all these years in fact i would say our love has gotten even stronger every day we have been married we get along great and always have a good time together i would say our marriage is perfect in every way except one our love life has gone downhill in the past few years when we were first together the romance was fiery we made passionate love every night sometimes two or three times we were like rabbits we couldnt stand to be together and not make love we had sex in the car on the elevator in the park wherever the mood struck us my husband was so hot and he was such a stud i couldnt keep my hands off of him and i loved his hands on me every time we had sex i came he was just so long and hard he had amazing control so we could do it for hours in those first months i had trouble walking sometimes after all our after dark activity but as he has gotten older his equipment doesnt work as well as it used to his dick doesnt get as hard or stay hard as long as i need it to so i can come i end up leaving each sexual encounter feeling frustrated instead of satisfied i dont think i need to tell you ladies that if things arent coming together in the bedroom it throws everything in the relationship off i want my sexy rock hard husband back i want him to take me in the bedroom like the strong stallion he used to be i am not ready to have the sex life of an old woman married to an old man i am a vibrant healthy woman and i need to have regular orgasms to stay happy you know how men are they get upset if they think there is a problem with their dick they feel like they are less of a man i felt like i had to find a solution for him that wouldnt involve an embarrassing trip to the doctor i mean come on ladies no one has a husband who will willingly go to the doctor to discuss erectile dysfunction this is a problem that needs to be handled delicately i needed a solution to turn my husband back into the stud he once was without embarrassing him or making me go any longer without good sex i had seen some commercials for male supplements but the commercials looked questionable one was pretty funny but it didnt tell me how it worked i really wanted to find something that worked the first time my husband wouldnt be able to deal with trying a bunch of different pills and have nothing work hed start to ask questions about why i was pushing this stuff then wed argue everyone would end up pissed off i was trying to get the lovin going not a fight once i found www mojorisen com i knew i had the answer to my problem they sell a male enhancement supplement to make my husbands dick rock hard again the supplement is safe legal and available without a prescription it also didnt have some of the dangerous herbs the other supplements have while i wanted our sex life i certainly didnt want to make my husband sick also it can be taken with alcohol so if we had a romantic dinner with wine it would still work the mojo risen would be delivered in an unmarked package and had a 100 iron clad money back guarantee i hoped i wouldnt need that guarantee i have to tell you i got a little aroused just thinking of using it i placed my order and anxiously waited for the supplement to arrive fortunately it got here really quickly i greeted my husband at the door after work wearing little more than a smile and holding a glass of champagne i slipped him the supplement and started to kiss him he looked at me questioningly but when i moved his hand to my butt he just went with the flow we fooled around for about 30 minutes and next thing we knew his dick was hard as a rock to show him how thrilled i was i did that thing i only do once it awhile that really got him going we didnt even make it upstairs to the bedroom we had mindblowing sex for hours right in the living room i came over and over again and he was able to come back for more and more and more after we were too exhausted to move my husband asked me what the pill had been i told him it was a supplement from www mojorisen com he was amazed that such a small supplement was strong enough to pack such a punch he said he felt like we were newlyweds the next morning the supplement was still working as i could tell from his rock hard morning wood i surprised him by getting started before he woke up he loved it the next time he took the supplement we had sex like a couple of horny teenagers over and over again all over the house my stallion was back he had no side effects from mojo risen he felt great and we both were so happy it is like we turned back time we got our sex life back without any embarrassing doctor visits or filling embarrassing prescriptions i was able to help my husband without making him feel like he was inadequate as a lover we agreed that we would always have them on hand my sex life is too important to me to miss out on all this hot fun
4325185 but what can be more obnoxious than forcing taxpayers to underwrite other peoples political opinions as thomas jefferson told us to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions that he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical youd think someone who postures as an opponent of special interests and government pork wouldnt expect the taxpayers to subsidize his own very special interest political campaign
4325186 it wont be senators barack obama or john mccain both of whom are creatures of the washington establishment sen obama talks about a new politics but his policies look an awful lot like the old liberalism sen mccain says he is a maverick but that doesnt include getting his own political party off of the federal dole when he does break with his own party he lines up with the democrats whenever the issue is individual rights versus government power he chooses government power

4325305 we are really excited about this new build process for space vehicles and its impressive results and our air force customer is pleased to have the gps spacecraft used for this new process
4325306 with 12 satellites on order the gps program is ideal for a manufacturing pulse line because similar satellites can easily adapt to a process that mirrors mass production
4325307 the value of a pulse line is that it increases efficiency and therefore enables us to reduce costs as we continue to simplify our satellite designs in order to standardize the items that are inherent in every spacecraft built by boeing the implementation of a pulse line will yield tremendous benefits in the areas of efficiency and cost savings

4325390 all of orthodoxy is found in the bible but much of it in passages we didnt underline when we were evangelicals
4325391 how can i understand what i am reading unless some one guides me
4325392 no prophecy of scripture is a matter of ones own interpretation
4325393 all these different groups i e protestant evangelical on the basis of sola scriptura took their bibles in hand and went off in a different direction in many cases anathematizing all the others
4325394 i am willing to discuss our differences on the basis of the text of scripture by itself
4325395 the traditions which you were taught by paul his companions and or the other apostles either by word of mouth or by letter
4325396 christs words in scripture rule out the possibility that the church visible and historical will ever completely disappear from the face of the earth
4325397 therefore while rome may have become apostate i dont think it has but there are orthodox who do there must be a visible historical church on earth today which is organizationally continuous with the church of the apostles and in fact is itself the church of the apostles
4325398 organizationally continuous with the church of the apostles and in fact is itself the church of the apostles

4325409 if christ in john 6 wasnt speaking of the eucharist why did he speak in terms that anyone impartial or objective and familiar with christianity then or now would immediately understand in light of what he said and did at the last supper is he trying to fool us im sure you dont believe that but in your haste to deny the real presence because like calvin you cant cope with the worship of the consecrated bread and wine which logically follows
4325410 john 6 is not about the lords supper rather the lords supper is about what is described in john 6

4325425 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4325426 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer

4325479 through no fault of his that legal representation was not there
4325480 the offender concedes that the images fall into categories eight to 10
4325481 the secret of life is sharing the passage of time
4325482 one hour after they drank red bull their blood systems were no longer normal they were abnormal like we would expect in a patient with cardiovascular disease
4325483 the study does not show effects which would go beyond that of drinking a cup of coffee therefore the reported results were to be expected and lie within the normal physiological range
4325484 mommy i saw some ladies with boobies a lot bigger than yours
4325485 mommy i saw some men with dongs a lot bigger than daddys
4325486 moi je ne suis pas raciste ceux que je n aime pas ce sont les cons
4325487 dont become obsessed with the little things so that we are incapable of great things
4325488 we confess our little faults to persuade people that we have no large ones
4325489 there are no secrets to success it is the result of preparation hard work and learning from failure
4325490 success is never final and failure is never fatal its courage that counts
4325491 the day people stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them
4325492 we judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing while others judge us by what we have done
4325493 it is often merely for an excuse that we say things are impossible
4325494 if you are always trying to please other people youll never know true self confidence
4325495 dance as though no one is watching you love as though you have never been hurt before sing as though no one can hear you live as though heaven is on earth
4325496 fox dont go to sleep you might be in shock and i dont want to be sleeping next to a dead guy tonight just relax for a bit but dont go to sleep
4325497 you can ask me anything i swear i will answer truthfully
4325498 why dont you have any answers you seem to know where im heading you must know something
4325499 i dont have any answers because i can only see where the path goes not whats down it
4325500 weve found towns that no longer exist we see wagon trails and areas where no wagon trails ever existed
4325501 a more than 30 million donation to the church of jesus christ of latter day saints for the restoration of the nauvoo temple
4325502 its an expensive endeavor but worthwhile because when factions learn that they share a common ancestry that jewish israelis are related to palestinians sunnis to shiites there will be peace on earth
4325503 we can f ck forever but you will never get my soul
4325504 a lot of investors who have been buying commodities not just on a global growth story but as a hedge against a weak dollar are unloading those commodities based on a much more constrained global outlook and going back into the u s dollar
4325505 i will not bring home something that i cant wash off
4325506 la lucha contra la impunidad tiene vigencia en el salvador y aunque las instancias nacionales no coadyuvan para hacer posible la justicia pronta hacia las v ctimas s tenemos la esperanza en el sistema interamericano de derechos humanos
4325507 la fuerza armada debe de saber qu ocurri con los desaparecidos y el estado y el gobierno est obligado por humanidad a colaborar para saber d nde est n o qu pas
4325508 la b squeda de justicia en casos como de los desaparecidos o de v ctimas de masacres o asesinatos en la poca del conflicto es un tema tab para la justicia y por eso no se investiga
4325509 the numbers are the worst weve seen and its not just the magnitude of the problem but the scope so many markets are affected
4325510 loan officers are reporting that they are still tightening underwriting standards
4325511 you have another wave of anxiety another tightening of credit
4325512 the idea that well have a second half of the year recovery has gone by the boards
4325513 i was a relative optimist but ive certainly become more pessimistic
4325514 the financial system looks substantially worse now than it did a month ago if the freddie and fannie bailout were to fail it could get a hell of a lot worse if we get more bank failures we have the possibility of seeing more of these pictures of people standing in line to pull their money out that could really scare consumers
4325515 we havent seen this kind of travail in the financial markets since the 1930s
4325516 hi im from windows and im not selling anything but i have some information for you

4325521 yo brandon we have about 2 hours till we board our flight and i am loosing my sanity because of how boring it is lets check out the liquor store
4325522 i should really be going to sleep right about now
4325523 i wish the people in the house accross the road would turn their living room light off its obvious they arent in there
4325524 oh baby please insert your part a into my orifice b my orifice b is so hot for you
4325525 a person should read a little bit every day so as not to lose that part of the self we call soul
4325526 thats one of the reasons why theres alot of overweight obese people here in the states because all of these machines
4325527 that guy will never do anything that girl is just a waste of space
4325528 what are your motives for pushing the issue commissioner daniels
4325529 ive trained dwayne wade lebron kobe kobes close but michaels intensity has never been matched by anyone that ive worked with
4325530 la no viol ncia en mi s un fet de la vida basat en lexperi ncia constant
4325531 ok lets do this because she isnt eating or drinking
4325532 can we wait she ate an egg and some cheese at lunch maybe shell feel better
4325533 i am sooo not ready for this cant we wait a little
4325534 the employer might not explain the reason for the firing so its difficult to get accurate statistics on how often it happens
4325535 a world without tomatoes is like a string quartet without violins

4325538 my son was in the boat crying hes wondering why we werent in there
4325539 it was scary just for the fact that youre helpless
4325540 my son hes fine hes just wondering why we didnt go fishing
4325541 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4325542 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4325543 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4325544 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4325545 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4325546 what defenses does georgia have because of the cease fire agreement which russia has not honored georgian troops are being moved to organize a defensive line 10 kilometers six miles away from tbilisi
4325547 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4325548 we have him in our freezer and unnamed experts are looking at it
4325549 i asked them how many of you have been shot at and at that moment all the kids raise their hands whether or not it was true they had this bonding moment where they were pulling up their shirts and showing where theyd been knifed and showing where theyd been hit
4325550 when erin took the kids to the holocaust museum it proved to be a huge bonding experience for them
4325551 similarly when we were first getting to know each other during the first week of rehearsals we went to the museum and it was the exact same experience for us we bonded strongly over how those stories affected us it was definitely life imitating art at that point
4325552 i had an amazing father my dad was a civil rights activist in the u s and as a kid we talked a lot about equality and fighting for the underdog my dad always said you should judge a batter by his swing and not by the color of his skin
4325553 im gonna make this lady cry in front of the whole class
4325554 daaamn girl can i have some fries with that shake
4325555 i then read the book of diaries written by the students
4325556 and immediately called my producer stacey sher and told her that this was a project we had to do
4325557 initially this became the it movie for all hollywood actresses
4325558 though over the six years every actress approached us cameron diaz reese witherspoon sandra bullock ashley judd kate hudson everyone and unwaveringly i said no i want hilary swank when she was given this role it was such an emotional thing for her because she did not graduate from high school she has her ged i so honor her for saying i dont care about the money she took a very sizable pay cut to do this film
4325559 teach with your heart lessons i learned from the freedom writers

4325564 its going to make you feel all warm and fuzzed out
4325565 and i shall love you forever and for a thousand times more
4325566 i just want to leave here marry you have our kids and be free just you and me and 1200 roses
4325567 ill ruin your life you bitch dont think i wont
4325568 let me leave you out here for a little bit and see how it feels to be left you fucking cunt
4325569 you want to laugh i will give you something to laugh about
4325570 yeah i am fucking leaving and i am not coming back
4325571 youll never put your hands on me again youll never look at me again youll never see me walkin through that door and you will never ever hurt me again you fucking got it
4325572 all i can do is be me whoever that is
4325573 i will be working on the project titled open source parallel database

4325578 i guess a wider spread of the specs in a true
4325579 apparently there are several boards available for this but many would prefer to pay more and start from a running system like in the old days when you wanted to develop investigate some new pc based hardware device you would do so on your standard pc with all the advantages of the running proven system available for conventient i o
4325580 so also a version of the simputer open box with convenient external psu connector s and extendable facilities would be of great value to many and involve negligible additional development cost to the simputer marketers
4325581 it is now in existence and is seeking membership from women in uganda
4325582 very proud to have epic join the growing roster of ea partners
4325583 epic is excited to work with ea partners to launch our next big ip on the global stage ea partners gives independent developers like epic the muscle of a global publisher like ea along with the focus and flexibility of a smaller team committed to working with our individual needs
4325584 the latest surge must be working maybe i have finally got the upper hand on these jerk wads after all
4325585 god how i love the smell of cypermethrin in the morning
4325586 i need to find somebody to help create this game because it will be a great game
4325587 we like that exact idea we dont want the other one
4325588 we want to lead the charge into a new genre of gaming and turn sackboy into the next emblematic character for the ps3

4325590 will the plane be held still or will it move
4325591 for the candidates this is their opportunity to address the national convention of americas oldest major veterans organization and the nations largest organization of combat veterans
4325592 what the vfw membership wants to know is how each candidate would prosecute the war on terrorism and protect america through strong national defense and homeland security programs we also want to know how they would enhance military and veteran healthcare programs benefits and quality of life initiatives
4325593 including 2 2 million military service personnel and all of our spouses and adult age children brings the nations veteran family to well over 50 million americans
4325594 a fifth of the nations adult population is a voting bloc that absolutely cannot be ignored by any politician at any level regardless of political party
4325595 you can argue that it was the highlight of his career
4325596 he said he was fearful of doing television because aside from the ed sullivan exposure television had been a fiasco for him
4325597 wed start shooting at 9 or 10 in the morning and go until we were done then hed go into his living quarters and invite friends and theyd jam to all hours of the morning
4325598 i was amazed by all the energy enthusiasm and fun going on after a hard days work
4325599 he didnt know what he was going to do i knew he was going to pull out some of the old songs wed done that kind of thing but that was it
4325600 theres usually only three or four good ones and thats it
4325601 i cant tell you how many things are wrong with things like that
4325602 its not good we were blessed by very little knowledge of it
4325603 willie aames flat broke penniless star cant even buy daughter a birthday present
4325604 i never understood why they left and i never understood why dick dale was here
4325605 engaged in the business of discovering and developing artists in the music industry
4325606 hes right society is plastic empty foolish vacant and maybe the only way to feel anything anymore is to punch someone in the snoot then ask them to punch you back
4325607 no tyler durden wants to tear down everything and tearing down never accomplishes anything
4325608 there was never any proof that he was a member of the nazi party and there was never any proof that he gave into the wants of the regime
4325609 there is evidence that he got jewish musicians out of germany though his contacts with high level nazi officials now does that mean he was rubbing noses with the nazis probably
4325610 youre either a collaborator with a horrifying regime or youre not
4325611 he operates on a pretty simplistic algorithm his equation is if youre in a country with a totalitarian regime certainly one as horrifying as the nazi regime you are either crushed by it or you get out of there or you fight it and if you dont do one of those things youre a collaborator
4325612 surrounded by the rubble of a city flattened by allied bombs
4325613 life is short life is dull life is full of pain
4325614 we were meant for each other and not meant for each other
4325615 the guys get together to play to write and listen to each other
4325616 theres such a good nucleus of younger talent in kansas city
4325617 that everybody stays with each other and helps each other out its a good place to be
4325618 the students stay close because its such a good environment to learn how to play
4325619 everybodys real positive and there are no jerks in the program its nice to hang with guys who are real serious about playing and real positive about it
4325620 im writing all the time and big band is probably my favorite format
4325621 about half the book is mine trombonist kevin cerovich has a couple of things paul roberts just dropped off a couple of charts gerald spaits has some that he wants to do and ben leifers been writing kerry strayer has donated about 10 charts
4325622 weve got benny carters kansas city suite which he did for count basie
4325623 weve got some other riff tunes and basie style things
4325624 its a lot more like the 90s era of hip hop where there was a lot of sampling and not necessarily knowledge rap but a lot of real live down to earth type of natural experience stuff from an mc as opposed to flashy things or gangsta killing spree material
4325625 had a good childhood now they want to take my black away i aint from the hood now they want to take my rap away
4325626 using false credentials to get jobs or to get state certification for various jobs jeopardizes the health and safety of pennsylvania residents
4325627 this facility brings almost all the services you need from the hospital and the health campus to the southern county so theres very few reasons you would have to travel to the hospital or health campus after this facility
4325628 when this thing comes out its going to be shocking ive never seen anything like this before
4325629 i havent been contacted by any of the principal people involved in this ive had interactions with tom biscardi in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
4325630 the fact that the two georgian men turned to him and not anyone with scientific credentials is very questionable
4325631 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect even if carcass had have been eviscerated by a predator or a scavenger the entrails wouldnt just be sitting up on top like that
4325632 you should see all the spiders we get in our boat
4325633 who should come to claim the throne but king of carrion the crow his darkness grows as he licks the skeletons white and gleam
4325634 god only knows how we made it this far everybody knows we must be monsters too
4325635 desde nuestra asociaci n nos esforzamos por lograr que las mujeres victimas de violencia familiar sobre todo las que se encuentran en riesgo de muerte comprendan que esto no es amor y se alejen a tiempo del agresor
4325636 miles de mujeres v ctimas de violencia recibieron el mensaje suberticio de que deben perdonar a sus maridos agresores y soportar lo insoportable
4325637 si esta informaci n que publicaron el d a de hoy es producto de un desconocimiento de la problem tica de la violencia familiar les rogamos que se informen y asesoren
4325638 is there a moment in your life that illustrates how youre always happy a story you could tell that would show us that element of your personality
4325639 do you see the difference how when he just says hes happy its not nearly as effective as what he demonstrated when he told us about his brother
4325640 while watching the olympics opening night ceremonies i was delighted to see that printing was highlighted as one of ancient chinas four great inventions
4325641 we consider dip pen nanolithography which is nanotechnologys version of the quill pen and now polymer pen lithography to be two of northwesterns most important inventions
4325642 we can go in a sense from an ultra fine point sharpie to one with a fat tip
4325643 the tip of each polymer pen starts with nanometer scale sharpness but if we press down harder the tip flattens out this gives us great flexibility in the structures we can produce
4325644 the man who can drive himself further once the effort gets painful is the man who will win
4325645 it atmosphere was a little different because it is kind of a home game for us but is so close to pittsburgh that a lot of pittsburgh fans drove to the game
4325646 i think its going to do well for the nfl
4325647 we have to get the crowd a little bit more into it and it happens with time
4325648 when the regular season comes its going to be different because the first team will be out there for the whole game
4325649 but to be up here with the fans has been awesome
4325650 its an exhibition game and in buffalo these are 60 tickets and they want 500 for them here
4325651 id definitely be selling more tickets if i was at a hockey arena
4325652 the poor who sell their organs are being exploited whether by richer people within their own countries or by transplant tourists from abroad
4325653 the legacy of transplantation must not be the impoverished victims of organ trafficking and transplant tourism but rather a celebration of the gift of health by one individual to another
4325654 its a phosphorylation switch controlled by doubletime that determines whether the protein is active at all
4325655 if you cant phosphorylate the first site you automatically skip to the second site phosphorylate it prematurely and produce a hyperactive repressor
4325656 with a repressor that acts too soon and goes away too quickly you get a short period phenotype
4325657 many of the features that theyre seeing in humans are consistent with what were finding in flies
4325658 so it may help us understand the human syndrome as well
4325659 canadas housing market is running into some seriously foul weather amid the weakest affordability in nearly two decades
4325660 we opined a month ago that given the steep run up in new listings double digit sales declines and the sharp drop in consumer sentiment price declines may become a more common feature across the country in the months ahead these latest figures simply pound home that point while we still doubt that canada will stage an instant replay of the trauma in u s markets even a mild version would be bad news
4325661 the combination of a larger inventory of homes for sale and fewer home sales means less upward pressure on home prices in many markets
4325662 the challenge for many sellers is determining the right price for todays market conditions there is no doubt the canadian real estate market is pulling back from the record sales and price increase levels of 2007
4325663 a big challenge for biological therapeutics is that they are broken down rapidly in the body the technology developed by asterion ltd is based on basic structural biology work that has provided us with the knowledge necessary to develop longer acting drugs this is a major advantage for patients as it means monthly injections rather than daily injections
4325664 our patented and versatile therapeutic platform technology profuse tm could also tackle major diseases such as some cancers anaemia infertility and diabetes under normal circumstances hormones of the type known as cytokine hormones growth hormone for example circulate in the blood and are bound to proteins that prevent them from being degraded the basic structural biology work we have done in the past means that we can see the interaction between the hormone and the binding protein in exquisite detail our understanding of this structural information means that we can rationally design drugs that consist of this pairing of hormone and binding protein that still allows them to activate the cell surface receptor in this situation the hormone portion of the drug is better protected in the circulation from degradation and so it has a much longer effective life in the body
4325665 i think everybody has had an occasion where their physician did a test and they just didnt hear back
4325666 people identify that as a common experience the incident reports we received voluntarily from family physicians and their office staff detail what the problem areas are
4325667 theres a fair amount of risk and harm that results from testing mistakes and slips
4325668 one of the most striking and disturbing findings was that minority patients were nearly three times more likely to experience adverse consequences
4325669 while significant physical harm was rare adverse consequences for patients were common
4325670 this study strongly supports the need for office by office improvements in the overall testing process within primary care
4325671 since many errors are undetected or unreported we can assume this is an extreme lower bound
4325672 and cautions against the over reliance on current technological systems
4325673 this is especially true for low income youth for youth in the juvenile justice and child welfare systems ethnic minority youth and those with drug and or alcohol problems
4325674 understandably one of the most common questions posed by breast cancer survivors is what are the chances of it coming back
4325675 now we can tell some women within a certain percentage their future risk of recurrence and clinicians may be able to make more informed decisions regarding prescription of extended adjuvant endocrine therapy
4325676 the magnitude of risk of recurrence should indicate a need for us to consider extended endocrine treatment for eligible women to further lower their risks
4325677 the offender concedes that the images fall into categories eight to 10
4325678 xgnp can either be used as an additive to plastics or by itself it can make a transformational change in the performance of many advanced electronic and energy devices
4325679 it can do so because its a nanoparticle with a unique shape made from environmentally benign carbon and it can be made at a very reasonable cost
4325680 now that we know how to make this material and how to modify it so that it can be utilized in plastics
4325681 our attention is being directed to high end applications where we can really make some substantial changes in the way electronics fuel cells batteries and solar cells perform as a result of using this material
4325682 as an engineer we do research with an eye on not only understanding the fundamentals of how things work but also on coming up with solutions to solve important problems facing the world we live in
4325683 this project goes beyond doing research and publishing papers it appears to have made the transition from a laboratory curiosity to a commercial product and simultaneously has helped create a spinoff company to increase the economic viability of michigan
4325684 plants are dying out at the bottom of their ranges and at the tops of their ranges they seem to be growing in and doing much better
4325685 the only thing that could explain this happening across the entire face of the mountain would be a change in the local climate
4325686 i was surprised by how nice the data looked and how unambiguous the signal was
4325687 it is clear that ecosystems can respond rather rapidly to climate change
4325688 the plants should still be in a recovery phase where they are growing back in
4325689 but they have stopped recovering and now are dying which these plants should not be doing
4325690 the fact that we saw this abnormal difference in gene expression in at least 10 percent of the colon cancer patients and in very few people without colon cancer strongly suggests that it plays an important role in this disease
4325691 moreover if this difference is found in patients with colon cancer it should prompt a study of other family members who as determined by genetic counseling are likely to have also inherited the trait
4325692 it is possible that testing for this abnormal expression may become part of clinical practice when evaluating a patients colon cancer risk
4325693 we and others must now determine the molecular cause of the difference so that we can begin to design ways to correct it and perhaps eliminate the elevated risk of cancer
4325694 in fact when you look at the creek a lot of times you have trouble even seeing any water
4325695 the evolutionary biology of fishes in general and the genetic integrity of the two native fishes in particular
4325696 it took a lot of detective work by a lot of people
4325697 and what we found was really an intriguing pattern of genetics
4325698 we have interesting fish like the flannelmouth and bluehead suckers not many people see them admittedly but we have these really interesting and different fish in the rivers of the west and this white sucker could come in and turn everything into one kind of a mutt fish

4325700 cardiac hypertrophy or enlargement of the heart muscle cells is a hallmark of top athletes especially rowers and is a physical adaptation to increased cardiac load during prolonged periods of exercise our results show both the left and right sides of the rowers hearts are larger and function at an enhanced capacity compared to those of the controls the causes of this strengthening of athletes heart muscle are not completely clear it could be due to the production of growth factors such as igf 1 during training in fact physical exercise is associated with cardiac haemodynamic changes pressure and volume overload able to stimulate the production of growth factors by stretching myocardial fibers
4325701 to this end we investigated levels of the hormone insulin like growth factor 1 igf 1 and found significantly increased levels in the rowers compared to the control group although in both groups igf 1 levels were within the normal range furthermore higher igf 1 levels in the rowers bloodstream correlated significantly with better heart performance these results highlight a possible biochemical mechanism for cardiac hypertrophy in elite rowers and suggest a potentially beneficial role for igf 1 in the remodelling of the heart muscle this could mean that naturally increased production of igf 1 occurring as an adaptation to prolonged training influences biochemical processes that control contraction of the heart muscle in rowers further research is now needed to determine the exact relationship between higher production of igf 1 and cardiac output in elite rowers
4325702 screening for depression during pregnancy is important for this population group given latinas high rates of fertility and births to single women particularly among more acculturated u s born latinas
4325703 the sample for this study was a low income population
4325704 our conclusions may or may not be different for women in other socioeconomic status ses groups hence more research needs to be conducted among latinas from differing ses groups including research focusing on the role of social support and cultural values beliefs related to childbirth and pregnancy among latinas
4325705 the higher prevalence rate of depression in americanized latina women is of concern in our community as the population demographics clearly indicate a significant rate of growth of this group in their childbearing years
4325706 thus it is important to more clearly understand the circumstances that affect their physical and emotional well being during pregnancy so that preventive measures can be initiated this is critical for the overall health of both the mother and child

4325725 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4325726 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4325727 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4325728 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4325729 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4325790 i thought the audience walked out on the high film frame rate because it was too realistic now youre saying they cant tell the difference must have been an audience of supermen eh
4325791 the point where you cant tell the difference anymore is somewhere over 72 fps
4325792 personally i hate the jerky 24 fps film look id take 60 or 72 fps any day
4325793 flicker is noticed more with computer displays due to the white sheet of paper model flat white areas appear to flicker more than dark
4325794 another movie he directed brainstorm was originally designed to highlight a projection technology he was promoting the movie was about recording experiences in the film the recorded experiences were going to be played at 48 frames per second as opposed to the standard 24 frames per second his feeling was that audiences had gotten used to the look of standard film people were subliminally aware of the 24 frame per second flicker by projecting the film at twice the standard rate the flicker was harder to perceive and the film would be given that much more immediacy however it was impossible to convince the theater owners to install the special projectors to show the recorded experience sequences the movie was released as a conventional film fortunately the story stood up well on its own partly correct showscan runs at 60fps when he was doing test work for 2001 i believe it was on the spacewalk footage but its been years since i read up on the process and things have blurred for me he accidentally ran a sequence at 60fps and the uniform reaction in the booth was shock that hed gotten a 3d effect with a conventional camera he did dream up brainstorm to use the process but the studio hed been working with didnt want to install the only projector on the market that would run 60fps for an extended period without breaking for just one film and he ended up taking the story idea with him to mgm as i remember it he had to do a sizable payout to get it from his previous studio even then mgm wouldnt go for it compare and contrast with the ua chain which installed a highly sophisticated 3d system in a number of their theaters including seattle and ended up offering a couple of million dollars as a bounty to get someone anyone to shoot a feature using it there were several showscan shorts shot the one at expo 86 the one on magic tricks starring christopher lee and it looked like hed finally get them in widespread distribution when he signed a deal with a major restaurant chain to add a showscan theater to each of their restaurants but the chain was chuck e cheese and the deal was about two months before they imploded of all the reviews i read about the process the one that stuck with me was the one in cinefantastique that said makeup technology was going to have to improve greatly if the process was going to catch on you could apparently see every pore on christopher lees face

4325874 i dont know how people are going to respond to it
4325875 it doesnt have the humor or even the humanity that the original had
4325876 i know you cant just remake the original just like it was because today it would be really corny

4325903 of course i mean for a lot of americans including the family that i grew up with i mean its fundamental to how you judge people and human character whether you keep your word whether you keep what is your ultimate word which is that you love your spouse and youll stay with them i think the most important qualities in a president in todays world are trustworthiness sincerity honesty strength of leadership and and certainly that goes to a part of that
4325904 chief and christmas are hiking in virginia started last tuesday i think i lose count of the starts and stops he wanted me to let you know this since he says he is conserving his phone charge to talk to me good to know he understands his priorities they started at rock fish gap and are on the way to montebello

4325906 tradition tells us that the best of the gentiles deserve death
4325907 brought charges against the talmud saying that it was filled with abuse against the founder of the christian religion donin demonstrated that it was the talmud which prevented the jews from accepting christianity and that without it they would certainly have abandoned their state of unbelief he stated that the talmudical writing taught it was a meritorious action to kill the best man among the christians that it was lawful to deceive a christian without any scruple
4325908 the obligations and rules of the rite for the jewish masses are contained in the talmud and schulchan aruk but the esoteric teachings for the higher initiates are to be found in the cabala
4325909 the chaldean science acquired by many of the jewish priests during the captivity of babylon gave birth to the sect of the pharisees whose name appears in the holy scriptures and in the writings of the jewish historians after the captivity 606 b
4325910 ye serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of hell
4325911 ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it
4325912 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness
4325913 this group of intellectual pantheists was soon to acquire a directing influence over the jewish nation
4325914 to communicate anything to a goy about our religious relations would be equal to the killing of all the jews for if the goys knew what we teach about them they would kill us openly
4325915 by what miracle did whole provinces of france become heavily mortgaged to the jews when there are only sixty thousand of them in the country
4325916 until you actually get the bulldozers on the ground in 2010 i think thats going to be out there
4325917 i think theres going to be some cynicism i think theres going to be some doubts
4325918 so we do have a lot of education to do with the general public
4325919 you dont set aside 100 million if youre not serious about getting on with the project
4325920 while we believe that potential accc issues can be resolved they may come at a price to bg and possibly to qgc if bg has to exit its 20 per cent stake in qgcs tenements
4325921 all this spells delay or an adverse finding by the accc with bg forced to go back to the accc with its solution which we do not believe is the best outcome for bg
4325922 it will be a bit different playing out there as a dad
4325923 but i had a good sleep last night and i am going to have a rest this afternoon so i will be more than ready to play against the dragons
4325924 recruiting and retaining a stable and skilled work force is becoming increasingly difficult
4325925 the survey makes it clear housing is a key factor in stabilizing and sustaining that work force
4325926 farmworker housing has been such a huge issue for so long
4325927 i just feel its important that something better is developed period
4325928 the need its huge as far as quantifying the need its like trying to hit a moving target
4325929 both the state and the industry are working together to try to meet the need
4325930 the truth is that the workers are supporting our economy and just like everybody else they deserve a place to sleep at night
4325931 give some breaks to farmers to house these folks onsite
4325932 our priority in the farm bureau is the migrant worker
4325933 i think it would move to the area of jeopardizing health and safety
4325934 for a low price tweetsms can send you individual hourly or daily updates from all of your friends
4325935 also plan to deploy an ad based service for free updates
4325936 if i may be so bold there was another president
4325937 at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4325938 we talk about how theres only one president at a time so the idea that you would send your own emissaries and really interfere with the process is remarkable
4325939 its very risky and can send mixed messages to foreign governments they accused obama of being presumptuous but he didnt do anything close to this
4325940 part of a strategic energy corridor affecting individual lives far beyond
4325941 these are the kinds of things that the president should have been saying from the beginning
4325942 we want to avoid any armed conflict and we will not have armed conflict
4325943 thats not the solution to this problem but we have to stand up for freedom and democracy as we did in the darkest days
4325944 you know i think he spends less time on his presidential campaign these days and lots of time on georgia
4325945 and i really appreciate that because senator mccain has been fighting for freedom of georgia for many many years
4325946 it will be a bit different playing out there as a dad
4325947 but i had a good sleep last night and i am going to have a rest this afternoon so i will be more than ready to play against the dragons
4325948 while we believe that potential accc issues can be resolved they may come at a price to bg and possibly to qgc if bg has to exit its 20 per cent stake in qgcs tenements
4325949 all this spells delay or an adverse finding by the accc with bg forced to go back to the accc with its solution which we do not believe is the best outcome for bg
4325950 until you actually get the bulldozers on the ground in 2010 i think thats going to be out there

4325960 he was going to change his mind because he said i taught him how to love
4325961 hes killed way a lot more people that you dont even know about he killed dylan
4325962 dear dad i have very good news and it is we are coming home soon it might be a week or 2 so we will be back
4325963 we might see you again and we might not if we decide to go with him we will go see eminem and get 1 000 000 and we already have 1 000 000 but we figured the 1 000 000 was fake
4325964 dear dad this is dylan we are still alive we are ok and we know what happened to mom mark and slade and im sorry you had to loose sic a son and an exwife and im sorry we had to be taken away from you and i miss you

4325966 there were stormy moments for her a lot of tears and a lot of struggle
4325967 i have this recollection of somebody asking me for lawyers in new york and i remember naming three or four and he must have been one of them
4325968 it was either her who called or somebody on her behalf
4325969 i remember getting a call from pam and her telling me that she was representing him
4325970 i may have sent him over there but on the other hand i may not have i dont have an accurate recollection
4325971 i have a brief recollection of giving someone some cash my assumption is i loaned some small amount of money to the both of them
4325972 ms hunter called me i represent her and only her as i would any client
4325973 whether a member of the public attends a hearing and provides oral comments or submits a letter in writing about a finalist for judicial office the public should be able to ascertain who is having input into the selection of judges in rhode island
4325974 following the second judicial scandal in a decade in which the chief justice of the rhode island supreme court was forced to resign under a cloud of pending impeachment rhode island voters approved the 1994 constitutional amendment establishing judicial merit selection by an overwhelming 70 percent
4325975 the central principle behind merit selection is that an independent nonpartisan jnc would provide a list of 3 to 5 highly qualified candidates for each judicial vacancy based on merit and through a public process
4325976 makes available to the public all documents papers letters etc in connection with the transaction of official business by any agency
4325977 provides that certain information shall not be deemed public records including information in personnel files maintained to hire evaluate promote or discipline any employee of a public body
4325978 while there is no requirement that applicants submit letters of recommendation it has been the custom and practice for applicants to request people to write on their behalf
4325979 the commission believes that the application and the accompanying letters are documents of a nature exempted under the provisions of the access to public records act in that they are part of files maintained as part of the process of hiring judges
4325980 we disagree with the reasoning that simply because the letters are kept in the same file with the application that they should be exempt from disclosure
4325981 what is the point of watering down the education requirements and the experience standards it looks like someone has an agenda to hand out town jobs to cronies who dont meet the current qualifications
4325982 there doesnt seem to be a compelling need to add more seats you are looking at more cost to the town we are trying to cut money
4325983 i think its an affront to voters to propose taking away their right to fill school committee vacancies in a special election and give it to the powers that be on the council
4325984 would give people in the town three people to call instead of just one
4325985 gives us more latitude in choosing someone with that experience without the masters degree
4325986 some good candidates that the town council couldnt consider because of the masters degree requirement
4325987 these are former gang members who have turned their lives around and are on the street working with youths to curb violence
4325988 they just want be more visible to show that they are still around and will keep doing what they doing and encourage other people to choose peace
4325989 decisions and policies enacted by governor carcieri that have hurt the immigrant and latino community the most recent being the raids in the rhode island state courthouses
4325990 to establish this public policy the governor used incorrect data and hes not willing to retract the order or at least take one step back and say lets get the right data
4325991 he didnt even listen to us he didnt even alert us to the fact that he was having his executive order essentially we werent good enough to be his advisers we were just a showcase
4325992 have their reasons for resigning and we respect those reasons we feel our community needs a lot of representation at this time and we can work better within the system
4325993 have had this in mind for quite some time and apparently the feelings have reached quite a momentum i can only respect their decision and wish them well and encourage them to be leaders in the community and advocate for those who cannot advocate for themselves
4325994 will continue to exist and we will look for highly committed dedicated members in the community who will want to serve in the future
4325995 appreciates the service of the individuals to the commission their commitment to the promotion of the hispanic and latino community and to the state of rhode island
4325996 the hispanic community is an important part of the fabric of the rhode island community and they will continue to have a voice in the carcieri administration
4325997 i am not jose mourinho so why compare me with him
4325998 mourinho says i will win 10 championships but i am more modest than that
4325999 if i fail to offer mental training i cant see how im helping the players
4326000 im not saying necessarily that theyre old because with modern day training you should be playing in your thirties
4326001 what i am saying is that i dont see outstanding progress in a team thats in their thirties
4326002 i dont need to win to be sure of what im doing
4326003 ranieri hes actually correct i am very demanding with myself and i need to win to be sure of things
4326004 he on the other hand has the mentality of one who does not need to win at almost 70 years of age he is too old to change his mentality
4326005 i believe in this time and place its electronic bingo halls not apropriate for the town of pearl river
4326006 i think a slot machine with the word bingo on top of it is still a slot machine

4326012 my girl won the gold medal it was worth suffering the pain alone for all that time
4326013 i just wanted her to concentrate 100 percent on her shooting i know how hard she has trained for the olympics over the past four years
4326014 it was really hard for me to admit that i had lied to her
4326015 once when she was in a lot of pain after a chemotherapy session zhang begged me to call chen and tell her everything
4326016 but then she calmed down and told me not to she never wanted to upset her daughter
4326017 many who come across the border are workers but among them are people coming to kill you and me and your children
4326018 between the years 1994 and 2002 about 1 3 million mexican farmers or farm laborers had been displaced by a trade deficit that had been brought about most significantly by nafta
4326019 where do these people go well they might try to go to mexican cities but the promise of nafta to greatly increase industrialization in mexico never materialized to the extent it materialized anywhere it was in the border regions but it didnt materialize sufficiently and at the same time of course many of these maquiladoras the factories are moving to china so they end up coming to places like new york city oakland california or rural areas of wisconsin
4326020 the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
4326021 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
4326022 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
4326023 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
4326024 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated
4326025 well id like to thank the chef boyardee parenting team and the keebler elves pit crew for a daring performance today here at the pine sol cup elm street nationals it was a team effort chuck we were struggling in the early stages of the race today what with two tantrums four naughty words and a technical its a credit to this winning team that we were able to strap junior to the chair

4326038 canadians are in there fighting the past four years canadians have realized theyre better and theyre just fighting for it we know were as good as the rest of the world
4326039 i think a lot more could be done a lot more should be done
4326040 but its pretty rich coming from the opposition given they were in government for 11 years and did nothing
4326041 i think what we need to do is focus on working with indigenous artists making sure that they work through art centres where possible
4326042 until you actually get the bulldozers on the ground in 2010 i think thats going to be out there
4326043 i think theres going to be some cynicism i think theres going to be some doubts
4326044 so we do have a lot of education to do with the general public
4326045 you dont set aside 100 million if youre not serious about getting on with the project
4326046 because of the nature of the business theres a lot of travel involved odd hours thereve been times we all live under the same roof but we havent seen each other for days on end
4326047 its wonderful to get an opportunity to spend six weeks on the road with the family i dont think weve spent this amount of time and this quality of time for over 10 years together
4326048 when we see the live audience hear their roar hear their appreciation that is the incentive
4326049 every time we keep feeling like oh my god last nights show was fabulous it has been very very overwhelming

4326053 a debate today between astronomer neil degrasse tyson and planetary scientist mark sykes moderated by nprs ira flatow addressed the issue of plutos planetary status there was lots of arm waving and finger pointing endless interruptions disagreements on details big and small and battling one liners the two scientists sat at a table with the moderator between them and flatow was often obscured by tyson and sykes getting in each others faces in eye to eye confrontation at one point flatow was hit by tysons ebullient arm motions yes it was heated but it was fun too
4326054 a slave is a man that waits on another to set him free
4326055 itll depend on where she is now how important the case is how much it would cost the taxpayers and whether witnesses are still around
4326056 she was a rather bizarre character and seems to have a strange circumstance now
4326057 there was a strong aroma about her and i told her this needed to be taken care of before i went to court with her
4326058 if these animals could speak to a pollster they would probably tell you that mary jo kilroy isnt qualified to be elected dog catcher
4326059 we believe some animals were left behind that were not fed and some of the puppies got to him not intentionally attacked him but used him as a food source
4326060 the way you perceive cats is the way theyre going to act
4326061 if you treat them like spoiled babies thats what theyll be like but if you have the mentality that they are intelligent and loyal friends thats exactly what they will be
4326062 you only want to work with two cats at a time
4326063 they are so individualized they are just like people that way
4326064 some cats like wet treats some like hard you need to find out what your cat will respond to the best
4326065 then you can start to deter them from where you dont want them to scratch
4326066 i do not recommend throwing a can full of coins or using a water spray bottle because while people think their cat is not going to relate it to them doing it cats are too smart for that
4326067 wash the litterbox often at least once a week in soap and water
4326068 if its dirty your cats not going to want to use it
4326069 shes unique shes afflicted with crippling depression the elephant sanctuary is the right choice
4326070 why would we want her last years to be in a drive through zoo in mexico when she could have 300 acres in the lush tennessee countryside
4326071 if we stripped everything away and say what is in the best interest of jenny the sanctuary would win hands down
4326072 but then you have to add in all the politics
4326073 i like keeping these elephants within the aza where they meet our standards
4326074 space is just a catchphrase its what you do with that space
4326075 you just never know whats going to happen to them down in mexico
4326076 they were old and we were hearing that they dont want kennels anymore
4326077 the best thing to do was get rid of them
4326078 that someone would shoot 70 dogs rather than spend money to do a vet check is extremely problematic
4326079 if the definition of a puppy mill is putting profits over care of the dogs this is a stark example of doing that
4326080 there are others ways to take care of the situation like in a court
4326081 he could have treated the dogs with medication for 40 or 50
4326082 every humane society in the state would have taken those dogs
4326083 i stand firmly with the members of the senate republican caucus who today announced that they will not support mark olson for the open senate seat of betsy wergin
4326084 the senate republican caucus has made the appropriate decision in rejecting the candidacy of mark olson i understand there are other candidates who may remain eligible to run in the september primary and i would hope that they continue their efforts to become our partys standard bearer
4326085 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4326086 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4326087 the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4326088 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4326089 residual security arrangements that the russians would be able to maintain
4326090 critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas

4326112 no est ni se la espera no preside no asume responsabilidades no decide pasa la pelota a otros concejales y ella est en otros temas ella es la alcaldesa pero para qu es una alcaldesa virtual
4326113 given the tremendous physical and psychological benefits of exercise everyone should be doing it no matter what their age
4326114 youve got a lot of sins to atone for when you hit middle age
4326115 the biggest problem for older guys who exercise is that they dont realize that their bodies have changed
4326116 if youre planning on starting a new activity gradually increase your exercise a month beforehand
4326117 a lot of middle aged men want to compete with the guy next to them on a fitness machine at the gym or to engage in contests to see who can lift the most but pushing yourself too hard for no good reason is silly and dangerous
4326118 the whole notion of no pain no gain has to be thrown out
4326119 pain especially in older men is an important sign that something is wrong
4326120 a lot of guys dont want to acknowledge that theyve been hurt to their buddies
4326121 theres a lot of emphasis on playing through pain but that just isnt a good idea because you run the risk of developing a chronic injury
4326122 anyone playing a contact sport including basketball has to remember that hes putting himself at an increased risk of injury
4326123 because you cant control what other people are doing you cant prevent the risk of getting elbowed or knocked over
4326124 frankly i think that everyone no matter what the age should talk to their doctors before beginning a new exercise program
4326125 the good thing about overuse injuries is that we can really treat them effectively
4326126 we can make sure that old injuries are properly rehabilitated teach someone how to gradually work back into a sport and cross train and work on his muscle strength and flexibility
4326127 in fact the basic recommendations concerning exercise are no different for older adults than they are for younger adults
4326128 a lot of the weakness that most people attribute to old age is actually from disuse
4326129 it can mean the difference between being bedridden and being able to move around freely
4326130 rake leaves or go dancing dont let age prevent you from doing the normal activities you used to do
4326131 s lo le interesan los servicios p blicos si es para privatizarlos
4326132 los aparcamientos est n invadidos por la hierba hay ropa de los contenedores a la entrada de la estaci n e incluso veh culos abandonados
4326133 inaceptable y perjudicial que una de las principales entradas de la ciudad se encuentre en una situaci n tan lamentable
4326134 est haciendo campa as para promocionar la venida de turistas y visitantes a la ciudad y mantenga la estaci n en un estado tan deplorable
4326135 debe prestarse con las debidas condiciones de limpieza y accesibilidad
4326136 la comunidad de madrid no puede estar presente como acusaci n popular porque al final pueden acabar siendo acusados
4326137 now faith is the assurance of things hoped for the conviction of things not seen
4326138 it has been a privilege to have spent the past two years at essendon i have made many new friendships and hopefully many of them for life
4326139 i have thoroughly enjoyed my last two seasons upon my arrival i felt instantly accepted by the coaching staff the administrators the players and the supporters
4326140 in particular it has been a privilege to play alongside such champions as dustin fletcher matthew lloyd scott lucas scott camporeale and james hird as well as many other fine young players at the club
4326141 i felt that the club had been good enough to give me a two year contract to begin with i was going to fulfil that contract
4326142 i also felt that i am here to develop some of the younger players and if i had left straight away i wouldnt have done that i hope that by the time i do leave here i will have left the club in a better state than when i got here
4326143 i have seen paddy ryder and tayte pears and danny chartres develop so i think my work is done here
4326144 i have played for 13 years and have had a pretty good run i think if you had of told me in december of 1995 at collingwood that i would play 13 years had some success and played over 250 games i would have taken that
4326145 for me the decision was quite an easy one in the end because the warning signs were there i was getting to friday morning pretty sore and tired from the previous week and waking up on saturday morning hoping that i would be right for the weekends game
4326146 i think once you start doing that it is out of your control and you have to start taking a serious look at your future i should also say i have also received fantastic support from the trainers and medical staff at this club
4326147 the way that football has evolved just doesnt suit my frame and body type anymore it is more of a young running mans type of game
4326148 when i started i was 68kg and now im 100kg i encourage the younger guys to be better runners than to be heavier
4326149 in light of my experience at the club over the past two years i believe the club and its supporters are going to have many successful years ahead of them
4326150 i was getting a little bit of deja vu when i walked in
4326151 i think it was harder the first time to be honest i was 29 at that point and was battling each week to play
4326152 in terms of what i am going to be doing next year it is widely known that there were many factors prompting my retirement in 2006 my charity in new guinea as well as some business interests
4326153 as you know i am from papua new guinea and next year will give me the opportunity to pursue that in more of a full time role
4326154 in 2002 i returned to new guinea after many years and i saw the trouble the country had so i wanted to help in some ways
4326155 with my football career drawing to a close i wanted to spend some time up there with the charity and also my business interests and hopefully i can increase the standards of education sport and health in the country
4326156 we feel mal has made a great contribution to the football club not only through playing good football but he has also allowed dustin fletcher great flexibility to play good football club while aiding in the development of patrick ryder a young player
4326157 electro glass is highly respected company known for its honesty
4326158 if they truly believed the shipments were in violation of the law
4326159 it will be genuinely unfortunate if they are forced to close their doors
4326160 that products for military use arent being sold to countries that might have an improper and criminal use for the product
4326161 because companies that violate federal law are the type of company that the government does not want to continue in that particular business
4326162 in 2004 they were charged with a criminal offense because they knowingly willfully violated the federal statute
4326163 kau harus menutupinya nak karena kebenaran menyakitkan sebagian orang tutupilah dengan kebohongan yang menyenangkan mereka

4326170 im not sure why they made it a female voice
4326171 im guessing its because men are used to women nagging at them
4326172 a place that may ultimately reveal just exactly what kind of environment habitable or not we have within this tortured little moon
4326173 knowing exactly where to point at just the right time was critical to this event
4326174 the challenge is equivalent to trying to capture a sharp unsmeared picture of a distant roadside billboard with a telephoto lens out the window of a speeding car
4326175 enceladus was streaking across the sky so quickly that the spacecraft had no hope of tracking any feature on its surface our best option was to point the spacecraft far ahead of enceladus spin the spacecraft and camera as fast as possible in the direction of enceladus predicted path and let enceladus overtake us at a time when we could match its motion across the sky snapping images along the way
4326176 there appears to have been extensive fallout of icy particles to the ground along some of the fractures even in areas that lie between two jet source locations though any immediate effects of presently active jets are subtle
4326177 for the first time we are beginning to understand how freshly erupted surface deposits differ from older deposits

4326217 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4326220 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4326221 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4326222 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4326244 and what we want people to realize is that the r word or retard is really a hateful term to this population theyve been taunted in schoolyards they get taunted when they go out in the community its very hurtful its not just a word you can casually throw about
4326245 we have got to fight it with everything weve got
4326246 put simply we cannot let the liberals take this country back to the tax and spend policies of the past
4326247 it will drive up the price of everything transportation groceries electricity heating even propane for our bbqs
4326248 theres a reason it didnt mention the carbon tax policy

4326256 it atmosphere was a little different because it is kind of a home game for us but is so close to pittsburgh that a lot of pittsburgh fans drove to the game
4326257 i think its going to do well for the nfl
4326258 we have to get the crowd a little bit more into it and it happens with time
4326259 when the regular season comes its going to be different because the first team will be out there for the whole game

4326266 asphalt has a lot of advantages as a solar collector
4326267 for one blacktop stays hot and could continue to generate energy after the sun goes down unlike traditional solar electric cells in addition there is already a massive acreage of installed roads and parking lots that could be retrofitted for energy generation so there is no need to find additional land for solar farms roads and lots are typically resurfaced every 10 to 12 years and the retrofit could be built into that cycle extracting heat from asphalt could cool it reducing the urban heat island effect finally unlike roof top solar arrays which some find unattractive the solar collectors in roads and parking lots would be invisible

4326276 because of the cuny dominican studies institute and our location in upper manhattan ccny has forged strong bonds with the dominican republic and new yorks dominican communities
4326277 we are proud to host this groundbreaking exhibition and make it accessible to the entire community by displaying it in the beautifully refurbished public space along amsterdam avenue
4326278 we believe that in order to understand who dominicans truly are you have to examine the lives of those from the island as well as the enormous population that now lives abroad
4326279 mercasid is very proud of this project and is excited to share this photo exhibition with such a respected institution as city college cuny and the dedicated members of the cuny dominican studies institute
4326280 the connections between dominicans abroad and dominicans in the country of origin are being finally recognized more and more
4326281 we see this effort by a large island based company like mercasid as another indication of that recognition
4326282 in order to understand who dominicans are and what they are capable of you definitely need to widen the scope and include both those in the island and the enormous population that now lives abroad the largest one residing here in the united states
4326283 we are very excited to participate in mujer showcasing dominican women
4326284 the city college libraries are a cornerstone of the upper manhattan community and collaborating on this project literally in our front yard on amsterdam avenue is opening our library doors to the community to show the achievements of the women of a great people
4326285 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
4326286 university teachers should simply accept as variant spelling those words our students most commonly misspell
4326287 there are enormous advantages in having a coherent system of spelling
4326288 it makes it easier to communicate maybe during a learning phase there is some scope for error but i would hope that by the time people get to university they have learnt to spell
4326289 as we have seen the purpose of the book of acts is to minimize the conflict between paul and the leaders of the jerusalem church james and peter
4326290 it is a very long intense process that is far from over
4326291 how many electricians does it take to get the bat off the ceiling outside medical
4326292 we were still labouring under the legacy of the 1960s
4326293 that golden age still lingers and its hovering over student newspapers to this day it didnt help that it was the papers 125th anniversary so there was an expectation that we would be looking back at what the previous generations had achieved
4326294 meanwhile i was trying to steer it a little more away from its own ideological stance and that meant trying to get as many different voices in the paper as possible but i was mostly interested in contributors whod make people want to read it
4326295 i try not to be a snob about these things
4326296 people have come to think progressive leaning means you arent interested in business and thats simply not true leftist politics were always rooted in economic issues labour exploitation and a critique of where the money goes whos getting it and why
4326297 somewhere down the line these topics were overtaken by identity politics political correctness and lots of whining you end up with protest for its own sake which is hard to intellectually take and it wouldnt help the magazine to be presented as the work of some bomb throwing anarchists instead we can ask about whats going on here and seriously analyze the received wisdom about it

4326312 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4326313 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4326314 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4326315 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4326316 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4326321 barangsiapa membaca 1 huruf daripada al quran maka dia mendapat 1 kebaikan dan kebaikan itu pula diganda menjadi 10
4326322 bacalah olehmu semua akan al quran itu sebab al quran itu akan datang pada hari kiamat sebagai suatu yang dapat memberikan syafaat yakni pertolongan kepada orang yang mempunyainya
4326323 we recognize that in america this is going after somebody who is more comfortable with technology
4326324 the truth is that in other countries its becoming a part of their culture the trend is coming and as a fashion company its very important to identify trends and get ahead of them
4326325 this election is like death for life on this planet as we know it today
4326326 neptune violated 14 league of planets resolutions the empire spent years trying to get the other members of the league to take action to enforce those resolutions
4326327 earth adopted a policy of pre emptive action against planets that sponsor terrorism harbor terrorism or threaten other planets all of this led to earths invasion of neptune even after all of this the empire was ill prepared for the additional war and weve paid for it ever since
4326328 saturn on the other hand has been secretly planning its invasion for years saturns sorties have been swift efficient and effective without outside interference the war will be over in weeks if not days
4326329 but other than that yes the two invasions are exactly the same
4326330 were mostly just jealous i guess you could say that saturn got to it before we did
4326331 the territories of xanadu and shangri la declared their independence titan has no moral right to hold them hostage or enforce its rule by force
4326332 take your time i want you to be 100 percent if youre able to come back and play again
4326333 in the past few months and particularly over the summer we have seen increasing signs that this parliament is really not working very well any more it is becoming increasingly dysfunctional
4326334 quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4326335 governing is more than not just being defeated in the house its also being able to pass legislation
4326336 this is the prime minister who made a virtue of passing fixed election date legislation and now hes threatening to cross sussex drive and go see his neighbour the governor general and ask for an election because hes fabricating a crisis where none exists
4326337 taking on the system rules for radical change in a digital era
4326338 trinidad and tobago and three other caribbean states grenada st vincent and the grenadines and st lucia last night signed an agreement to achieve economic integration by 2011 and political integration by two years later
4326339 no diet will remove all the fat from your body because the brain is entirely fat without a brain you might look good but all you could do is run for public office
4326340 the devil has put a penalty on all things we enjoy in life either we suffer in health or we suffer in soul or we get fat
4326341 a conservative is a man who is too cowardly to fight and too fat to run
4326342 dont dig your grave with your own knife and fork
4326343 more die in the united states of too much food than of too little
4326344 ive decided that perhaps im bulimic and just keep forgetting to purge
4326345 in the middle ages they had guillotines stretch racks whips and cahins nowadays we have a much more effective torture device called the bathroom scale
4326346 its okay to be fat so youre fat just be fat and shut up about it
4326347 i feel about airplanes the way i feel about diets it seems to me that they are wonderful things for other people to go on
4326348 the one way to get thin is to re establish a purpose in life
4326349 avoid any diet that discourages the use of hot fudge
4326350 the biggest seller is cookbooks and the second is diet books how not to eat what youve just learned how to cook
4326351 gluttony is an emotional escape a sign something is eating us
4326352 if i had been around when rubens was painting i would have been revered as a fabulous model kate moss well she would have been the paintbrush
4326353 food is like sex when you abstain even the worst stuff begins to look good
4326354 the second day of a diet is always easier than the first by the second day youre off it
4326355 govern well thy appetite lest sin surprise thee and her black attendant death
4326356 people say that losing weight is no walk in the park when i hear that i think yeah thats the problem
4326357 as for food half of my friends have dug their graves with their teeth
4326358 to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing
4326359 i am not a glutton i am an explorer of food
4326360 i think the majority of people who cross over and vote in another partys primary do so because they want to have a say in who represents them and that is a good thing
4326361 so while a closed primary system has its merits there are a lot of ballot access problems that would need to be ironed out before i could support such a move in tennessee
4326362 this is not about protecting the sanctity of the process this is about a guy who doesnt want to go down in history as the first incumbent republican to fumble a 1st district election since 1932
4326363 the only way to enforce this notion is to close the primary something that has been advocated in this space on numerous occasions because there is no way to determine voter intent where party loyalty is concerned without party registration and closed primaries
4326364 we interviewed congressman davis on our radio program on election day and at that time he was very concerned about the democrats being so open in their support and electioneering for roe
4326365 huge numbers of democrats in the first district just over 6 000 took part in the democrat primary compared to a low turnout of some 50 000 for the republican primary
4326366 the laws describe an awful lot of steps to be taken at the polling place it presents issues as to the feasibility of challenging each of those rascaly democrats ballots as well as a problem of timing namely that the law describes various steps to be taken in the event a challenge is filed before the vote happens at the polling place
4326367 while rep david davis is getting a lot of ink for his increasingly likely intention to challenge his election result tim barnes wants us to know that he too believes interlopers affected the outcome of his race against rosalind kurita
4326368 way too much time on your hands there buddy analyzing pornography great blog though
4326369 of all the bloggers out there you crack me up i spent the entire rest of my work day just enjoying your site
4326370 i just discovered your blog today what a rude awakening that was sincerely a dyed in the wool breeder guy who still thinks your blog is funny
4326371 you seem to like uncut which is fine unless its the kind where the skin hangs way down over the head ewwww
4326372 i thought immediately that the contents which appeared to recognize and concretize the bangsamoros right to self determination and ancestral domain were too good and too generous to be true
4326373 the moa was so contrary to the greedy and brutal character of the grp government of the republic of the philippines whose presumptions and actuations i have long known in the course of revolutionary struggle and the grp ndfp peace negotiations
4326374 the pretense at generosity is full of malice it is calculated to outwit and outflank the milf and the bangsamoro and to facilitate frontal military attacks against them they are being left no choice but to wage revolutionary struggle in order to advance their cause of national self determination there is a heightened need for the unity cooperation of the milf and the ndfp in their distinct and common concerns and causes against the same adversaries
4326375 it was almost predictable that the signing of the moa would be aborted the public release of the draft only a few days before the date of signing was clearly meant to stir up a controversy big enough to cause the abortion
4326376 it is obvious that the us has been out to sidle up to and ingratiate itself with the milf and the bangsamoro in order to further strengthen its position in exploiting the human and natural resources of the bangsamoro and deploying us military forces in mindanao
4326377 unilaterally or in cahoots with the grp the us can use the high expectations raised by the moa among the milf and bangsamoros to justify us military presence and advance us hegemony in mindanao
4326378 prolong grp milf informal talks and ceasefire and to deploy larger us and philippine military forces against the milf and the bangsamoro
4326379 there is a strong us dollar theme across markets building momentum from the day before
4326380 i believe this is the beginning of a us dollar correction of the major move lower so the next three to six months is bullish for the dollar
4326381 for asia it will ebb and flow between different currencies those ahead of the curve on inflation will perform better in the long term those behind and with deficits will suffer
4326382 the weakness in the singapore dollar is in tandem with the big us dollar move with lots of buying interest from the opening levels this morning
4326383 for fifty bucks id put my face in their soup and blow
4326384 they had flowers everywhere on every corner for miles and miles
4326385 i could tell they were getting ready for the olympics
4326386 my hope for her is that she will become the best that she can be
4326387 to be successful to the point where we can have a good feeling that we made a difference in her life after adopting her and that she have a family some day that we can carry on
4326388 it had just started raining at the time she took her eyes off the road she may have been trying to turn on her windshield wipers and drifted over
4326389 it didnt appear to be any alcohol or drugs just appeared to be a case of a careless driver
4326390 as a police officer this is something i see on a regular basis but when its someone you love and is close to you its an automatic shock and youre going back and forth in your mind trying to figure out how could this possibly happen
4326391 we use a straight edge razor on the neck the hot shaving cream the hot towels
4326392 my mom had cancer throat cancer my friends dad passed away from it
4326393 it will be some of the local girls who live around town who are willing to participate some of the local guys who are bringing their classic cars out its pretty much 72 and back

4326399 we are in a profession that keeps score and no score is more important than our graduation success rate
4326400 the university of miami is synonymous with champions and the young people in our program today are focused on becoming champions both in the classroom and in competition i commend the young people currently in our program today and those in the past for their dedication and commitment to academic excellence
4326401 mommy i am your son and you are my mommy so you have to listen to me
4326402 those arent cigarettes those are werthers what am i 90
4326403 her tits had clocks melting off of them and were covered in ants
4326404 ah tampaknya makan rujak buah akan segera mengembalikan kesegaran tubuhku
4326405 saya jualan rujak buah di jakarta sudah lumayan lama mas kira kira sudah lima tahun lebih biasanya saya mangkal di belakang depdagri
4326406 saya jualan di depan istana kalau ada demo saja soalnya saya tahu orang orang yang demo pasti kepanasan dan butuh yang segar segara kaya rujak buah ini
4326407 setelah kenaikan bbm orang orang yang demo di depan istana semakin banyak saya pikir ini kesempatan saya untuk segera meraup untung alias menghabiskan jualan saya
4326408 meskipun berjualan rujak buah di arena demo lebih cepat habis dan menguntungkan saya rasa tetap lebih enak kalau bbm tidak naik karena dengan naiknya bbm harga harga buah semakin mahal dan makan diwarung juga mahal
4326409 kalau tidak ada teman yang mengajak ke jakarta saya mana berani ke jakarta tapi selain itu saya memang sedang didesak kebutuhan ekonomi
4326410 kontrakan di jakarta harganya mahal mas makanya bisa tinggal di rumah bedeng saja bagi saya sudah cukup
4326411 kalau mengontrak rumah atau kamar yang permanem di jakarta harganya mahal tidak sesuai dengan pendapatan saya apalagi saya harus menghidupi istri dan anak anak saya yang tinggal di kampung
4326412 setiap kali berjualan keuntungan yang saya dapat hanya rp 40 000 50 000 tapi kalau lagi ramai bisa dapat rp 100 000 tapi itu jarang sekali
4326413 untuk buat atau beli gerobaknya saja menghabiskan rp 250 000 sisanya saya belikan keperluan lainnya dan buah buahan
4326414 sudah lima tahun saya berjualan tapi masih belum ada peningkatan atau penambahan penjualan apalagi peningkatan modal wong bisa memutar modal awal agar tidak sampai rugi sudah bagus
4326415 saya maupun teman teman saya seprofesi tidak tahun apa itu kur setahu saya kalau pinjam di bank pasti urusannya ribet dan harus menyertakan jaminan
4326416 kalau memang pemerintah berpihak kepada rakyat kecil kenapa pemerintah harus menaikkan bbm dan kenapa program program yang memang diperuntukkan buat rakyat kecil banyak yang tidak sampai kepada rakyat kecil
4326417 georgia bigfoot amp squo or high technology results they news catskill in leader so
4326418 i need regular sex and someone to listen to my problems at all hours of the night and occasionally bail me out of jail so youll do until someone better comes along
4326419 larry this is an excellent report that you wrote im putting you on the top of the list for the next promotion
4326420 makanya menurut saya untuk mencapai kesejahteraan lebih cepat bekerja di jakarta
4326421 dengan alasan pendapatan di jakarta lebih besar saya nekad memberanikan diri hijrah ke jakarta untuk bekerja menjadi di salah satu pabrik di daerah di jakarta timur dan menurut saya ketika bekerja menjadi buruh itulah saya merasa kehidupan saya jauh lebih baik dari sekarang karena gaji pokok saya sudah mencapai rp 1 juta
4326422 alasan alasan seperti itu saya kira banyak yang dipakai oleh orang orang yang mengadu nasib di jakarta
4326423 saat ini jakarta masih menjadi tempat impian untuk meraih kesuksesan karena di jakarta pusat pusat perdagangan dan indsutri tumbuh pesat sedangkan di daerah perkembangan industrinya sangat lamban sekali
4326424 setelah restoran tempat saya bekerja kena gusur selama beberapa bulan saya menganggur dan akhirnya saya memutuskan untuk berjualan siomay walaupun keuntungannya hanya cukup buat saya makan sendiri di sini
4326425 berjualan siomay keliling cuma mengisi waktu luang sekaligus untuk mempertahankan hidup di jakarta saya masih punya harapan untuk bisa membangun kembali rstoran padang bersama teman teman saya
4326426 300 biji siomay tiap hari saya jual namun jarang habis semunya
4326427 dengan begitu walaupun keuntungan yang saya dapat cuma 20 ribu sehari bagi saya itu lumayan buat bertahan hidup
4326428 saya kalau menghadapi pembeli sepertinya saya tidak ada harganya saya merasa saya orang yang paling kecil dan hina didunia ini
4326429 mimpi untuk meraih kesejahteraanlah yang sampai saat ini membuat saya bertahan dan kuat menjalani hidup di jakarta meskipun hidup di jakarta teramat susah dan berat
4326430 mungkin kalau saya hanya membawa diri tidak membawa keranjang pikulan tidaklah terlalu berat meskipun di kereta krl ekonomi jurusan bogor jakarta sangat padat dan pengap
4326431 apalagi kalau kereta yang saya tumpangi ada gangguan ditengah jalan panasnya minta ampun
4326432 meskipun naik kerata krl ekonomi jurusan bogor jakarta pengap panas dan berdesak desakan serta sangat melelahkan tapi semua itu tidak terasa karena berangkatnya bersama sama teman
4326433 begitulah suka duka naik angkutan rakyat kecil red krl ekonomi selain murah kadang tidak manusiawi
4326434 kue yang saya jual cuma kue lepat kacang rebus pisang rebus tape ketan uli opak dan telur asin itu semua jajanan orang kampung yang saat ini sudah langka
4326435 jadi saya ini adalah orang kampung yang berjualan kue kampung buat orang orang kampung
4326436 semua kue kue yang saya jual harganya cuma rp 1 000 dan harga ini adalah harga yang pas buat orang orang kampung
4326437 dengan menjual kue kue yang direbus selain mengirit biaya juga jauh lebih sehat dan alami
4326438 nah kalau tape ketan dan telur asin biasanya agak lama karena butuh proses kalau telur asin cukup sehari semalam untuk membuatnya asin kalau tape agak lama yaitu 3 hari untuk proses jadi tapenya
4326439 padahal pada jaman dulu kue kue seperti itu menjadi makanan setiap hari orang orang betawi dan orang orang cina setiap tempat nongkrong atau ngopi kue kue ini selalu tersedia
4326440 bayangkan hanya untuk melukis kain batik dengan ukuran panjang 2 meter dan lebar 1 5 meter dibutuhkan waktu selama 3 bulan itu disebabkan karena kerumitan motif yang dimilikinya dan hasilnyapun harus benar benar mengandung nilai seni yang tinggi
4326441 umumnya motif batik jogja merupakan warisan leluhur terutama diambil dari warisan keraton jogja
4326442 kebetulan kedua orang tua saya adalah pengrajin batik di pekalongan jadi mungkin kemapuan membatik saya adalah keturunan dari orang tua
4326443 kalau dihitung hitung saya sudah membatik hampir 55 tahun dan selama 55 tahun itu sudah banyak batik yang sudah saya buat dan sudah banyak pula suka dan duka yang saya alami dalam melakoni usaha kerajinan batik trutama batik tulis jogja
4326444 saya bertekad terus untuk tetap menjadi pengrajin batik tulis karena batik tulis adalah warisan leluhur yang harus tetap saya jaga
4326445 tapi saya khawatir terhadap keberlangsungan batik tulis jogja karena anak anak muda sekarang jarang yang berminat terhadap kerajinan batik tulis anak anak sekarang lebih suka pada hal hal yang berbau produk barat daripada produk asli indonesia
4326446 saya cukup senang dengan diadakannya pemeran ini karena dengan begitu kerajinan batik tulis jadi di kenal luas
4326447 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4326448 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
4326449 kate orang orang dulu sejarah munculnya makanan kerok telor pade awalnye sewaktu indonesia masih di jajah ame belande saking susahnya orang orang kemayoran sampe gak punya minyak untuk menggoreng sehingga beras ketan yang ade cuma dicampur sama kelape lalu di goreng tanpa menggunakan minyak goreng kemudian dari itulah muncul apa yang namanye kerak telor
4326450 kerak telor itu identik dengan prj juga sebaliknye makanya kalau di prj tidak ada kerak telor maka penyelenggaraan prj kurang begitu afdhol
4326451 udah gitu tiap kali masuk juga musti bayar tiket rp 16 ribu padahal tahun kemarin gratis
4326452 belum lagi pungutan pungutan liar yang dilakuan pihak trantib ormas ormas semisal fbr maupun preman semakin menambah beban bagi para pedagang kerak telor di arena prj
4326453 apalagi harga tiket masuk arena prj semakin mahal untuk hari biasa aja harga tiketnya rp 15 000 sedangkan hari sabtu dan minggu rp 22 000
4326454 dulu berjualan kerak telor rame karena mungkin di jakarta orang betawinye masih banyak tetapi saat ini orang betawi banyak yang kena gusur dan pindah ke pinggiran seperti bekasi dan tanggerang
4326455 saat berjualan di pasar baru tiap hari saya harus mengelurkan uang rp 15 000 buat uang jago dan uang retribusi belum lagi dikejar kejar petugas dengan alasan tidak tertib
4326456 setiap kali berjualan saya bisa menghabiskan 20 30 butir telor dengan harga kerak telor perbuah rp 7 ribu untuk telor ayam dan rp 8 ribu untuk telor bebek
4326457 di golden truly selain mahal sewa tempatnya saya juga harus bersaing dengan makanan makanan dari luar negeri seperti mc donald
4326458 syukur syukur kerak telor dilindungi sebagai sebuah identitas kota jakarta yang mulai hilang karena tergilas oleh makanan makanan produk luar negeri
4326459 saya mulai berjualan susu kedelai di depan stasiun kranji semenjak tahun 2005 ketika saya baru lulus sd dan waktu itu papa saya belum lama meninggal
4326460 papa dan mama saya adalah keturunan cina yang punya darah sebagai pedagang jadi saya ingin melanjutkan tradisi dagang dikeluarga saya dan berjualan susu kedelai adalah pelajaran dagang saya yang pertama
4326461 enaknya jadi pedagang meskipun hanya menjual susu kedelai adalah tidak ada yang menyuruh atau memerintahkannya layaknya seperti atasaan memerintah bawahan menjadi pedagang selain konsumen yang menjadi raja dirinya juga bisa jadi raja
4326462 saya percaya dan yakin semua orang orang yang kaya sukses red dahulunya adalah pedagang pedagang kecil seperti saya ini kunci kesuksesan mereka adalah ketekunan dan kesabaran begitu yang saya baca dikoran dan saya punya cita cita ingin menjadi pengusaha susu kedelai
4326463 saya cuma mengambil keuntungan 200 perak dari setiap bungkus susu kedelai
4326464 saya hanya menggunakan kedelai air dan gula pasir untuk membuat susu kedelai tidak menambahkan bahan bahan lainnya
4326465 setiap hari saya berangkat pagi pagi sekali ke stasiun untuk berjualan dengan menggunakan sepeda demi menghemat pengeluaran
4326466 kalau saya hanya memikirkan bermain saja saya tidak akan pernah maju dan sukses apalagi kehidupan keluarga saya sedang prihatin
4326467 sewaktu harga kedelai mahal dan kedelai langka dipasaran saya terpaksa menaikan harga susu kedelai yang awalnya cuma rp 1000 saya naikkan jadi rp 2500 namun dengan harga tersebut susu kedelainya jadi sepi pembeli
4326468 dari hasil jualan susu kedelai ini mama dan kedua saudara saya bisa menyambung hidup
4326469 kala saya baca di koran protein susu kedelai setara dengan susu sapi
4326470 yang pasti para pembelinya adalah para calon penumpang krl yang tidak sempat minum susu atau sarapan pagi
4326471 setiap hari saya membawa 39 kantung plastik susu kededali dan habis hanya dalam waktu tiga jam
4326472 kalau dalam waktu tiga jam saja bisa habis 39 bungkus susu kedelai berarti kalau 6 jam bisa habis 78 bungkus dan seterusnya itu artinya peluangnya cukup besar sedangkan saya hanya mampu menjual susu kedelai hanya 39 bungkus tiap hari
4326473 kalau saja saya punya modal lebih mungkin saya bisa menjual lebih dari 39 bungkus susu kacang kedelai dan saya berharap ada bantuan modal
4326474 kalau saya ngambil untung yang gede nanti pelanggan saya kabur semua apalagi sekarang ini hidup semakin susah
4326475 meskipun berjualan kue untungnya kecil tapi alhamdulillah bisa buat biaya sekolah dan ngontrak rumah keuntungan yang tidak seberapa itu juga bisa untuk bertahan hidup
4326476 kue kue yang saya jual tiap hari itu semuanya adalah bikinan orang yang dititipkan ke saya untuk dijual jadi saya hanya modal tenaga untuk berekeliling dan kepercayaan dari yang menitipkan kue
4326477 how much are you going to sell the puppies for
4326478 no you dont want to buy that little dog if you really want him ill just give him to you
4326479 i dont want you to give him to me that little dog is worth every bit as much as all the other dogs and ill pay full price in fact ill give you 2 37 now and 50 cents a month until i have him paid for
4326480 you really dont want to buy this little dog he is never going to be able to jump and play with you like the other puppies
4326481 akibat konflik semua harta benda keluarga habis bahkan ladang yang menjadi satu satunya tempat matapencahrain dibakar orang sehingga tanaman yang sudah besar dan banyak menghasilkan mati semua
4326482 awalnya kami cuma menanam ketela pohon karena disamping mudah menanam dan merawatnya ketela pohon juga bisa sebagai makanan pengganti nasi sehingga mudah dimakan
4326483 seperti beli minyak tanah minyak goreng beli sabun pakaian dan lain lainnya yang memerlukan uang kontan
4326484 pokoknya saya menjual apa saja dari hasil kebun yang bisa saya jual yang penting saya bisa mendapatkan uang kontan untuk memenuhi kebutuhan keluarga
4326485 untungnya biaya pendidikan ringan sehingga anak anak saya bisa sekolah semua
4326486 bahkan saya mendapatkan suami ketika masih jadi juru masak di asrama suami saya itu adalah temen dari salah satu tentara siliwangi
4326487 untung anak saya sudah besar semua jadi kehidupan yang saya lalui tidak terlalu berat anak saya semuanya sudah berumah tangga tapi sayang tinggalnya jauh jauh ada yang tinggal di jogja banten dan bintara
4326488 sekeras apapun hidup mesti dilakoni karena saya yakin bahwa rezeki akan selalu ada buat saya asalkan kita mau berusaha pasti rezeki akan kita dapatkan
4326489 tapi saya tidak lagi berjualan nasi karena sudah gak punya modal dan barang barang dagangan saya juga sudah hancur oleh trantib dan untuk menyambung hidup saya berjualan asongan
4326490 saya bangga karena saya tidak minta minta saya bangga karena saya tidak menyusahkan orang lain dan anak saya
4326491 love yourself enough to find a guy wholl take care of you
4326492 ya allah mengapa saya masuk surga karena rahmat mu kenapa bukan karena amal saya
4326493 rupanya kamu tidak puas dengan apa yang telah aku berikan kepadamu baiklah sekarang aku akan hitung amal amal ibadah yang telah kamu lakukan
4326494 saling mendekatlah kalian kepada allah swt dan berjalanlah dengan lurus dan ketahuilah bahwa tidak ada seorangpun diantara kamu sekalian yang selamat karena amalnya
4326495 tidak juga saya kecuali jika allah swt melimpahkan rahmat dan karunianya
4326496 whoa this thing feels like its been in an oven was it in your car
4326497 ive never even heard of any of this shane didnt teach us this stuff

4326568 theres a certain quality in j r that cant be transcribed unless illicted under a glass of wine this said i hope the reader understands my current state as that of well lets just say lucid jerimiah rhome was born in a hobunk town in the hobunk state of pensillvania drab dreary land scape tore off into the infinate horizon every where you looked one obtrusive entity stole of the deppresing surroundings all encompassing numbness this structure made this place into something without it the inhabitants would succumb to inevitable lack of all social values and fall asleep forever in their small but warm beds never would they wake without this building without it there would be no reason to this building that detachs from complete oblivion was j rs highschool
4326569 it was scary because i never experienced anything like that before he chased her little boy with an ax he ran down the street chasing people and i was in there laying down and look he axed my door
4326570 he chased my son back into the yard with the ax i grabbed my son threw my son into the house and i grabbed my gun and told him not to take another step because i was going to shoot him he raised the ax up and dropped it back down and ran down the street
4326571 if he has had a mental problem prior too he should not be living alone without his medications its unsafe for the neighborhood and its definitely unsafe for him if he comes on my property that way again
4326572 i did coochie coochie to myself down there with the barbie
4326573 you must be an anastialsolgest cause it didnt feel like shit
4326574 hey this is probably the last time ill get to do this thing see this person before i leave
4326575 no camera no e mail wow this is what we used to talk on
4326576 child autism how to cope with an autistic child as a parent
4326577 its exciting to see so many new faces but its also kind of frustrating because i really want to get to know our students and families
4326578 you have to be ready and accepting and warm so those kids feel like theyve always been here
4326579 otherwise theyre not going to be ready to do academics
4326580 if they dont have a stable life at home we try to provide that for them here
4326581 where do our hands go when we are in the hallway i am going to look for a familiar face someone i knew from last year jordan
4326582 maybe if weve made a connection theyll stay where they are
4326583 i cant imagine having to make connections with friends or teachers that often
4326584 its very difficult to replace him not only with bat and ball but in the dressing room as well he gives us a lot of advice and comes up with brilliant ideas so its going to be a big loss
4326585 were talking major resurfacing of the road realignment of utilities of course sidewalk widening to get the new codes pavement markers signage traffic signalization super elevation a myriad of stuff
4326586 kids think that because these are medicines that are prescribed they are safe
4326587 the problem is that there is very little difference between the amount they take for a high and the amount that causes an overdose

4326590 the rocky horror phenomenon has a life of its own that has reincarnated itself in numerous ways since its birth
4326591 our hope has always been that each new endeavour and rebirth will expose the rocky horror experience to new audiences and expand the fan base
4326592 the original has some qualities that cant be reproduced but a remake could have its own very different strengths and qualities
4326593 some may say that it is irresponsible to make such predictions pending further detailed study to be sure of every point
4326594 however we will never be certain about every detail and it would be irresponsible to remain silent in the face of what we already know
4326595 there was something about this story that i felt so personally committed to
4326596 ive always had a lot of respect for average working people
4326597 bob wasnt an ordinary man he was probably a genius but as a person his lifestyle his family scale he was just an average guy so i felt like i understood that
4326598 whether you are bob kearns or gandhi or martin luther king if you go up against the forces you will pay
4326599 hes an addict in some ways he wants to give it up but he cant
4326600 i think they had a leg to stand on in a certain way
4326601 i think they thought we would have come up with this anyway based on the amount of time and energy and research and people we had on it
4326602 but i dont think they had come up with it yet and what bob kearns came up with whether or not it was the most revolutionary idea anyone ever had was bobs idea they were denying him his dignity
4326603 it shows that there is justice in the world that you cant steal something and get away with it
4326604 were clearly focused on moving ford forward and tomorrows innovations
4326605 i tell people dont kill all the liberals leave enough so we can have two on every campus living fossils so we will never forget what these people stood for
4326606 i would have no problem with new york times editor bill keller being sent to the gas chamber
4326607 and if al qaeda comes in here and blows you up were not going to do anything about it were going to say look every other place in america is off limits to you except san francisco you want to blow up the coit tower go ahead
4326608 howard dean should be arrested and hung for treason or put in a hole until the end of the iraq war
4326609 some liberals have become even too crazy for texas to execute which is a damn shame theyre always saying were oppressed were oppressed so lets do it lets oppress them
4326610 we need somebody to put rat poisoning in justice stevens creme brulee thats just a joke for you in the media
4326611 my only regret with timothy mcveigh is he did not go to the new york times building
4326612 we need to execute people like john walker in order to physically intimidate liberals by making them realize that they can be killed too
4326613 where does george soros have all his money do you know do you know where george soros the big left wing loon whos financing all these smear web sites do you know where his money is cura ao cura ao they ought to hang this soros guy
4326614 has there ever been a more revealing moment this year
4326615 let me just put this in fairly simple terms al jazeera now broadcasts the words of senator durbin to the mideast certainly putting our troops in greater danger no more needs to be said about the motives of liberals
4326616 these bastards like clark and kerry and that incipient ass dean and gephardt and kucinich and that absolute mental midget sharpton race baiter should all be lined up and shot
4326617 2500 rounds of ammo oh my god seriously thats nothing i have a mere pittance worth of ammo and still have about 2 5 times that amount in my closet
4326618 we dont know whether or not theres an effect in people
4326619 we tested a total of four moisturising creams and all four of them had tumorigenic activity
4326620 the products they tested had multiple ingredients with no consistent overlap so it is hard to identify which agents if any could be implicated
4326621 moisturizers are used more in women than in men yet we do not see a relative increase in skin cancer in women compared with men
4326622 there is no evidence of danger to humans in this study but the message to scientists is clear be careful in assuming that seemingly inert creams will have no interference with animal experiments
4326623 send an email during the game thats being played for that said prize
4326624 we are in the business of gymnastics and we know what a kid of 14 or 15 or 16 looks like you dont have to be a gymnastics coach to know what they look like at 16

4326627 my boss wants all these roses to bloom this week so last week i taped all the early ones and now im opening the late ones
4326628 oh too bad it has genetic dysbloomia ill have to call an expert
4326629 you caused the wilting all you needed to do was meet the flowers needs for water and sunshine and leave the rest to nature
4326630 the number of young adults hospitalized with diabetes in the u s has increased significantly over the past decade along with the rate of childhood obesity
4326631 todays young adults experienced childhood and adolescence in the leading edge of the childhood obesity epidemic in the 1970s and 1980s our findings suggest that we may now just be beginning to see the first manifestation of a related diabetes epidemic among these young adults
4326632 this is worth 700 so when i die make sure you dont get ripped off when you sell it
4326633 its just to let you know how much i appreciate you
4326634 als hij niet meer wil mag ik dan je prins zijn
4326635 ive been running so long but i feel like this is the first time people want to talk to me
4326636 i could have a great race and be 10th but i could also have a great race and win
4326637 so i just want to be in that position when i hear that bell for the last lap i want to have put myself in that position and then i think you need a little luck and the stars to align a little bit to come home with a medal
4326638 its been very exciting to see her blossom not just physically but psychologically and to be a young woman thats very confident of herself now
4326639 obviously its not how we always imagined but now its just ill run to represent the both of us
4326640 im getting goose bumps right now just thinking about it and i try not to think about it too much because i know how hard it is and how literally i have to have a lot of luck for that to happen but that would just be id probably be like done retired what could ever top this
4326641 its been a bit since i toughed one of those out so in the end i hope it will be up being a good thing
4326642 he did a really good job of spreading the ball on me
4326643 it was a very physical match possibly the longest three setter ive played
4326644 those are blackfeet faces he had no right to steal those faces
4326645 the kiss was performed under duress and a bit of blackmail due to the puckish nature of caroline julian so it wasnt as intense as you would think their eventual first kiss would be

4326647 we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
4326648 we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tentpole release for midsummer
4326649 summer season is an ideal window for a family tentpole release
4326650 but thats about all exhibition can expect to make up
4326651 a fruitless person is not a failed christian but a false one
4326652 the very idea of talking to jesus mother held no appeal
4326653 erin were extremely proud of you and we love you
4326654 a tela estava dividida de um lado datena e de outro a entrevista com o delegado datena comentava a entrevista
4326655 two csu rams go into a bar and buy a round for the house and get fired up they are slapping each other on the back and having a heck of a good time the bartender says hey whats the big deal here whats the occasion
4326656 the csu guys say we just finished a jigsaw puzzle and it only took us two months
4326657 we have two kids a 6 year old son and a 4 year old daughter they had just had their baths
4326658 i guess all their nightgowns were in the washer and my daughter had to put a t shirt on that one of her aunts had sent her that said tough chick when youve got a 4 year old daughter the main adjustment is the annunciation so shes calling out loud to her brother tyler im tough she said it three straight times and im thinking oh my goodness i did see the t shirt and it did say tough chick and thats what she meant to say
4326659 he was having a good camp and that was a bonus for me
4326660 he gave me the depth i didnt have in 2007 its unfortunate hed worked hard to play and was prepared to play
4326661 stop running because basically thats when they happened its not because guys are hitting you or cutting i mean theyre all noncontact
4326662 we obviously had a good situation coming into the homestand and it didnt work out for whatever reason
4326663 we didnt play good baseball and that hurts but now were going on the road and starting a road trip i think thats a good way to start just pick up and build from there hopefully tonight we can come out and put something together and have a good road trip hopefully even better than the last one
4326664 there is always a game tomorrow until the last day of the season thats how we take it
4326665 weve got a game tonight against the nationals and we have to do everything we can to win they played us tough at home there is no such thing as a bad major league team we have to come out and try to get it done as best as we can
4326666 usually the second day is always that way broncos coach mike shanahan said
4326667 it never changes that second day is usually a little bit more competitive
4326668 you can expect that especially from those interior guys because theyre pretty much more hands on and face on everyday cowboys wide receiver terrell owens said
4326669 itll get a little chippy and thats just part of football i think everybody regrouped and just got on with practice its not the first time teams have gotten into a little squabble
4326670 getting the data out of the device and into the control system usually uses proprietary software that is not interoperable across platforms
4326671 its been bugging me for about a week and a half
4326672 i dont remember how i did it i dont remember doing anything specific
4326673 i guess im auditioning for myself and for the people upstairs the next six weeks are important i want to pitch well and feel like im healthy if that happens i would certainly think that would make me lean toward pitching next year
4326674 this is actually the second time the f 22s have been to guam
4326675 you shall not be afraid of the terrors of the night nor of the arrow the evil plots and slanders of the wicked that flies by day nor of the pestilence that stalks in darkness nor of the destruction and sudden death that surprise and lay waste at noonday
4326676 because you have made the lord your refuge and the most high your dwelling place
4326677 do not therefore fling away your fearless confidence for it carries a great and glorious compensation of reward
4326678 for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which ive committed unto him against that day
4326679 for this reason we also from the day we heard of it have not ceased to pray and make special request for you asking that you may be filled with the full deep and clear knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom in comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of god and in understanding and discernment of spiritual things that you may walk live and conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the lord fully pleasing to him and desiring to please him in all things bearing fruit in every good work and steadily growing and increasing in and by the knowledge of god with fuller deeper and clearer insight acquaintance and recognition we pray that you may be invigorated and strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory to exercise every kind of endurance and patience perseverance and forbearance with joy giving thanks to the father
4326680 i really wish you would have been right about me in the beginning when you first saw things about me before we even met
4326681 honestly i think its all gotten beyond ridiculous im debating wheather to just change you myself
4326682 oh alice do it now i could help you so much and i wouldnt slow you down bite me
4326683 we dont have enough time we have to get into volterra tomorrow youd be writhering in pain for days
4326684 if you dont do it now youll change your mind
4326685 i dont think i will hell be furious but what will he be able to do about it
4326686 you have too much faith in me bella im nore sure that i can ill probably just end up killing you
4326687 oh well this is purely hypothetical at this point anyway first we have to live through tomorrow
4326688 royality vampire family so they will kill him because he doesnt want to live without bella and its hard to kill a vampire seeing as they live forever
4326689 it was chaotic at first i was only getting flickers he was changing plans so quickly
4326690 it got very close he changed his mind at the last minute
4326691 im hoping so if he sticks to his latest decision maybe
4326692 hes going to keep it simple hes just going to walk out into the sun
4326693 right now hes leaning toward the melodramatic he wants the biggest audience possible so hell choose the main plaza under the clock tower the walls are high there hell wait til the sun is exactly overhead
4326694 ritmo dos pingos a cair no ch o s me deixa a relembrar
4326695 its always been the case that states have had the right to make their own decision on whether or not to allow gay marriage
4326696 no supreme or federal court ever said they states had to recognize each others marriages well before doma the defense of marriage act the principle was settled that states make their own choices
4326697 whether or not doma is repealed has no affect on forcing states to recognize same sex unions contracted in other states
4326698 the full faith and credit clause is interpreted by the supreme court not by congress frankly the section of the defense of marriage that purports to say what the full faith and credit means has no constitutional validity whatsoever because the supreme court has never allowed congress to make those decisions
4326699 full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts records and judicial proceedings of every other state and the congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts records and proceedings shall be proved and the effect thereof
4326700 we will enact a comprehensive bipartisan employment non discrimination act
4326701 we oppose the defense of marriage act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us
4326702 obama also believes we need to fully repeal the defense of marriage act and enact legislation that would ensure that the 1 100 federal legal rights and benefits currently provided on the basis of marital status are extended to same sex couples in civil unions and other legally recognized unions
4326703 i think it is very unlikely that the whole thing will be repealed i am not optimistic though i welcome the fact that he obama is for repealing it
4326704 if they havent got anyone with enough guts im prepared to risk myself to do it
4326705 hendra virus is going to come back again and again and again because it comes from bats and theres millions of bats and theyre a protected species we need to know a lot more about it
4326706 it was overturned on the basis not enough is known about the virus to be sure the horse will not pose a threat to human health quite simply its just not worth the risk
4326707 this is being done as part of a national agreement about protecting the entire equine industry from outbreaks of this kind
4326708 there is a very serious concern that this horse could have a relapse of this disease
4326709 the problem of bias is much worse than many assume
4326710 what is concerning is that the effect of this ideological uniformity emanating from the texts is the unstated but evident message that what is politically and socially important is what the left perceives to be important
4326711 there are serious consequences for young people in terms of not getting a balanced education
4326712 one of them is that a lot of young people dont have a strong moral compass
4326713 it is time to get everyone thinking about co2 and exhaust emissions
4326714 we acknowledge the government has the right to look for new revenue streams but we decided instead of just arguing against the tax we should come up with a new proposal
4326715 some politicians might doubt us at the moment but it is a genuine approach to finding a solution to the biggest challenge the automotive industry will face for the next 10 to 15 years
4326716 it became increasingly difficult to give effective and quality care to each of my allocated patients and their families many with very high needs
4326717 with such a large percentage of staff rostered on any given shift being fairly inexperienced in cardiac care this is a dangerous and potentially fatal consequence
4326718 it seems to me reading that letter were looking at a very experienced nurse and she has blown the whistle
4326719 one assumes that shes done it as is always the case to make sure that the interests of patients are protected
4326720 theres no reason why you need to offer blanket assurances discretion in police work is something that is routinely part of what cops do every single day and it should be applied in this situation also
4326721 it is their responsibility to act when they come across somebody who is violating the law of some other jurisdiction to assist in making sure that person is brought to the attention of the proper authorities
4326722 i think that the fact that theres a city ordinance in place that makes it clear that services will be available regardless of the victims status also sends an important message to the community that if you need police to protect your safety you should feel safe in reaching out
4326723 i want to know what mr cotta will say to the family of someone in hartford connecticut after an illegal alien who had been in police custody is back on the streets and goes out and commits some heinous crime
4326724 if he can look them in the eye and explain to them we wanted to make illegal immigrants feel comfortable
4326725 i felt a little sluggish the first round but my body is woke up now
4326726 vi ser hur de fogar sig och drar sig tillbaka till en position d r de kan l mna p ett lugnt s tt
4326727 if i can keep a dollar from going overseas ill spend two dollars
4326728 the condom fits 100 perfectly so the safety is much higher than a standard condoms and it feels more natural

4326730 the flame retardant walls can burn but do not emit toxic fumes if they do
4326731 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them

4326733 we have ice cream from all over japan from hokkaido in the north to okinawa in the south but beef tongue has been the one that people keep coming back for
4326734 that is my thunder by god the villains will play my thunder but not my play
4326735 every time we see a patient that was delayed we always agonize a little bit
4326736 we do see a lot of people in the er and it turns out not to be a heart attack

4326738 chest pain is not something you triage over the phone
4326739 his speed is deceptive hes a lot faster than people give him credit for
4326740 right now ive got to keep proving it keep coming out here every day like im a rookie
4326741 you can expect that especially from those interior guys because theyre pretty much more hands on and face on every day
4326742 i think everybody regrouped and just got on with practice
4326743 guys are tired and ready to go back to where their home place is and get out of camp mode youre going to have a fight here and there but if it all just stays on the field its fine
4326744 i put the pacman part on his helmet but me and b are cool man its just something to get us through so we can compete and have fun
4326745 it does mean a lot to me that he thinks that but somebody would have found him anyway
4326746 hes a hall of fame receiver really you would have had to been a bad coach not to notice him
4326747 hey 53 you wouldnt have a chance to tackle me
4326748 they are great pass rushers just real strong overall players
4326749 i think those two are kind of the prototype for the position just using their hands well and get their hands inside before you can
4326750 definitely having long arms is an advantage thats the biggest difference in the nfl definitely the hands they get them on you and try to get you in trouble youre going to have some good times and some bad times just trying to sort through it
4326751 it never changes that second day is usually a little bit more competitive
4326752 you can expect that especially from those interior guys because theyre pretty much more hands on and face on every day
4326753 itll get a little chippy and thats just part of football i think everybody regrouped and just got on with practice its not the first time teams have gotten into a little squabble
4326754 the only thing im frustrated with is right now is my hammy
4326755 i just want to get well its frustrating not being able to be out there competing with these guys
4326756 you can push it and try to make it and you raise your chances of tweaking it
4326757 i think i know my body pretty well because ive been through this and i think ill know when its time to come back and when that time is ill be back out there

4326844 given the circumstances we will be facing it is inconceivable that we should prevent nuclear from being part of our energy mix
4326845 dozens of individuals and organisations have contributed to the consultation and we have taken account of everything they said
4326846 it will be difficult to achieve our climate change goals without the use of nuclear energy
4326847 indispensable if basic energy needs are to be met in europe in the medium term
4326848 nuclear energy is currently the largest low carbon dioxide energy source in europe
4326849 the renunciation of nuclear power will make it impossible to achieve the objectives set regarding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the combating of climate change
4326850 significant threat to the ability of the us enrichment industry to deploy new production capacity
4326851 to really help the planet we have to go nuclear fast
4326852 i dont care what anyone says were going to go with it big time
4326853 a new era of nuclear power is beginning how risky is it
4326854 at the peach bottom nuclear plant south of harrisburg pa
4326855 power companies are beginning to file applications to build up to 32 nuclear plants over the next 20 years the first since the 1979 accident at the three mile island plant in pennsylvania halted plans for new reactors
4326856 the nrc should have learned a lesson from this summers earthquake in which forced the emergency shutdown of the worlds largest nuclear plant and resulted in the release of radioactive material into the air and water our letter illustrates the concern states across the nation have about nuclear power plant safety
4326857 assuring the safety of nuclear power plants falls well within the definition of an inherently governmental function
4326858 i am therefore alarmed that this contract may violate the law and result in a danger to public health and safety
4326859 the entire thrust of necs appeal that various statutes required the board to conduct an evidentiary hearing before entering its march 3 2006 order was simply not made to the board

4326868 having three of the four operational virginia class boats and pcu new hampshire at sea is a reflection of the hard work dedication and team work that is our submarine force
4326869 this will become a common occurrence in the future but today its the crowning achievement of a huge cast of people who made it possible
4326870 its a real feather in the cap of the submarine force to be able to take a new design from concept through real employment in such a short time and in such an efficient and effective manner
4326871 it is a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died
4326872 everyone in the street was yelling shes under the bus
4326873 i ran out of my house to join 10 people trying to lift up the bus
4326874 at first we couldnt get it up so then another 10 people ran over to help and we got the bus up and the lady out
4326875 it was a beautiful thing to watch all those people lift up that bus
4326876 i hope that as this child grows up he comes to understand that his mother gave her life in service to our city and that we are forever grateful
4326877 his brakes went out theres nothing he could have done im just upset hes upset hes crying more than me
4326878 hes been driving all his life and hes a very good driver so if it hadnt been for those brakes it never would have happened
4326879 dont you know that those who work in the temple get their meals from the food brought to the temple as offerings and those who serve at the altar get a share of the sacrificial offerings in the same way the lord gave orders that those who preach the good news should be supported by those who benefit from it yet i have never used any of these rights and i am not writing this to suggest that i would like to start now in fact i would rather die than lose my distinction of preaching without charge for preaching the good news is not something i can boast about i am compelled by god to do it how terrible for me if i didnt do it
4326880 no one can serve two masters for you will hate one and love the other or be devoted to one and despise the other you cannot serve both god and money
4326881 anyone who welcomes you is welcoming me and anyone who welcomes me is welcoming the father who sent me if you welcome a prophet as one who speaks for god you will receive the same reward a prophet gets and if you welcome good and godly people because of their godliness you will be given a reward like theirs and if you give even a cup of cold water to one of the least of my followers you will surely be rewarded
4326882 i think the democratic party is changing and moving away from abortion as a decision making tool when were saying who can speak and who cant and i think it is very encouraging to see this more inclusive party
4326883 our country faces very grave economic military and foreign policy challenges and many americans of all political parties will vote for a change in november
4326884 barack obama is the only candidate who offers that change of direction we need
4326885 if a democrat voted with the national rifle association two out of every three times no one in his right mind would call that person an advocate of gun control
4326886 yet bob casey jr who has a naral national abortion rights action league voting record of 65 percent meaning that he votes with the radical pro abortion group two out of every three times is somehow considered pro life
4326887 casey can mouth the virtues of pro life all he wants but at the end of the day what matters is his voting record
4326888 is certainly entitled to say whatever he wants even if what he says is not supported by the facts
4326889 he has also introduced legislation to reduce the number of abortions by targeting the underlying factors that often lead women to have abortions
4326890 would help pregnant high school and college students stay in school
4326891 would help promote adoption and make the adoption tax credit permanent
4326892 in 2004 we saw major losses as democrats but only two years later in 2006 the big tent started to open up and we started supporting pro life candidates
4326893 we picked up heath schuler and brad ellsworth and joe donnelly strong pro life forces in congress and also bob casey
4326894 in 2004 we were trying to get a link to the dnc web site and the answer was no
4326895 this year however during the platform writing process we were part of it we were included as part of the democratic party rather than being met with skepticism
4326896 when you look at the roe section obviously we have some concern about that
4326897 the unequivocal and strong support for roe v wade regardless of the ability to pay we dont support that section obviously because were pro life
4326898 the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4326899 all they are simply saying is well have some money for adoption and family planning thanks a lot thats not the same thing
4326900 i dont think they changed their heart and soul at all
4326901 they wrote a book after the 2004 election and said listen democrats are not going to win unless you soften on abortion
4326902 but they didnt say soften the language these guys said give up on partial birth abortion give up on parental notification in other words most americans are in favor of requiring parental consent for children obtaining abortions and most americans are repulsed by partial birth abortion
4326903 instead what we get is sugarcoating the language and a more emphatic and more equivocal defense of roe v wade
4326904 one of our main missions is to educate people on pro life issues and were going to continue to do that and work with the whole democratic party on the importance of the pro life view
4326905 the governor has been personally involved in meetings and strategy sessions with state legislative leaders and others concerning prison overcrowding
4326906 in heaven there may be some evidence down in the lolo forest because thats where we were
4326907 he was going to change his mind because he said i taught him how to love
4326908 hes killed way a lot more people that you dont even know about he killed dylan
4326909 dear dad i have very good news and it is we are coming home soon it might be a week or 2 so we will be back
4326910 we might see you again and we might not if we decide to go with him we will go see eminem and get 1 000 000 and we already have 1 000 000 but we figured the 1 000 000 was fake
4326911 dear dad this is dylan we are still alive we are ok and we know what happened to mom mark and slade and im sorry you had to loose sic a son and an exwife and im sorry we had to be taken away from you and i miss you
4326912 asphalt has a lot of advantages as a solar collector
4326913 for one blacktop stays hot and could continue to generate energy after the sun goes down unlike traditional solar electric cells
4326914 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4326915 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4326916 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4326917 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4326918 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4326919 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4326920 no rule to pursue but such as he prescribes to himself
4326921 should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others
4326922 if it be wished that my relation to the bank be continued it may be well to send me the usual retainer
4326923 that the dependency of private funding simply shifts the focus of congress thats all and if so is this really the issue to worry about
4326924 whom i think it does compromise they feel like they have to ameliorate or change their position for fear of losing certain contributions
4326925 it is very difficult for me to accept that people dont consciously or subconsciously tailor their views to where they know the sources of campaign funding can be
4326926 how are we going to raise money from those guys if we deregulate them
4326927 should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled their views about global warming will change accordingly therefore you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate
4326928 as real a revolution in the principles of government as that of 1776 was in its form
4326929 it wouldnt have taken a genius long to recognize the corrupting influence of money in american politics
4326930 but it took me a long time to recognize it
4326931 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4326932 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4326933 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4326934 apple has had the same problem in every market where the 3g iphone is sold
4326935 it could be something as simple as a solder joint
4326936 strong voluminous and powerful indictment of his systematic misrule and usurpation of parliaments powers
4326937 we have consistently said the internal politics of pakistan is an issue for the pakistani people to decide
4326938 our expectation is that any action will be consistent with the rule of law and the pakistani constitution
4326939 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring about political stability i think we cant fight them properly
4326940 political stability in my view can only be brought about through a reconciliation approach as opposed to confrontation
4326941 these were the ghostbusters girls that one i grabbed her ass cause i wanted to see what her reaction was
4326942 ten killer ways to make sure you service experiences are the best and your customers remain yours
4326943 its the legal framework in which we can all participate each assuming his responsibility
4326944 knowing how to negotiate and discuss what most serves the people is
4326945 i called on the lord to send his angels to protect us as i saw youths falling wounded and others managing to flee
4326946 we dont want anyone in mexico to suffer what has happened to us
4326947 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4326948 the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4326949 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4326950 the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
4326951 its as old as greek drama theres a catharsis everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good
4326952 i think what we are looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country and i think that people who supported a whole range of different candidates during the primaries are going to come out of that convention feeling absolutely determined that we have to take the white house back
4326953 subjected to the sort of obscenities you wouldnt want a 6 year old to hear
4326954 its about allowing your neighbors to have a normal decent life without being disturbed
4326955 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4326956 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4326957 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4326958 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4326959 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4326960 what defenses does georgia have because of the cease fire agreement which russia has not honored georgian troops are being moved to organize a defensive line 10 kilometers six miles away from tbilisi
4326961 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4326962 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4326963 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4326964 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4326965 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4326966 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds

4326972 i was pleased with some of the things that we did especially on that drive where we went 90 yards

4326975 if you think youre too small to make a difference youve never been in bed with a mosquito
4326976 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4326977 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4326978 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4326979 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4326980 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4326981 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4326982 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4326983 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4326984 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4326985 we must lower gas prices and a chicken in every pot for every voting american
4326986 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4326987 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4326988 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4326989 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4326990 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4326991 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4326992 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4326993 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
4326994 not a drum was heard not a funeral note as his corse to the rampart we hurried not a soldier discharged his farewell shot oer the grave where our hero we buried
4326995 i am too high born to be propertied to be a secondary at control or useful serving man and instrument to any sovereign state throughout the world
4326996 so long as the interest of the whole society requires it that is so long as the established government cannot be resisted or changed without public inconveniency it is the will of god that the established government be obeyed and no longer this principle being admitted the justice of every particular case of resistance is reduced to a computation of the quantity of the danger and grievance on the one side and of the probability and expense of redressing it on the other
4326997 a drab of state a cloth o silver slut to have her train borne up and her soul trail in the dirt
4326998 i should like to have them order me out to help put down an insurrection of the slaves or to march to mexico see if i would go

4327001 if a state is governed by the principles of reason poverty and misery are subjects of shame if a state is not governed by the principles of reason riches and honors are the subjects of shame
4327002 they accuse me of burning a barn but i never did it
4327003 we must affect our country as our parents and if at any time we alienate our love or industry from doing it honor we must respect effects and teach the soul matter of conscience and religion and not desire of rule or benefit
4327004 and never propose to make an effort i have never countenanced an effort and never mean to countenance an effort to disturb the arrangement as originally made by which the various states came into the union
4327005 because it was a part of the original compact let it stand
4327006 in which the governments of those states where slavery exists are to regulate it is for their own consideration under their responsibility to their constituents to the general laws of propriety humanity and justice and to god associations formed elsewhere springing from a feeling of humanity or any other cause have nothing whatever to do with it they have never received any encouragement from me and they never will

4327010 i have been married 15 years to the most wonderful man he is a great provider a great father and a great friend my husband has been a terrific companion to me for all these years in fact i would say our love has gotten even stronger every day we have been married we get along great and always have a good time together i would say our marriage is perfect in every way except one our love life has gone downhill in the past few years when we were first together the romance was fiery we made passionate love every night sometimes two or three times we were like rabbits we couldnt stand to be together and not make love we had sex in the car on the elevator in the park wherever the mood struck us my husband was so hot and he was such a stud i couldnt keep my hands off of him and i loved his hands on me every time we had sex i came he was just so long and hard he had amazing control so we could do it for hours in those first months i had trouble walking sometimes after all our after dark activity but as he has gotten older his equipment doesnt work as well as it used to his dick doesnt get as hard or stay hard as long as i need it to so i can come i end up leaving each sexual encounter feeling frustrated instead of satisfied i dont think i need to tell you ladies that if things arent coming together in the bedroom it throws everything in the relationship off i want my sexy rock hard husband back i want him to take me in the bedroom like the strong stallion he used to be i am not ready to have the sex life of an old woman married to an old man i am a vibrant healthy woman and i need to have regular orgasms to stay happy you know how men are they get upset if they think there is a problem with their dick they feel like they are less of a man i felt like i had to find a solution for him that wouldnt involve an embarrassing trip to the doctor i mean come on ladies no one has a husband who will willingly go to the doctor to discuss erectile dysfunction this is a problem that needs to be handled delicately i needed a solution to turn my husband back into the stud he once was without embarrassing him or making me go any longer without good sex i had seen some commercials for male supplements but the commercials looked questionable one was pretty funny but it didnt tell me how it worked i really wanted to find something that worked the first time my husband wouldnt be able to deal with trying a bunch of different pills and have nothing work hed start to ask questions about why i was pushing this stuff then wed argue everyone would end up pissed off i was trying to get the lovin going not a fight once i found www mojorisen com i knew i had the answer to my problem they sell a male enhancement supplement to make my husbands dick rock hard again the supplement is safe legal and available without a prescription it also didnt have some of the dangerous herbs the other supplements have while i wanted our sex life i certainly didnt want to make my husband sick also it can be taken with alcohol so if we had a romantic dinner with wine it would still work the mojo risen would be delivered in an unmarked package and had a 100 iron clad money back guarantee i hoped i wouldnt need that guarantee i have to tell you i got a little aroused just thinking of using it i placed my order and anxiously waited for the supplement to arrive fortunately it got here really quickly i greeted my husband at the door after work wearing little more than a smile and holding a glass of champagne i slipped him the supplement and started to kiss him he looked at me questioningly but when i moved his hand to my butt he just went with the flow we fooled around for about 30 minutes and next thing we knew his dick was hard as a rock to show him how thrilled i was i did that thing i only do once it awhile that really got him going we didnt even make it upstairs to the bedroom we had mindblowing sex for hours right in the living room i came over and over again and he was able to come back for more and more and more after we were too exhausted to move my husband asked me what the pill had been i told him it was a supplement from www mojorisen com he was amazed that such a small supplement was strong enough to pack such a punch he said he felt like we were newlyweds the next morning the supplement was still working as i could tell from his rock hard morning wood i surprised him by getting started before he woke up he loved it the next time he took the supplement we had sex like a couple of horny teenagers over and over again all over the house my stallion was back he had no side effects from mojo risen he felt great and we both were so happy it is like we turned back time we got our sex life back without any embarrassing doctor visits or filling embarrassing prescriptions i was able to help my husband without making him feel like he was inadequate as a lover we agreed that we would always have them on hand my sex life is too important to me to miss out on all this hot fun

4327148 because of the nature of the business theres a lot of travel involved odd hours thereve been times we all live under the same roof but we havent seen each other for days on end
4327149 its wonderful to get an opportunity to spend six weeks on the road with the family i dont think weve spent this amount of time and this quality of time for over 10 years together
4327150 when we see the live audience hear their roar hear their appreciation that is the incentive
4327151 every time we keep feeling like oh my god last nights show was fabulous it has been very very overwhelming
4327152 i think it speaks wonderfully and gloriously for the indian film industry
4327153 its very heartening to know that indian films are viewed in all these places and its wonderful to know that you reach out to so many people and they appreciate your work
4327154 durante estos d as que he estado ausente y totalmente aislado estuve mucho tiempo rezando y hablando con dios pero lo m s dif cil es hablar con uno mismo
4327155 we have to see what she rice has to bring
4327156 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4327157 georgia is a member of the united nations as such it has internationally recognized borders therefore the territorial integrity of georgia within those borders is not an issue
4327158 georgias borders have been reaffirmed by numerous security council resolutions
4327159 so the question of abkhazia and south ossetia will be the subject of international negotiations as they have been at the u n security council
4327160 the resolution of kosovos status is covered by a u n security council resolution and that resolution envisions an international process
4327161 so the two cases are totally different in a move likely to sour further russias ties with the u s poland finally agreed on thursday to host elements of u s global anti missile system on its land after washington improved the terms of the deal amid the georgia crisis
4327162 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4327163 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4327164 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4327165 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4327166 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4327167 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4327168 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4327169 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4327170 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4327171 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4327172 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4327173 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4327174 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4327175 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4327176 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4327177 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4327178 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4327179 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4327180 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4327181 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4327182 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4327183 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4327184 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4327185 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4327186 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4327187 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4327188 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4327189 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4327190 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4327191 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4327192 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4327193 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4327194 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4327195 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4327196 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4327197 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4327198 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4327199 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4327200 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4327201 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4327202 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4327203 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4327204 see in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in to kind of catapult the propaganda
4327205 america was never innocent we popped our cherry on the boat over and looked back with no regrets you cant ascribe our fall from grace to any single event or set of circumstances you cant lose what you lacked at conception
4327206 mass market nostalgia gets you hopped up for a past that never existed hagiography sanctifies shuck and jive politicians and reinvents their expedient gestures as moments of great moral weight our continuing narrative line is blurred past truth and hindsight only a reckless verisimilitude can set that line straight
4327207 misti is the best she knows just how to make you look good and her photos are amazing
4327208 well kim he called me by my first name which i resented he shouldnt have been that informal with me it sounds like you want to start a fight

4327215 we did a good job up front stopping their front four there was plenty of time to throw the ball and that allowed our receivers to get open down the field and allowed me plenty of time to be accurate with the ball
4327216 these landmark agreements signal the arrival of utility scale pv solar power that may be cost competitive with solar thermal and wind energy
4327217 we will continue to explore such innovative technologies as we aggressively work to increase the amount of renewable energy we provide our customers
4327218 we are very happy to be working with pg amp e to help meet californias requirements for clean renewable energy and are committed to working closely with the local community as this project moves forward
4327219 our solar farms are quiet and emission free with solar panels mounted near ground level to minimize visual impact implementing cost competitive solar power on this scale establishes thin film photovoltaic generation as an important contributor to global sustainability
4327220 today high efficiency photovoltaic technology is a competitively priced component of utility scale peak power generation
4327221 our experience constructing more than 350 megawatts of solar systems on three continents allows us to deliver utility scale systems quickly and at a scale of hundreds of kilowatts to hundreds of megawatts we design our solar systems to maximize energy harvest while adapting to the natural topography of the site and serving the needs of the community

4327224 how many computers around the country or for that matter around the world are compiling all this personal information
4327225 im all for open records and public access to information
4327226 but this is a situation where theyre just putting all this information out there for no good reason
4327227 i wonder how many servers in the ukraine are mining all this information on wisconsin residents vitals
4327228 we have crossed the rubicon poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4327229 our position is those are false malicious allegations that have hurt him in his trade especially being a man of the cloth
4327230 that noblest of men answered him the leader of the warrior band unlocked his wordhoard
4327231 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4327232 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4327233 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4327234 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4327235 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
4327236 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
4327237 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
4327238 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
4327239 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
4327240 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
4327241 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
4327242 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months

4327252 todays event is a key inflection point that shows the industry the breadth and depth of eas portfolio
4327253 we continue to raise the bar with each opportunity to show new titles throughout the summer and fall line up of global industry events its been exciting to see consumer and critical reaction to our expansive slate and we look forward to receiving feedback with the debut of todays new titles

4327258 if youre funny if theres something that makes you laugh then every days going to be okay
4327259 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4327260 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4327261 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
4327262 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
4327263 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4327264 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4327265 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4327266 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4327267 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4327268 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4327269 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4327270 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
4327271 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
4327272 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
4327273 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4327274 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4327275 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4327276 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
4327277 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
4327278 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
4327279 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4327280 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4327281 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4327282 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4327283 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4327284 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4327285 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4327286 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4327287 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4327288 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4327289 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4327290 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4327291 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4327292 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4327293 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4327294 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4327295 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4327296 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4327297 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4327298 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4327299 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4327300 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4327301 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4327302 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4327303 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4327304 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4327305 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4327306 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4327307 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4327308 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4327309 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4327310 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4327311 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4327312 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4327313 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4327314 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4327315 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4327316 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
4327317 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
4327318 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
4327319 we wanted a safe cream that we could put the caffeine into
4327320 hairless mice were exposed to enough uv radiation to give at least 80 of them some form of skin cancer or pre cancer within four months
4327321 so the study does not cast a cloud over moisturisers in general
4327322 it raises the possibility that some components of some moisturising creams might have a negative effect when the skin has already been strongly primed to develop tumours by uv exposure
4327323 the potential for alarmism is high and therefore this paper invites the highest level of scrutiny which it does not in my view sufficiently bear to warrant publication
4327324 i dont think that people should be scared because this is a mouse study and we dont know whether or not it applies to humans
4327325 wed like to understand the mechanism what is most important is to see whether these moisturising creams are tumorigenic in people
4327326 this paper provides an interesting and controversial hypothesis for the formation of skin cancers
4327327 sun and apple are working together both to port the new java plug in to mac os x as well as to bring updated versions of java se to mac os x more quickly
4327328 they are in touch with the international federation to get all the facts
4327329 based on this clever dashboard hack nested blockquotes now get darker making them easier to differentiate
4327330 at this time of the year every win is huge no matter who you play
4327331 washington is looking to knock you off theyre looking to make a mark for themselves
4327332 weve not been able to take advantage of teams under 500 coming in here we know that every time we come here the washington nationals always find a way to play good baseball against us this time we really approached them the same way we approached the phillies and the teams in contention
4327333 that second time through the lineup it looked like they made adjustments
4327334 we need to take care of things for ourselves what we can control we need to take care of business every day
4327335 but they did a good job of shutting us down the next three innings
4327336 when he settles in when there are runners on base he executes pitches
4327337 he gets comfortable gets in his delivery and gets in the flow of the game and really pitches well
4327338 i felt like i was struggling to get into a good groove all game
4327339 of course youre embarrassed were all embarrassed because we feel were better than that
4327340 our bullpen definitely didnt need to be in there for nine innings i wish i would have done better
4327341 obviously matt hasnt been to los angeles or new york lately
4327342 in the past i have visited aestheticians who have made a few extractions slapped on a few different masks then whisked me out the door
4327343 i dunno what a brazilian bikini wax is but it sounds kinky where do i sign up
4327344 one co worker said it was savory another heavenly after almost 8 years of smelling these wondrous smells wafting from cubicle to cubicle i decided this is it next time i have five five bucks for a bar of soap well next time i have that kind of extra money just floating around ill have to give it a try then guess what i got the bug flu or i forgot what and i was out for a week
4327345 i got the chicken pot pie and was very surprised it was like someone crammed a microwaveable chicken pot pie into my soap my friend had the thai red curry chicken and said it was exquisite
4327346 for sure i heard they have a soap there that is very reminiscent of mexican leftovers and fritos but im saving my next five spot for the pesto artichoke
4327347 the manager is so sweet and you can grab a cup of joe next door has anyone even mentioned that theres a passageway that leads right into peets from this place right over there see
4327348 niman ranch beef great guacamole delish aguas frescas their tacos are to die for and their chips are thick and fresh love it
4327349 we have the exterminators come at least once a month once when i was walking by a table i had to scoop a dead rat off the table before the customer realized it was there it fell down with a ceiling tile thank god it was dark and they didnt see it
4327350 running toward your enemy is deemed a bad way to save your life
4327351 what this little thing i beleive you have your findings all backwards
4327352 surley you do not come to expect that i would even
4327353 no point in letting you go to waiste now is there
4327354 its very easy for customers to vent frustration on the very open forum of the internet
4327355 customers dont call the contact centre they call the company
4327356 when you look at the contact centre today our foundation is to reduce cost
4327357 but we can make or break customer satisfaction in one foul phone call
4327358 i believe in two years if we take a truly customer centric approach the web is going to be our next contact centre
4327359 its time to really seriously consider opening the channel to the web
4327360 thats why i rejoice whenever they shoot a cop in philadelphia cause i hate them
4327361 we believe that this will save substantial sums of money that we now spend on police details
4327362 we feel it is a reneg on the governors promise
4327363 he came into office pledging to put 1 000 police on the street this is going to take 1 000 police off the street we think that public safety will suffer in the long run
4327364 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4327365 the history of behavior of these men including the current matter does not reflect the standard of excellence we aspire to on and off the mat
4327366 we have outstanding student athletes in our program and we will move forward in a positive manner toward our goals
4327367 i want to personally apologize for any embarrassment that may have been caused for our athletic department the university and our fans
4327368 if nebraska is going to be pigheaded and kick him off unreasonably
4327369 there has to be another wrestling program thats going to want him
4327370 its not money that they would be making working as a waiter
4327371 im in my mid 40s and my generation has a stigma about porn
4327372 the kids the generation of the student athletes dont have that stigma they really dont care
4327373 theyve come from a paris hilton tommy lee pamela anderson sex tape generation myspace pages the shame and stigma arent there for them theyre mostly worried about what their parents are going to think because their parents think its horrifying
4327374 despite being a model student athlete and person for the ncaa and despite having earned the ncaa significant revenues the ncaa has wrongfully arbitrarily and capriciously denied mr mauks request to participate in a fourth year of athletic competition for reasons completely beyond mr mauks control
4327375 thats ludicrous to even think that we would put him on the field and put our football team in harms way
4327376 we look forward to explaining more fully our reasons for the decision and the careful review given not only by our staff but also by representatives from our member schools
4327377 we believe the ncaa has treated ben differently than it has other athletes with very very similar circumstances
4327378 the facts are that he only got to play three years
4327379 maybe if you ask me in a week i could tell you everything is going to be ok but right now im still kind of sick about the whole thing
4327380 probably left also but hes used to the right side if we moved cordy to a right tackle we could move kiante tripp over to left tackle i would say that would exhaust the possibilities
4327381 i think just watching cordy it didnt take long at all to say he can do it physically this year
4327382 the question is how quickly can he learn hes been running with the no 1 unit for a few days now at guard
4327383 to know the backside of your qb is protected and to know that he understands what to do is critical
4327384 hes just bigger stronger and more experienced than he was a year ago and he did a pretty good job a year ago its sad for him of course because he worked so hard he got up to the 310 pound range and was as strong as hes ever been was practicing so well its hard to lose experience
4327385 they are in touch with the international federation to get all the facts
4327386 hopefully we can turn that around and keep playing baseball the way we have for the past few days
4327387 i wait wait and about 11 oclock about six of them they come around
4327388 to look at their faces they dont look good and they say sorry youve been cancelled
4327389 im actually supporting and calling for much greater accountability and transparency and performance indicators that tell us how often these kind of things are happening
4327390 we seem to be the only country in the world that wants to speedily reduce the tariff to zero now weve seen the effects on tariffs over the last few years
4327391 i think a lot more could be done a lot more should be done
4327392 but its pretty rich coming from the opposition given they were in government for 11 years and did nothing
4327393 i think what we need to do is focus on working with indigenous artists making sure that they work through art centres where possible
4327394 theres no doubt that the police investigating the police is not a satisfactory way forward
4327395 one papaya salad and can i get it thai style
4327396 you were drunk last time you were here let me buy you a round of beers
4327397 drink for free you know and then get tested by police officers
4327398 the field test in the field on the streets is vital for the police officer to be able to articulate why did i make this arrest
4327399 they want the participants bac to stay in the 08 to 12 range because thats where its not so easy to tell if someone is intoxicated
4327400 it will be nice to know that theyll actually get hands on experience
4327401 she was a rather bizarre character and seems to have a strange circumstance now
4327402 there was a strong aroma about her and i told her this needed to be taken care of before i went to court with her
4327403 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4327404 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4327405 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4327406 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4327407 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4327408 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4327409 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4327410 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy

4327413 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john
4327414 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play
4327415 i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game

4327418 mustang chief designer larry erickson leaves ford to chair college for creative studies
4327419 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4327420 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4327421 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4327422 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4327423 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4327424 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4327425 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4327426 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4327427 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4327428 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4327429 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4327430 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4327431 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4327432 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4327433 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4327434 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4327435 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4327436 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
4327437 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
4327438 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
4327439 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
4327440 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
4327441 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
4327442 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
4327443 that fight might happen but its not 100 not finalized yet
4327444 right now i have a really good offer on the table to fight a top 185 pounder
4327445 im just waiting hoping elite xc will give me that opportunity to go out there and represent elite and test myself
4327446 alessio hes a good opponent but its a fight that doesnt really excite me though unfortunately im not too motivated about it but hes one dangerous guy that youve got to watch out for hes a really difficult guy to fight hard to take down good stand up but if thats the fight i end up taking ill get myself motivated and pumped up to go do it but right now im really excited about the other fight i think its good for my career and i hope elite xc will realize it too that its not bad for their show that it helps push me further
4327447 its a little sooner than i wanted i just started training again its a little bit of a short training cycle but i guess im already in pretty good shape
4327448 i wanted to have a little bit more time to chill but also the other fight is a fight ive wanted to fight for a while and i think it will be a big fight so hopefully elitexc will let me give the opportunity to test myself
4327449 they came and offered me what i thought i was worth and im happy to be a part of it
4327450 i know i could definitely fight overseas and im trying to see what were doing entails in the states
4327451 now i can just put my mind at ease and train and know i have a home get back to what i love doing and thats competing

4327463 i was pleased with some of the things we did especially on that drive where we went 90 yards
4327464 overall we did better but we still have a lot of things that we need to improve on
4327465 the first play was a good call by turk honestly we had the first couple plays scripted and we knew we were going deep with the first play of the game its just a matter of lee running a great route and just getting him the ball
4327466 are making major life decisions on the basis of health care concerns
4327467 how many men are you willing to let die for this for something that has nothing to do with our national security
4327468 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4327469 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4327470 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4327471 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4327472 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife for months can cause such a scandal
4327473 its awful i cant tell you you dont know when it is going to stop
4327474 thank goodness people are starting to see the hypocrisy of it all
4327475 i know it makes sienna pleased to read these things it means a lot to her when theres so much negativity and criticism around
4327476 you can amp squo t understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife for months can cause such a scandal
4327477 we are now harvesting the fruit of many months of hard work
4327478 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4327479 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4327480 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4327481 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4327482 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4327483 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4327484 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4327485 the president has rejected clemency for 39 people so the next stage for them is execution
4327486 coordinating closely with the attorney general s office as the agency responsible for carrying out executions
4327487 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4327488 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4327489 to send these men to war to do a job and then imprison them for doing it is absurd
4327490 why are they being subjected to less rights and freedom of movement than the very terrorists they put their lives on the line to protect the world from
4327491 i hope my openness today and in the past and my acknowledgment that i need help will give others the courage to get help if they need it

4327496 our enemys are invative and resourcefull and so are we they never stop thinking about ways to harm our country and out people and neither do we
4327497 we need to understand that steve bracks made his recommendations prior to the collapse of doha round of world trade talks national secretary dave oliver said
4327498 it makes no sense at all given doha the collapse of world trade talks the global financial crisis and the issue of climate change to consider reducing tariffs
4327499 china india malaysia are not doing it and neither are canada and the european union
4327500 such action as russia took is unacceptable in the 21st century
4327501 legally we have no compelling reason to turn it down
4327502 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4327503 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4327504 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4327505 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4327506 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4327507 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4327508 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4327509 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4327510 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4327511 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4327512 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
4327513 several factors indicate that radio station know should shift its programming from rock and roll music to a continuous news format consider for example the number of older people in our listening area has increased dramatically while the total number of our listeners has recently declined also music stores in our area report decreased sales of recorded music finally continuous news stations in neighboring cities have been very successful and a survey taken just before the recent election shows that local citizens are interested in becoming better informed about politics

4327515 animo dan ekspansi kur dalam kurun waktu singkat menunjukkan betapa besarnya potensi ekonomi masyarakat kita hingga 31 juli 2008 telah direalisasikan kur rp 8 9 triliun dengan jumlah debitor lebih dari 950 ribu orang di seluruh tanah air kur ini diutamakan untuk kredit di bawah rp 5 juta dan tanpa agunan tambahan
4327516 2008 ini adalah tahun yang sulit dan sarat tantangan harga minyak dunia mencapai titik tertinggi dalam sejarah harga pangan di berbagai penjuru dunia melonjak drastis ekonomi dunia terancam resesi
4327517 kenaikan harga minyak dan pangan yang sangat tinggi dengan cepat berdampak melambungnya subsidi energi dan pangan dalam anggaran kita pemerintah akan terus berusaha untuk menekan dampak negatifnya bagi masyarakat
4327518 beban subsidi minyak dan listrik akan naik 3 kali lipat sampai akhir tahun dibanding anggaran subsidi energi pada apbn 2008 dan kita tidak bisa memungkiri bahwa subsdi energi ini lebih banyak dinikmati oleh mereka yang memiliki mobil dan mereka yang memiliki rumah dengan daya listrik yang besar
4327519 oil came down but who knows where it will go next
4327520 its in a bit of a holding pattern at the moment she said
4327521 our soccer team won the gold medal in martial arts
4327522 china has had a weird year with a freak snowstorm the tibetan riots and an earthquake but the performance of our soccer team shows that some things never change
4327523 our strikers did such a great job that i even told them they should start playing for our mens team now
4327524 its so beyond an embarrassment that it almost seems like a comedy
4327525 weve cried our tears dry and now its time for us to enjoy the big show because you never know how our team is going to lose this time
4327526 without rule of law corruption will get involved and nobody is responsible to anyone
4327527 if chinese continue to be obsessed with soccer theyll definitely demand something dramatic something political or involving rule of law it will start with sports and then it will move onto something bigger
4327528 it represents the most outdated management system that still exists in this country
4327529 you cant run a soccer team the same way you train table tennis players which is exactly what theyre doing right now
4327530 they enjoy playing soccer while the chinese view it as a fight
4327531 the chinese people have intense wishes for a strong chinese team but we need more tolerance and time
4327532 like you we also want to improve to make a change
4327533 it is then not surprising that some zimbabweans choose not to listen to cde robert mugabe an ordinary human being who was chosen by people to lead them but what we should know is that leaders are chosen by god as well

4327540 zimbabweans would hurl tomatoes if they didnt cost 3m a throw
4327541 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4327542 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4327543 group leading the fight against the proposition down to the groups very slogan
4327544 i mentioned half jokingly to our builder that we should build a luxury doghouse and it went from there i think people go to these lengths for their pets because they are considered part of the family now
4327545 many of our clients have pets but dont have children so theyre doted upon and treated just as well as kids would be
4327546 you should write a song and hope that youve put all your heart into it and examine things that are hard to examine and approach them with as much dignity as possible but when it comes out its just a song it can be extremely special for someone but its just a song
4327547 you can honestly get stuck in that way of asking questions
4327548 my objective if anything is not to have an objective and just sit and write
4327549 were written in the utmost personal way but i think theyre written in a way that theyre accessing subconscious material in that regard they are extremely personal and remain mysterious to me and still teach me lessons a year and a half later

4327574 we are anticipating within the next year to two years we should have limited access to that beach only
4327575 the intention is to get this moving to meet the time lines for next year
4327576 we did have access to it for many many years
4327577 but then they recently started to enforce the access points
4327578 we cant just do a clearance and say it is okay for recreational use the topography is shifting so much each year
4327579 if you look at the distribution of metallic anomalies out there it is pretty heavily saturated
4327580 there would not be public access if there was a species at risk
4327581 we will make sure people are respecting what is asked of them
4327582 the majority of people just want access to the beach

4327592 although such a move would be a positive improvement to the current arrangement
4327593 what i understand is that mr chaudhry went to his management board first to get them to ask him to pull out of the cabinet but some of them refused because they all hold important positions and they want him to stay so they can stay
4327594 but he cant because he will face a possible forced removal so there was an apparent split which is why he is now going to the nfu dominated national council which he controls absolutely and he is expected to ask them to ask him to pull out of the cabinet and this announcement is expected on monday or late sunday

4327611 were now on their radar screen because theyve filled up everywhere else

4327613 all it takes is a shadow of a wal mart to get people upset
4327614 people want good products at a low price and thats exactly what wal mart produces wal mart consistently delivers
4327615 we conclude that the competitive effect of wal mart supercenter entry on the prices charged by other supermarkets and grocers is 1 percent to 1 2 percent
4327616 we also find that the price effects are concentrated in smaller supermarket and grocery chains

4327637 im just like my mother and i know my father couldnt stand her thats why my husband left
4327638 i have been married 15 years to the most wonderful man he is a great provider a great father and a great friend my husband has been a terrific companion to me for all these years in fact i would say our love has gotten even stronger every day we have been married we get along great and always have a good time together i would say our marriage is perfect in every way except one our love life has gone downhill in the past few years when we were first together the romance was fiery we made passionate love every night sometimes two or three times we were like rabbits we couldnt stand to be together and not make love we had sex in the car on the elevator in the park wherever the mood struck us my husband was so hot and he was such a stud i couldnt keep my hands off of him and i loved his hands on me every time we had sex i came he was just so long and hard he had amazing control so we could do it for hours in those first months i had trouble walking sometimes after all our after dark activity but as he has gotten older his equipment doesnt work as well as it used to his dick doesnt get as hard or stay hard as long as i need it to so i can come i end up leaving each sexual encounter feeling frustrated instead of satisfied i dont think i need to tell you ladies that if things arent coming together in the bedroom it throws everything in the relationship off i want my sexy rock hard husband back i want him to take me in the bedroom like the strong stallion he used to be i am not ready to have the sex life of an old woman married to an old man i am a vibrant healthy woman and i need to have regular orgasms to stay happy you know how men are they get upset if they think there is a problem with their dick they feel like they are less of a man i felt like i had to find a solution for him that wouldnt involve an embarrassing trip to the doctor i mean come on ladies no one has a husband who will willingly go to the doctor to discuss erectile dysfunction this is a problem that needs to be handled delicately i needed a solution to turn my husband back into the stud he once was without embarrassing him or making me go any longer without good sex i had seen some commercials for male supplements but the commercials looked questionable one was pretty funny but it didnt tell me how it worked i really wanted to find something that worked the first time my husband wouldnt be able to deal with trying a bunch of different pills and have nothing work hed start to ask questions about why i was pushing this stuff then wed argue everyone would end up pissed off i was trying to get the lovin going not a fight once i found www mojorisen com i knew i had the answer to my problem they sell a male enhancement supplement to make my husbands dick rock hard again the supplement is safe legal and available without a prescription it also didnt have some of the dangerous herbs the other supplements have while i wanted our sex life i certainly didnt want to make my husband sick also it can be taken with alcohol so if we had a romantic dinner with wine it would still work the mojo risen would be delivered in an unmarked package and had a 100 iron clad money back guarantee i hoped i wouldnt need that guarantee i have to tell you i got a little aroused just thinking of using it i placed my order and anxiously waited for the supplement to arrive fortunately it got here really quickly i greeted my husband at the door after work wearing little more than a smile and holding a glass of champagne i slipped him the supplement and started to kiss him he looked at me questioningly but when i moved his hand to my butt he just went with the flow we fooled around for about 30 minutes and next thing we knew his dick was hard as a rock to show him how thrilled i was i did that thing i only do once it awhile that really got him going we didnt even make it upstairs to the bedroom we had mindblowing sex for hours right in the living room i came over and over again and he was able to come back for more and more and more after we were too exhausted to move my husband asked me what the pill had been i told him it was a supplement from www mojorisen com he was amazed that such a small supplement was strong enough to pack such a punch he said he felt like we were newlyweds the next morning the supplement was still working as i could tell from his rock hard morning wood i surprised him by getting started before he woke up he loved it the next time he took the supplement we had sex like a couple of horny teenagers over and over again all over the house my stallion was back he had no side effects from mojo risen he felt great and we both were so happy it is like we turned back time we got our sex life back without any embarrassing doctor visits or filling embarrassing prescriptions i was able to help my husband without making him feel like he was inadequate as a lover we agreed that we would always have them on hand my sex life is too important to me to miss out on all this hot fun

4327657 iraqi foreign minister hoshyar zebari says iraq is working out a new accord with the us that he hopes will have a timetable for withdrawing its combat troops prime minister nouri al maliki says iraq should be able to do without them by as early as 2010 us president george bush will consider his own plan for troop withdrawals next month and a fortnight ago cut tours of duty in iraq from 15 months to 12 no wonder theyre confident the iraqi army once expert only at running away can now mount operations with minimal us support the once corrupt police force has been reformed more importantly so successful has been the war on al qaida and other terrorist groups that just 13 us soldiers died last month only eight in combat its the lowest monthly death toll since the 2003 invasion
4327658 iraqi police and soldiers lost 80 men which is tragic but also well down although almost 400 iraqi civilians were still killed that too is less than a quarter of the toll of a year ago and well below the average number of people saddam hussein had killed each month of his horrific rule in fact its below the murder rate of anarchic south africa and no one dares ask if liberating south africa was worth the sacrifice but iraq needs more than peace to thrive so heres this weeks other good news high oil prices and better security for its oil fields means iraq will end the year with a 90 billion cumulative budget surplus says the us general accounting office thats a lot of money for building a future for democratic iraq instead of palaces and weapons for the tyrant saddam on the drawing board of the elected iraqi government are plans for 1000 primary healthcare centres new airports and the renovation of downtown baghdad

4327796 well its no pressure for me to be honest because im harder on myself than anybody thats really how i do things
4327797 i set my goals high and the expectations high for myself and i work hard at accomplishing those goals
4327798 coming from southeastern minnesota we dont get the exposure of the big ten schools and i think i had a lot to do with his decision
4327799 he came to me and he said do you think that im able to play and looking at the class i thought that he would come in as a corner originally out of high school he had never played receiver before and he asked me where would i stack up among your corners and i said you could start you could be a great big ten cornerback from what i had seen from what we had coming out of my freshman class i would have put him right up at the top of those guys
4327800 they played him at wide receiver because we had a dire need for wide receivers at the time and he was very athletic hes got the highest vertical on the team and hes one of the faster kids on the team
4327801 within any team theres always going to be some dissenters but its all about who the majority is listening to i think that 99 9 percent of the people have bought into brewsters plan
4327802 it was a combination of learning complex new systems we went from a very simplified offense and defense to a very very complicated offense and defense
4327803 couple that with the fact that we had more young players in certain positions

4327809 this was expected i knew this was going to happen anyway
4327810 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
4327811 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

4327814 i must get married and have a wedding and refuse to listen to sense and wait a year
4327815 wow i have lived half of my life if i am lucky
4327816 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4327817 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4327818 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4327819 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4327820 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4327821 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4327822 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4327823 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4327824 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4327825 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4327826 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4327827 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4327828 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4327829 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4327830 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4327831 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

4327840 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4327841 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4327842 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4327843 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4327844 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4327845 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4327846 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4327847 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4327848 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4327849 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4327850 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4327851 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4327852 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4327853 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4327854 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4327855 who are open to doing something on the production side
4327856 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4327857 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4327858 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4327859 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4327860 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4327861 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4327862 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4327863 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4327864 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4327865 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4327866 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4327867 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4327868 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4327869 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4327870 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4327871 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4327872 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4327873 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4327874 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4327875 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4327876 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4327877 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4327878 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4327879 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4327880 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4327881 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4327882 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4327883 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4327884 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4327885 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4327886 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4327887 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4327888 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4327889 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4327890 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4327891 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4327892 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4327893 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4327894 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4327895 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4327896 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4327897 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4327898 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4327899 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4327900 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4327901 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4327902 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4327903 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4327904 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4327905 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4327906 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4327907 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4327908 no christian churches are allowed the open practice of christianity is punishable by death
4327909 the death of the girl sent shockwaves and websites where the victim used to write with various nicknames have allocated special space to mourn her while some others closed temporarily in protest
4327910 they get what they deserve because my husband didnt deserve to die
4327911 the recent incidents in jammu and kashmir are a cause for concern in this hour of crisis i appeal to all political parties to keep the long term interests of jammu and kashmir in view and come together to find a permanent solution to the problems of the state
4327912 the sacred shrine of shri amarnath inspires all indians to march together
4327913 issues related to this sacred place especially the issue of providing the best possible facilities to pilgrims can only be resolved in an atmosphere of peace and goodwill
4327914 dividing people in the name of religion can complicate these issues further which can also pose a threat to the unity and integrity of the country
4327915 i appeal to the people of jammu and kashmir to cooperate with us in establishing peace in the state it is my conviction that all issues can be resolved only through dialogue and peaceful means
4327916 the recent blasts in our embassy have cast a shadow over our efforts to normalise relations with pakistan and to bring a lasting and honourable peace in our region i have personally conveyed my concern and disappointment to the government of pakistan

4327927 we need to talk about what happened in the engagement party we definitely will have a conversation about that
4327928 its all this christian thing because all sins are absolved they are never taken seriously and no apology is expected
4327929 you know im getting tired of this shit every night
4327930 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity
4327931 as the commission finds are necessary to diminish eliminate or prevent such burden
4327932 you want people to think well of you dont you
4327933 it was not as fast as i wanted to go but that is down to a lack of hurdles races really

4327940 we were working with animation and we wanted to really utilize the format that meant shifting our thinking a bit its a whole different way of telling stories and it gives us the freedom to do things that just arent possible in live action
4327941 ive been dreaming about star wars since i was a kid playing with the toys in the backyard with my brother
4327942 actually working on a star wars movie is beyond anything i could have imagined its great to work in this world that i love so much and to do it with george lucas coming from a fan perspective i also realize how important it is to do it right
4327943 theres one thing we knew we had to deliver above all else a star wars movie
4327944 the characters are distinctly stylized while their environments come to life in a much more realistic way very much creating the kind of immersive worlds people expect to see in a star wars movie

4327954 how we spend our days is of course how we spend our lives
4327955 the recent incidents in the state of jammu and kashmir are a cause for concern
4327956 the nuclear agreement that we are negotiating with developed countries will end indias nuclear isolation it will open up new opportunities for trade in dual use technologies opening up new pathways to accelerate industrialisation of our country
4327957 it the agreement will enable us to provide electricity to meet the needs of our farmers our artisans our traders and our industry

4327962 it is this kind of agreement not the split between russia and united states over the problem of south ossetia that may have a greater impact on the growth in tensions in russian american relations

4327977 sesungguhnya allah menyusun syahwat ini pada diri semua manusia lalu menjadikannya sesuatu yang mengagumkan rahasianya jika engkau meletakkan pada tempatnya dan engkau taku kepada allah engkau akan tenang dan merasa damai engkau adakan mendapati dengan ketenangan itu kesehatan di dunia dan surga di akhirat tetapi jika engkau lepaskan ia dan tidak engkau kekang dengan tali syariah dan ahlak syahwat itu akan selalu bergolak laksana api setiap kali engkau tambahkan kayu kering ia akan semakin memakan kayu itu lalu dengan itu engkau seperti orang yang mencari air di fatamorgana engkau akan terus kehausan semakin engkau cari ia semakin bertambah rasa hausmu dan fatamorgana itu kian jauh darimu

4328014 i was more nervous than i have ever been ahead of the heat and was disappointed with the way i swam but in my heart of hearts i knew i wasnt capable of winning a medal
4328015 in the warm up i felt awful in the sprints i felt ok but back in there i was just awful
4328016 it was a wonderful honour to carry the flag at the opening ceremony it was possibly the olympic medal for me ive always missed but ive been waiting to get out there and race
4328017 jemma doesnt want to know her results until she gets back from the olympics ive been told to go and pick up her results from school but not to open the envelope
4328018 you know i know it rained the first day but quite honestly i dont understand why we play such a big tournament over 10 days
4328019 according to the investigation the van was at fault and violated traffic rules
4328020 there were a lot of people talking bad about us about how the training camp was a disaster and the high performance programme was no good and theres too much training being done its all a load of rubbish
4328021 ill go back to the team now with another win theres a load of lads into the last eight or the last 16 and things are definitely on the up there is pressure on me to get a medal now but i will just treat it as another fight
4328022 the fortune teller told me if you change your name you will win the gold
4328023 the points didnt go for me today in the last round i knew i wouldnt get the decision unless i knocked him out the scoring here is so bad for an olympic games its unbelievable
4328024 the two presidents agreed on the resumption of the work of the joint committee to define and draw the syrian lebanese borders
4328025 the definition of the shebaa farms cannot happen under occupation
4328026 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4328027 given the situation concerning the illegal detention of a belarussian minor on the territory of the united states belarus proposes an agreement be concluded on conditions for such visits

4328029 the people who need visas are all now in baku and we expect the foreign office will complete the paperwork first thing on friday morning so we are very optimistic the game will go ahead
4328030 we are in regular contact with both member associations concerned for that match in swansea
4328031 if we were picking in the upper middle of the lottery im talking about picks 3 4 5 i would be looking at this guy
4328032 only now they are beginning to show some pictures of the destruction
4328033 shame on you mr gorbachev for perpetuating the very regime you helped to defeat and you fought against as the head of the soviet union
4328034 it is believed that both cases were mischief and no explosives or harmful elements were identified in both objects
4328035 police condemn this kind of act that causes unnecessary panic to the public and appeal to the members of the public not to challenge the rule of law
4328036 some of the pictures on their signs were graphic and disturbing
4328037 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
4328038 im very sorry i know theres nothing i can do to bring him back but if i could i would
4328039 im as sorry as one person can be and i havent forgiven myself since it happened
4328040 no matter what its not bringing michael back but if it eases their conscience then just let it go as it goes
4328041 we know we struggled the past four five years in run defense even before i got here
4328042 we have a weak spot that we need to get going
4328043 i love the matchup of a very physical team not a team that tries to trick you they come right at you so im really glad
4328044 its the perfect opponent that we can have right now
4328045 run defense is all about being in the right place at the right time doing your job
4328046 i think were doing a lot better against the run
4328047 were probably more physical we like the challenge as a group
4328048 especially with the secondary we have we want to make them pass the ball
4328049 stop the run on first down get them into second or third and long and well be fine
4328050 anybody want to talk about the pick and roll now
4328051 we watched the game video of 2006 this morning we watched it yesterday pretty much every time we watched the scouting report
4328052 any time you get beat its embarrassing thats enough and we really used that to help us
4328053 this isnt the game that weve been pointing to in the whole olympics
4328054 weve got five more games to win and were here for the gold medal but did we think about it being greece and what happened the last time of course we did
4328055 it will be good to go down and see his old friends and family
4328056 at no time did i say that we would have one guy for one game and one the next i said we wouldnt discuss the specifics because i didnt know what they were going to be
4328057 were talking about what gives us the best opportunity to win im still encouraged by all three quarterbacks whats fair is fair to the team
4328058 id prefer different circumstances but ive just got to make the most of it
4328059 that you can be consistent and make the improvements on what happened in the last game and show how youre growing each day in practice
4328060 its a little unique any time i play an nfc north team because i know a lot of the guys personally
4328061 matt and robby took care of me and told me how to conduct myself as a professional i was fortunate to have those guys take a liking to me
4328062 its a weird situation because there are so many of them
4328063 some have done well and some havent and thats what youll see at times theyll be overmatched its not easy because its hard to judge talent at the big league level theres been a pretty big turnover of guys who could maybe play here they have to realize this is their opportunity to show what they can do
4328064 itd cost the giants a lot more than 7 5 million to get a catcher on the free agent market so its in their best interest to make sure they sign buster
4328065 a couple of hundred bus drivers were in danger of losing their jobs
4328066 those who participated saw their blood pressure drop by an average of 20 points
4328067 we probably saved the jobs of a couple of hundred people
4328068 people dont want to walk outside in florida because of the heat
4328069 and a lot of employers are certainly turning to wellness programs in hopes of cutting costs
4328070 i think that was the same infield i remember for a game in spring training
4328071 he didnt really know what my pattern is its going to take awhile
4328072 he did fine can you imagine up from double a
4328073 it aint easy you learn the hard way in this game its a lot on a kids mind itll be an interesting month and a half
4328074 its the hardest part of the game to swallow when you make your pitch and dont get the guy out
4328075 its frustrating especially because all our games are going to be close typically we dont blow guys out so those little balls that get through like that it just gets frustrating
4328076 he threw one down the middle its not what you expect in that situation the guy berkman is a great hitter he shouldnt get a pitch like that but he did
4328077 yeah little tad i was the guy they couldnt touch until that lousy thursday and that no good bum upton
4328078 i think when i have grandkids all the games will be on video and theyll be able to see it for themselves
4328079 theyll see it was a line drive off the wall
4328080 i was in the bullpen and i wasnt having any trouble at all keeping the ball down
4328081 but the oakland seventh was a long inning they the rays had made a pitching change and somewhere between the bullpen and the mound i lost my release point
4328082 i thought that was going to hit off the wall
4328083 that one i thought was out i thought it was going to hit off the top of the scoreboard
4328084 i could have gone scoreless the whole year long and not won the cy young award
4328085 as long as im not remembered just for those first 39 innings ill be ok with that
4328086 through no fault of his that legal representation was not there
4328087 just be careful about those credit cards all right dont eat out as much
4328088 the democratization of credit has really generated a competitive spending culture and plastic has allowed for material goods not had in the previous generation says bob manning author of credit card nation most of us grew up in a home with just one or two bathrooms for the whole family he points out today new homes usually have at least one bathroom per bedroom that change has happened so fast manning says this generation feels that somehow or another theyre going to figure out some technological advancement thats going to get them out of their financial troubles and outsmart the market says manning who served as adviser to the documentary in debt we trust the documentary paints a picture of national financial crisis stemming from the personal debt burden
4328089 when the federal reserve asked for comments on its proposed rules on abusive credit card practices an astonishing 56 000 poured in most were from outraged consumers they told of interest rates skyrocketing when they paid an unrelated bill late they complained of unwarranted late fees and pushed up due dates one pennsylvania customer fumed im fed up with credit card company tricks that drive us deeper in debt this anguished deluge should send a clear message to leaders in washington the federal reserve should swiftly adopt its proposed rules against unfair or deceptive credit card practices but the real burden to curb these abuses falls on congress
4328090 washington reuters legislation aimed at curbing credit card billing practices that surprise borrowers with unexpected interest rate increases and fees was approved on thursday by a u s house of representatives committee the bill approved by financial services committee mirrors federal reserve proposals that would effectively end double cycle billing in which card companies reach back to prior billing cycles to help calculate the interest charged in the current cycle
4328091 as the american blessing of credit cards became widespread so did the american curse of debt
4328092 we need to understand that steve bracks made his recommendations prior to the collapse of doha round of world trade talks national secretary dave oliver said
4328093 it makes no sense at all given doha the collapse of world trade talks the global financial crisis and the issue of climate change to consider reducing tariffs
4328094 china india malaysia are not doing it and neither are canada and the european union
4328095 i want to make sure that if and when we do it its really good its perfect
4328096 itll be very limited i want to make sure and im not quite certain yet but we should have answers very shortly
4328097 weve spent a lot of time doing a lot of wiring of ballparks doing a lot of checking
4328098 this is what weve been looking forward to weve been talking about this day its pretty neat
4328099 it is something that i am going to have to get used to basically getting my feet into the shape where they can tolerate it
4328100 i think it should be successful i did everything he asked me to do
4328101 id love to say we expected this or planned this
4328102 i knew obviously tashas game i knew shay to a degree but i was very impressed with what i saw in practice today
4328103 i saw with tasha humphrey a tenacity there i didnt realize she had
4328104 shes a monster in the paint i knew she could face up and knock down shots but she was just a beast in the paint just her positioning inside
4328105 when i look at her game i think of charles barkley
4328106 she can go inside she can go outside shes an undersized power forward she can handle the ball she can rebound the thing ive yet to see that i dont know if she can do is defend im waiting to see that out of her
4328107 they have good post players here as we did in detroit this league is competitive you have to come out and compete
4328108 its hard when you come in and meet a team and you dont have any practices
4328109 but notes that notwithstanding this agreement violence continues with civilians bearing the brunt
4328110 to respect and protect civilians in accordance with international humanitarian law and human rights law
4328111 georgian cities remain subject to the hostile and aggressive behavior of russia
4328112 they have like 15 tanks and a number of armored personnel carriers ready to be boarded by anybody else and driven in any direction and huge stockpiles of ammunition
4328113 im not familiar with the situation and ive not heard any complaints from the united nations
4328114 have begun providing relief supplies to tens of thousands of affected persons in those areas of the country that are accessible
4328115 however large parts of the conflict affected area particularly south ossetia and the gori region remain for the most part inaccessible to humanitarian organizations due to ongoing insecurity lawlessness and other constraints
4328116 international discussions on the modalities of lasting security in abkhazia and south ossetia
4328117 it calls for fair play and honesty all the time
4328118 these moments of fair play they seem like small common things but they arent small and they arent common
4328119 fair play trophies and diplomas awarded by ifpc from 1964 2005
4328120 we dont get more nominations even now that its all on tv and you can watch everything over and over
4328121 victory is a huge motivation a great number of people make money off athletes sports federations commercial sponsors everyone pressures them to get to the top athletes live under threat
4328122 i think i deserved a bronze i dont think it was fair
4328123 there must be fair play moments all the time all over the world
4328124 itll depend on where she is now how important the case is how much it would cost the taxpayers and whether witnesses are still around
4328125 she was a rather bizarre character and seems to have a strange circumstance now
4328126 there was a strong aroma about her and i told her this needed to be taken care of before i went to court with her
4328127 weve corrected quite a bit on oil despite a lot of bullish news the sentiment has been bearish
4328128 there is no doubt this was orchestrated by the abramson and beshear administrations and is another example of mayor abramson going over the heads of the voters so that he can place his cronies into office
4328129 when given the option of either allowing the people to choose or making decisions behind close doors jerry always goes with his own self interest and of course given his recent track record in staffing important positions the citizens of metro louisville can be assured the next county attorney will enjoy at least a kimberly bunton like success
4328130 mayor abramson could have pushed for this appointment to be made so that the people could have their say
4328131 but jerry would rather add the county attorneys office to his list of metro government puppets the bottom line is that when it comes to the democratic process mayor abramson is anti choice
4328132 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4328133 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4328134 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4328135 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4328136 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4328137 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4328138 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4328139 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4328140 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach
4328141 ottawa has a strong agricultural history that many people are aware of but they may not be aware of the extent of the farming that took place in what are now urban areas we thought that one of the best ways to convey this idea was to feed people the foods similar to what the billings themselves would have grown and eaten
4328142 those are things were investigating right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4328143 it is the senators goal each and every season to provide our fans with many affordable ticketing opportunities so that as many fans as possible are able to attend our games
4328144 variable pricing and the support of our partners last season allowed us to provide more than 215 000 affordably priced tickets to our fans we will strive in the current season to meet and exceed this number
4328145 i have always said ottawa is a leader in e technology and i am pleased that staff are continuously finding ways to use technology to better serve residents and enterprise
4328146 its clear from web metrics and feedback that the citys e media and it staff are getting it right the gtec distinction awards nominations are affirmation from our peers in all three levels of government
4328147 in 2007 the citys website received more than 5 3 million visits up from nearly 5 million visits in 2006 well timed and accurate information has become a key enabler for the public and businesses to get the right information when they need it whether it is to register online for recreation programs find out about the next flu clinic or participate in an online public consultation
4328148 our goal today was to highlight our technological achievements and our plans to maintain a leadership role in information technology we are confident that our strategic plans and vision are well aligned with the priorities identified in the report of the mayors task force on e government

4328150 through this program we will help a number of ottawa families experience the pride of owning their own home
4328151 by launching the homeownership down payment assistance program the city of ottawa is addressing the housing affordability gap for over 200 households in ottawa
4328152 opening up the opportunity for affordable home ownership to middle income households is an important part of an effective housing system that meets the needs of the community
4328153 our city is committed to being a place where families have opportunities to establish roots and prosper
4328154 ahp will allow us to help make the dream of homeownership a reality for ottawa families who otherwise may have difficulty achieving this goal
4328155 the senators organization is excited to establish a formal relationship with elmira
4328156 this agreement enables our organization the flexibility to move players between the echl and the ahl which we feel will enable us to promote the development of the prospects in our system
4328157 the ottawa police service invites ottawa residents to join the celebrations of capital pride festival
4328158 the yankees drafted cole for a reason we didnt draft him not to sign him
4328159 the road has dropped about a metre which will take our contractors considerable time to repair
4328160 10 40 blockade violation arrests happening at 4th av and 5th st please keep a safe distance please hold parade in waiting mode for 20 minutes
4328161 11 40 reports of dehydration check around water and treatment available at corners of 1st 5th and 7th and in front of capital white tent red cross
4328162 oil came down but who knows where it will go next
4328163 its in a bit of a holding pattern at the moment she said
4328164 when he settles in when there are runners on base he executes pitches
4328165 he gets comfortable gets in his delivery and gets in the flow of the game and really pitches well
4328166 we got all those runs near the beginning of the game so i should have been able to go out there and get outs at a better pace but i wasnt able to
4328167 i felt like i was struggling to get into a good groove all game
4328168 of course youre embarrassed were all embarrassed because we feel were better than that
4328169 our bullpen definitely didnt need to be in there for nine innings i wish i would have done better
4328170 we were pleased with the waca reaction that the new playing dates offer local fans including corporate groups wanting to entertain at the cricket good dates for a pre christmas test match
4328171 like death jr hot shots golf frogger an unidentified beachball game a tales game from namco ape escape armored core syphon filter spider man medievil dynasty warriors gran turismo ridge racer tony hawk darkstalkers wild arms and metal gear solid
4328172 that was pretty much a drubbing really and thats not a true reflection of the two sides i think were a better side than that
4328173 whoever youre playing for its always disappointed to get beaten like that when you know you should have done better because you walk off the field thinking we mucked up today and it should have been a lot tighter than that
4328174 were probably more used to that sort of pitch than those guys are it was a little damp in the morning but even so we should have been a little bit smarter with bat and ball
4328175 where is that rocket propelled grenade launcher when you need one
4328176 unitarian universalism is a caring open minded religion that encourages you to seek your own spiritual path our faith draws on many religious traditions welcoming people with different beliefs we are united by shared values not by creed or dogma our congregations are places where people gather to nurture their spirits and put their faith into action by helping to make our communities and the world a better place
4328177 i understand its under control were just waiting for a further report
4328178 doesnt care who sang the song as long as she performed
4328179 i dont care about this either the only thing i care about is that my daughter will not get hurt by this shell understand when she grows up
4328180 its not about faster higher stronger women in sports are promoted as sexualised bodies for ogling men are promoted as performers
4328181 maybe this means that olympic officials have to learn to live with ambiguity and make peace with a world in which things are not always quantifiable and clear
4328182 our country simply cannot afford to have insecure supply of electricity
4328183 we dont think banning new thermal baseload is necessary to encourage investment in renewables it is happening already one major generator with approval to build a combined cycle gas plant has shelved that in favour of massive investment in geothermal and wind power
4328184 we say trust the market a price on carbon will do the job of encouraging renewables
4328185 without these details todays announcement is simply a mandate for heavier reliance on coal and gas which is not the way of the future
4328186 half the money i spend on advertising is wasted the trouble is i dont know which half
4328187 i am looking for research iams has done regarding benefits of breeding every heat in dogs
4328188 thank you for taking the time to write i wish i could assist you with your inquiry however this is not really our area of expertise
4328189 los latinos sienten la m sica de una manera muy especial
4328190 some of the dogs are just not that happy standing on a grooming table with a strange noisy object shoved in front of their face the camera click buzz whir how many of you like your photo taken
4328191 with the females a year or two ago we would have answered that with once a year iams has done a study over the past several years with over 7000 females and 17 500 litters that shows that breeding every heat cycle on average females cycle every 6 10 months is far healthier for the female dog and the puppies too
4328192 remember the pups have had their eyes open for only a few weeks my comment generally a puppys eyes open when they are about 2 weeks old give or take a day or two at 8 weeks a puppys eyes have been open for 1 1 2 months the muscles around the eyes are still weak so its common for one or both eyes to stray to the side for a few more weeks yet shih tzu and pekingese and their mixes have the weakest eyes as puppies because they have a rounder skull
4328193 hey honey maybe we should take him for a walk tomorrow maybe teach him to sit
4328194 simply set a variety of dog safe but not necessarily dog loved foods on paper plates
4328195 this is lots of fun and everybody goes home with something to stick up on their fridge
4328196 only to have the birthday cake thrown in the trash by the campaign
4328197 obama sleeps with a teddy bear and a night light
4328198 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4328199 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4328200 so lets talk about what were going to talk about
4328201 what do you mean what are we going to talk about youre nuts
4328202 a piece of scholarship and a good one at that
4328203 a piece of scholarship and a good one at that
4328204 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
4328205 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
4328206 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4328207 los pueblos originarios no fueron incluidos en la discusi n de la lge
4328208 tratamos de producir obras de denuncia claras y provocadoras que hagan reaccionar a la prensa y suscitar esfuerzos de destruccion de la obra por parte de aquellos que no puedan soportarla haciendo mucho ruido y volviendo accesible el mensaje a los que no pertenecen al campo
4328209 hice abundante cosecha de esqueletos y craneos en los cementerios de los indigenas sometidos que vivian en las inmediaciones del azul y en blanca grande
4328210 umbral de un verdadero golpe de estado contra el orden constitucional
4328211 al t pico estilo de las dictaduras que precedieron a la recuperaci n de la democracia en 1982
4328212 toman aeropuertos toman cortes departamentales electorales y balean carros coches de ministros
4328213 las fuerzas armadas son los garantes de la democracia concepto que incluye el precepto constitucional de garantizar la estabilidad del gobierno legalmente constituido sea el actual o cualquier otro que recoja la voluntad del pueblo que es el gran soberano
4328214 los resultados del proceso cualquiera que estos fueran con la mayor cordura y sentido de responsabilidad
4328215 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4328216 el fiscal de la forestal mininco ha estado amedrentando a las comunidades mapuche de chequenco y antinao oblig ndoles a declarar en contra de nosotros que actualmente nos encontramos recluidos en la c rcel de temuco y de angol a muchos mapuche de la comunidad se les est ofreciendo dinero y artefactos como celulares para que declaren y esp en a su propia gente
4328217 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4328218 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4328219 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4328220 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
4328221 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
4328222 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
4328223 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
4328224 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
4328225 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
4328226 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
4328227 we choose to go not because it is easy but because it is hard because that goal will serve to measure and organize the best of our energies and skills because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept one we are unwilling to postpone and one which we intend to win
4328228 so goes san francisco so goes california and so goes the nation
4328229 call it what it is its a power takeover of pg amp e
4328230 all we are asking is a feasibility study its our figures against their figures so why wont they at least commit to a feasibility study
4328231 a ver el lugar de reposo de mat as catrileo el fue mi hermano mi amigo que me acompa en los d as de prisi n fui a rendirle homenaje
4328232 porque yo no ten a factura para comprobar que los 180 000 que se robaron eran m os
4328233 yo siento mucho sufrimiento estos a os que el hijo est preso son un dolor muy grande la comida no la puedo aprovechar la como entre l grimas a ra z de este problema de los que llevan la justicia me he enfermado tuvieron que llevarme al hospital espero que dejen en libertad a mi hijo y me lo entreguen en buenas condiciones como estaba l al ser detenido

4328236 in short his record of attacks is disgusting and false and so is this book
4328237 nowhere in the autobiography does obama disclose that his wife to be accompanied him to africa on the 1992 trip
4328238 after our engagement i took michelle to kenya to meet the other half of my family she was an immediate success there as well in part because the number of luo words in her vocabulary very soon surpassed mine
4328239 we had a fine time in alego helping auma on a film project of hers listening to more of grannys stories meeting relatives id missed the first time around
4328240 obama failed to discuss his fathers alcoholism and polygamy in his autobiography
4328241 he would come home very late drunk and i could hear him shouting at ruth telling her to cook him food then he would stagger in drunk and come into my room and wake me because he wanted company or something to eat he would talk about how unhappy he was and how he had been betrayed
4328242 it is to my family though my mother my grandparents my siblings stretched across oceans and continents that i owe the deepest gratitude and to whom i dedicated this book without their constant love and support without their willingness to let me sing their song and their toleration of the occasional wrong note i could never have hoped to finish if nothing else i hope that the love and respect i feel for them shines through on every page
4328243 any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11

4328255 todav a no se ha hecho la devoluci n pedida de las cintas y del respeto al derecho del secreto de las fuentes eso independiente que la ley no lo consigne porque esto no significa que no sea leg timo se ha pedido al ministerio de interior por medio de su subsecretario felipe harboe y a trav s de la ministra de cultura paulina urrutia pero la verdad estamos a la espera de una conferencia de prensa del ministerio de cultura la que todav a no se da

4328261 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4328262 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4328263 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4328264 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4328265 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4328266 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4328267 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4328268 el objetivo de la cumbre de mujeres es encontrarnos para intercambiar los an lisis de las realidades de nuestros pa ses y a partir de ah hacer incidencia en todos los espacios y tambi n trabajar para que las mujeres ejerzan sus derechos con la m s amplia participaci n

4328270 todas somos coordinadoras cada una de nosotras desde su organizaci n nacional no necesitamos formar una nueva instancia organizativa para la cumbre de mujeres
4328271 estamos preparando la cumbre de mujeres ind genas con la m s amplia participaci n para plasmar de manera conjunta la dif cil situaci n de los pueblos ind genas del continente y construir propuestas no solo para las mujeres sino para todos desde una mirada de mujer
4328272 llevar tiempo y esfuerzo para recuperar la capacidad de los peque os agricultores y no parece que haya ning n deseo pol tico para esto sin olvidar el hecho que nafta debe ser renegociada
4328273 in til buscar un programa de recuperaci n que sea consistente con el pago de la deuda fijada por nuestros acreedores
4328274 nuestros peque os productores agr colas son masacrados por la brutal injusticia del entorno del comercio internacional
4328275 en la globalizaci n el campesino o campesina pierde su identidad social cultural y econ mica de productor ahora un campesino es consumidor de semillas y qu micos caros que venden las poderosas corporaciones trasnacionales por medio de poderosos latifundistas y prestamistas locales
4328276 a menudo lo han hecho en unos t rminos muy desfavorables para los granjeros pobres dejando a estos con m s inseguridad alimentaria y a los gobiernos a depender de unas ayudas internacionales poco predecibles
4328277 muchas de las empresas privadas que vinieron a reemplazar a los investigadores estatales resultaron ser monopolistas en busca de dinero
4328278 no pensamos que el coste humano de esos programas seria tan grande y que las ganancias econ micas tardasen tanto en llegar
4328279 el sector paraestatal continuar a siendo un riesgo para la exitosa implementaci n del presupuesto de 2002 03 las intervenciones del gobierno en la agricultura y otros mercados alimentarios est n socavando otras inversiones m s productivas
4328280 had a great ride the weathers been good and teams been taking it real good no sores no shoes no wheel breakage
4328281 ive been on five and six day rides done quite a few of them but i didnt think itd be this big this long i thought wed have maybe more trouble more lame horses something like that
4328282 it really gives you lots of thoughts on how these old pioneers made it through this territory they really had to have had some hardships and it really gets us closer to those roots
4328283 get back to a schedule now were used to a schedule and i dont think ive been away from home this long ever so itll be nice to get back into a routine again
4328284 theyre just having fun meeting the other kids trading pins playing in the game room meeting the other countries right now i cant believe how loose they are
4328285 the pitching here will be a lot tougher weve been trying to explain that to the guys
4328286 were not going to be able to hit the same way we did in indy i mean we had a 450 or 500 batting average up there i dont think thatll happen here but we just hope to make contact put the ball in play let our defense do the work and see what happens
4328287 we played on it at indy and we got to be in front of the cameras we got to have those two minute three minute delays before we can get out of the dugout and sit there and think about it im hoping that helped us and that will get us ready
4328288 on the road for two and a half weeks so i mean we really havent had much time to think about it that much so i think once we get home relax i think itll really hit us
4328289 i havent done any tours this will be my first bike tour but its not a race
4328290 a friend of mine told me you leave your loved ones at home to go work with your family so thats kind of what its about
4328291 im sure itll be real emotional and surreal at the same time being there for the memorial on the 11th of september will be exciting and emotional kind of get goose bumps talking about it itll be awfully special probably be the highlight of my career im sure
4328292 take it slowly methodically the hard ones are just combinations of the simpler ones
4328293 i thought the game would help kill a couple of minutes but an hour later im still playing great game hopefully ill be able to beat this game eventually
4328294 awesome great time waster and fun i will send it off to my friends
4328295 its been two weeks and so i called and they said oh we never put the order in
4328296 it felt good to write that trip advisory report on how horrible it was and get that out and be done with that
4328297 total zero customer service we werent very happy with that and wrote in a complaint to their headquarters and received two letters of apology
4328298 you definitely dont want to over react you want to realize its in the businesses long term interests to resolve the complaint to have good customer service because people talk
4328299 we share that with the business give them a certain amount of time to respond and give it back to consumer and hopefully we come to some mutual agreeable solution to the dispute
4328300 the consumer is not always right and the business is not always right we come at it from that approach we try to be unbiased and reconcile the two disputing parties
4328301 i paid for the service plan shouldnt you be entitled to something
4328302 i think its a big future for us there are so many different avenues that can go off from verasun as the biodiesels and etcetera that comes from it were looking forward to seeing this thing come off the ground
4328303 right now were hoping that we see more people move to to our community we have housing available and that it will be a big plus for hartley and the surrounding areas
4328304 we noticed it a lot in the convenience stores the grocery store obviously the bars the night club that was in town it was just busy
4328305 for about the year and a half they were working out there it was really beneficial we had the opportunity to go out there three days a week and serve the guys meals that were doing the construction
4328306 we anticipate that itll be pretty soon when they get started theyll be vendors coming back to help with the project to make sure all the little un noticeable things are fixed up and so they can run smooth
4328307 whenever they start flipping switches were going to see trucks going down the road again were just patiently waiting
4328308 sort of thats the way everything goes youre not guaranteed for everything its just the way things go
4328309 qu epitafio escribir a un poeta de ti caminante aqu yace un ni o a quien los griegos mataron por miedo
4328310 we can know virtually nothing of certainty about the ancient druids so that although they certainly existed they function more or less as legendary figures
4328311 is that the soul does not die and that after death it passes from one body into another
4328312 the pythagorean doctrine prevails among the gauls teaching that the souls of men are immortal and that after a fixed number of years they will enter into another body
4328313 with regard to their actual course of studies the main object of all education is in their opinion to imbue their scholars with a firm belief in the indestructability of the human soul which according to their belief merely passes at death from one tenement to another for by such doctrine alone they say which robs death of all its terrors can the highest form of human courage be developed subsidiary to the teachings of this main principle they hold various lectures and discussions on astronomy on the extent and geographical distribution of the globe on the different branches of natural philosophy and on many problems connected with religion
4328314 these men predict the future by observing the flight and calls of birds and by the sacrifice of holy animals all orders of society are in their power and in very important matters they prepare a human victim plunging a dagger into his chest by observing the way his limbs convulse as he falls and the gushing of his blood they are able to read the future
4328315 terrified our soldiers who had never seen such a thing before
4328316 deemed it indeed a duty to cover their altars with the blood of captives and to consult their deities through human entrails
4328317 is no evidence that tacitus ever used eye witness reports
4328318 individual druids let alone druid princes are unlikely to be identified archaeologically
4328319 upon this the miserable creatures might have been seen at first to become stiff like rocks next as they endeavored with every possible effort to move forward but were not able to take a step farther they began to whirl themselves about in the most ridiculous fashion until not able any longer to sustain the weight they set down the dead body
4328320 a prodigious amount of rubbish has been written about druidism
4328321 at the end of the world druidic and other revitalization movements in post conquest gaul and britain
4328322 rather as a colonial administrator sixty or seventy years ago might have recorded a few of the more startling facts about the witch doctors or medicine men he had heard of or encountered on africa or the orient
4328323 few historians now believe that that the druids as a corporation constituted an effective anti roman element during the period of caesars conquests and in the period of early posidonius on which caesar and other writers seem to have depended is lost see daphne nash
4328324 visions of power imagery and symbols in late iron age britain
4328325 at the end of the world druidic and other revitalization movements in post conquest gaul and britain
4328326 night and day the symbolism of astral signs on late iron age anthropomorphic short swords
4328327 every time we see a patient that was delayed we always agonize a little bit
4328328 we do see a lot of people in the er and it turns out not to be a heart attack
4328329 but if you are having the big one you want to figure it out right away
4328330 chest pain is not something you triage over the phone

4328335 nick was backstage after a show and the doors just burst open and they like 30 girls just rushed him and were grabbing him and hugging him we were freaking out we didnt know what to do we had no security
4328336 i want fans to give me advice on girls why do they always say they dont look good in pictures even though they look great
4328337 our new goal is to make sure everyone doesnt think new jersey is the armpit of america its the muscle of america alright thats kind of lame
4328338 i was dating this girl and oh my god it was the worst i kissed her and she had a hairy lip i didnt say anything to her but it was like just go wax or something it was terrible
4328339 maybe well be like ludacris and pop out an album every year on the same date no matter what it is
4328340 when i was little my dad was trying to teach me how to pump gas we were on the road traveling and i put the nozzle down a little bit and the spray got in my eyes i freaked out and ran screaming to the bathroom in the gas station i remember i was knocking things over it was embarrassing
4328341 no matter what i did i never took off my jean jacket ever ever never
4328342 i love to start the morning with actually watching the music videos im a little addicted to them
4328343 when joseph and nicholas tell me what to do that freaks me out
4328344 i watched gilligans island and jurassic park on the same day and that night i had a dream about a t rex eating gilligan i mustve eaten bad food or something
4328345 girls who have a strong belief system are beautiful in a great way
4328346 its a little weird to have fans see pictures of us when we were little because its like whered you get that picture
4328347 my secret is i cannot go to bed i cannot sleep if my bed is not made before i go to bed i can leave it unmade in the morning but i have to remake it before i get into it to sleep
4328348 hold on joe let everyone get their cameras and stuff since you know this is going on youtube
4328349 i told a teacher that the house he just bought that the realtor called and said that his roof collapsed he called the number that i gave him which was actually my cell phone and i told him april fools and he freaked
4328350 one time a girl sprayed a can of silly string
4328351 youll be looking at magazines at an airport and youll see a girl like holding up a magazine and your face is like on the page and youre like okay im just walking away now its a little strange
4328352 you wouldnt know it by looking but i had no teeth in first grade
4328353 nicholas cant have other people wearing his socks if you put on his socks hell get upset and its really funny
4328354 i once had a girlfriend who would send back the notes i had written her with all my spelling errors circled i would get so upset i didnt want to look like an idiot
4328355 he has sweet hair he has a comb over going on then joe tries touching it and stitch pushes his hand away
4328356 so like 5 of the population just died thats cool
4328357 i got one move one move its gold its gold its perfect

4328361 could it be possible that i can love god more intensely as a result of all my earthly desires
4328362 the attack looked very realistic the graphics were well done
4328363 more preemptive by saying what apple was going to do
4328364 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4328365 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4328366 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4328367 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4328368 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4328369 what defenses does georgia have because of the cease fire agreement which russia has not honored georgian troops are being moved to organize a defensive line 10 kilometers six miles away from tbilisi
4328370 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4328371 an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
4328372 ergonomic requirements for office work with visual display terminals vdts part 5 workstation layout and postural requirements
4328373 it seemed to me that work done in the house was endless dreary and peculiarly depressing work work done outdoors and in my fathers service was ritualistically important
4328374 that is okay that your not very good with myspace i check your blog almost everyday so even if you dont know what is going on with me i always know what youre doing hahaha
4328375 oh man its so gross that you have to laugh
4328376 the u s says these elections are essential to get iraqis who have taken risks and stopped fighting into the political system
4328377 well what happens if the political system is rigged against those people i think some of those people might return to violence
4328378 the governing parties have lost their popular base and they dont want these elections because theyre going to lose
4328379 if there is any fraud in the next elections iraq will be a mess again
4328380 this time we will use force to take control of things

4328603 das h tt ich nie gedacht dass es so etwas gibt gab es wirklich prinzessinnen die sich einer frauen harem hielten
4328604 ihr seht also dass es auch schon in fr heren zeiten m chtige frauen gab vor allem d rft ihr nicht vergessen dass die lesbische liebe im orient nie so verdr ngt wurde wie im westen die z rtlichkeiten zwischen frauen waren vor allem im harem immer akzeptiert und bekannt und es ist doch auch etwa sehr sch nes sthetisches und erotisches
4328605 gerne doch und da hab ich noch was anderes f r euch etwas von dem ihr wahrscheinlich gar nicht wisst dass es das in m nchen gibt ein hamam club es ist ein herrlich nachgebautes orientalisches hamam mit allen b dern dampfb dern massage und ruher umen garten und winterg rten zimmersuiten in orientalischem stil dazu eine marokkanische teestube ein t rkisches cafe arabisches restaurant und t rkisches restaurant und noch vieles andere
4328606 darf man das auch so besuchen das w rde ich irre gern einmal
4328607 besuchen kann man nur die gastrononmie der rest ist clubmitgliedern vorbehalten

4328609 das muss ja ein einmaliges erlebnis sein ich w rde alles tun um so was auch einmal erleben zu d rfen
4328610 das mit den orientalischen frau stimmt schon damit sind aber nur die edelfrauen gemeint die gebieterinnen und eine jede edelfrau bringt nat rlich auch zumindest eine pers nliche dienerin oder sklavin mit sonst w re das bei so einem traditionellen fest ja nicht sehr standesgem oder und der anhang k nnte nat rlich auch eine nordische christliche dienerin sein ihr beiden k nntet also meine haremsdamen sein wenn ihr wollt mit richtigen orientalischen kleidern ihr d rft berall hin herrliches essen ein einmaliges erlebnis f r ein wochenende
4328611 wenn das wirklich ginge das klingt ja super also ich w rde sofort ihre dienerin spielen das w re mir eine gro e gro e ehre

4328620 naja eigentlich m ssten wir ja aber ich hab noch nie an lesbensex gedacht hm na ja ekelig find ich die vorstellung zumindest nicht
4328621 sie wird uns schon zu nix zwingen ich lass mal alles auf mich zukommen ein wenig kribbelt es mich ja schon erotisch so eine sklavin zu spielen f r ein wochenende nackt zu sein im hamam aliyah zu waschen und zu massieren also ein wenig lesbisch erotische neugierde ist da ja doch dabei sonst w rden wir es ja nicht machen oder

4328655 theirs was a new york love a checkered taxi ride burning rubber and like the city their passion was open 24 7 steam rising from their bodies like slick streets exhaling warm moist white breath through manhole covers stamped forged by delaney bros
4328656 the penguin stood on the iceberg cutting a striking black on white profile much like the silhouette produced by a person standing behind a screen in front of a bright light while holding up a twinkie to represent the penguin and placing it atop a yorkshire terrier to represent the iceberg
4328657 can we just look around a bit more these are expensive
4328658 wait a second what does this mean are we leaving
4328659 yes ill get you the sneakers dont worry i have the money
4328660 she was a loving and giving person she was always there for you
4328661 it was her personality she was always smiling and she had good common sense
4328662 we always asked bernie to bring the pie because she made the best pies
4328663 but pardon us if we want to take a wait and see attitude there has to be a legitimate open convention with an acknowledgement that by their own rules the democratic party does not now have an official nominee
4328664 some of us get a little tired of seeing obama bend over backwards to make hillary feel comfortable when she rarely if ever returns the favor
4328665 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4328666 sen clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4328667 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4328668 theres considerable anger over the belief that the media mistreated her during the campaign
4328669 there was some difficulty for people to get beyond her gender
4328670 sen clinton will be speaking at the convention for many of those having difficulty it will be a good time of transition
4328671 even though clinton backers are disappointed i think that disappointment will be trumped by their desire to have a president who gets it
4328672 remember if you always do what youve always done youll
4328673 la dictadura de ib ez persigui a miembros de todos los partidos no incondicionales suyos y mont a su alrededor una red de soplones aplic una pol tica que llam de termocauterio arriba y abajo el partido comunista fue puesto al margen de la ley sus peri dicos clausurados sus dirigentes encarcelados relegados torturados y varios asesinados fueron perseguidos la federaci n obrera de chile foch y la asociaci n general de profesores de chile
4328674 tengo la ntima convicci n dijo allende que no estamos en condiciones de apreciar la trascendencia de estas iniciativas en toda su magnitud el tiempo les dar las proyecciones que en mi visi n ellas tienen para la defensa de la raza la protecci n del capital humano y en lo que ellas significan para evitar las tremendas injusticias que derivan de la existencia en nuestro pa s de diferentes estratos sociales
4328675 reconocemos que estos son tiempos urgentes tiempos de esfuerzos y siembra son asimismo tiempos de desaf os y peligros hay una imperiosa necesidad de dar batalla contra los inevitables aliados del desarrollo econ mico insuficiente aguda pobreza ignorancia y desesperaci n hay una urgente necesidad de incluir a millones de habitantes de nuestro continente lo m s pronto posible en los beneficios y oportunidades ofrecidos por la educaci n la cultura y el desarrollo econ mico del siglo xx los pueblos no pueden esperar m s tiempo y su insatisfacci n ya no puede ser ignorada
4328676 por una universidad cuyo norte sean chile y su pueblo
4328677 not many people know that they can find a variety of things here besides fresh agricultural produce they can also learn about our culture
4328678 the mpga issue will be resolved by the end of this month while that of mta by year end
4328679 the sco constitution is clear and will not lead to confusion except when there is interference from certain personalities
4328680 when these issues are resolved only then can the sports commissioners office concentrate on developing sports associations
4328681 im pretty confident im hitting the ball really well which is good tee to green im really well
4328682 im working on my putts a little bit i feel good about the way im swinging the club
4328683 im working the best to my ability to fix it you know and i think its improving its a step but its improving
4328684 its not very long so you dont really need you know to hit driver every hole
4328685 with the introduction of the super league with no limitations i believe it will be a very open competition with the chances for all teams being even
4328686 in 3 days 60 hours i sit in front of computer for 58 hours besides eating and going to restroom i feel so good and i earn 200 rmb
4328687 households who are concerned about their jobs their homes and their ongoing ability to pay their bills will be left with no choice but to cut back on both heating and eating this winter
4328688 were trying to expand the electorate and create a coalition of the center and of the conservatives
4328689 we hope our installations will bring about a net cooling of the area and if the melt is not stopped that it is at least slowed
4328690 it the track is pretty smooth a little hard but its a fast track so no complaints
4328691 they are in touch with the international federation to get all the facts
4328692 i wanted to take gold so i consider this olympics a failure
4328693 our government has worked hard to ensure that in india the rate of inflation is not as high as in many other countries
4328694 i know how much each one of you is concerned about the recent rise in prices the inflation we have seen this year is basically due to external factors
4328695 however while making these efforts we should avoid doing anything which hurts our growth
4328696 i can prove it with the international organisations already bringing testimony to what im saying
4328697 if tomorrow mr saakashvili signs the document that we have negotiated with russian president mr medvedev then the withdrawal of russian troops can begin
4328698 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4328699 this is going to be a defining crisis in the united states russian relationship the danger is that neither side feels it can back down
4328700 we may only be at the beginning of this crisis rather than at the end of it
4328701 we have no idea what they are doing there why such a heavy force
4328702 one explanation could be that they are just trying to battle the civilian population
4328703 we have information that american military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to tbilisi airport though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago
4328704 lets ask them will they invite you the media to check whether it is humanitarian or not what is in it the cargo in reality it is of major concern to russians
4328705 we were pleased with the waca reaction and we also took feedback from players that the changes could be accommodated without compromising what will be a defacto world test cricket championship bout between australian and south africa sutherland said
4328706 the changes can be made without compromising crickets premium format and allow the significant benefits which the new champions league will offer grassroots cricket to be delivered
4328707 we were pleased with the waca reaction and we also took feedback from players that the changes could be accommodated without compromising what will be a defacto world test cricket championship bout between australian and south africa sutherland said

4328709 purely on form and personnel i rated the eagles at 1 65 and melbourne at 2 25 but the market is around the other way
4328710 the eagles are 2 10 and melbournes in as short as 1 80
4328711 all the punters know if the eagles win this one they lose the priority draft pick thats a huge factor and theres no doubt its had a big influence on the odds for the game
4328712 this is a real test for the afl now that it has sanctioned betting and gains revenue from it
4328713 its the game of the round but im going for the roos because of the telstra dome factor
4328714 were told daniel bradshaws in doubt and obviously jonathan browns got his problems so its not surprising the punters have come for the dogs theyve been 1 90 into 1 75 with us including a 10 000 bet at the 1 90
4328715 how the hell can he still be favourite ahead of harvey in most markets
4328716 purely on form and personnel i rated the eagles at 1 65 and melbourne at 2 25 but the market is around the other way
4328717 the eagles are 2 10 and melbourne amp squo s in as short as 1 80
4328718 all the punters know if the eagles win this one they lose the priority draft pick that amp squo s a huge factor and there amp squo s no doubt it amp squo s had a big influence on the odds for the game

4328724 they cant get over it the rage and its inhuman to ask them to get over it
4328725 i want aboriginal men to take more responsibility to stand up to violence against women and children
4328726 but when it is happening of course government has a responsibility to stop it its not rage thats killing these communities it is the sense of resignation that nothing can change it can change it must change
4328727 we cant minimise how we deal with violence at a personal level it requires accountability and personal responsibility on the part of perpetrators
4328728 in the communities there is still too much denial and looking away
4328729 the prime minister john howard had responded to the call of the indigenous women to come to the aid of them and their children
4328730 once more the white man was being chosen over the dysfunctional black man as the protector of children the defeat of the black man was absolute
4328731 the already persecuted women will be seen as having colluded with the enemy to remove the few strands of self esteem the indigenous man had left
4328732 the main concern i have with what she is saying is that it actually gives a sense of no hope
4328733 are you better off now than you were eight years ago
4328734 its the early stages of dating she is a little boy crazy over him
4328735 it has become clear since the filing of this case that mr vick has very limited
4328736 i can think of no better project than one that increases transit ridership and mobility by simply opening up access to an existing passenger rail line that today runs through the city of evanston without opening its doors

4328769 i think that as long as fair er trade ultimately leads to fair trade then it ia alright but if fair er trade is substituted for fair trade then there is a problem because there is still the element of exploitation in the process
4328770 despite differences in language culture and economic status people around the world are united in their fundamental need to connect discover and interact ebay fosters human connections through social commerce
4328771 despite differences in language culture and economic status people around the world are united in their fundamental need to connect discover and interact
4328772 this is a major disappointment at a time when food and fuel prices are high and the global economic outlook is uncertain the worlds poorest people are increasingly vulnerable a decent trade deal could have given them a chance to prevent worsening poverty
4328773 rich countries should have shown the political leadership to deliver trade reform that reduced poverty instead they defended vested interests and put poor countries under intense pressure to make concessions that have no place in a development round
4328774 this is another missed opportunity for trade reform that poor countries badly need and have been long promised it was brought about by rich countries failure to keep their word
4328775 it would be outrageous to blame poor countries for the failure to get a deal if the eu and us had made meaningful offers that lived up to their promises we might have seen progress instead they demanded harsh concessions from developing countries in exchange for largely illusory reforms and limited flexibilities

4328846 we need to take a hard look at this and whether we should be really looking to make profits on the back of this sort of misery
4328847 fundamentally this is about how the kids get hold of alcohol

4328849 fifty percent our research is showing are getting it from other than over the counter
4328850 we need all of us to actually wake up in this country we have got a real problem with the way alcohol is marketed the way it is consumed

4328867 traditionally copyright owners sold their copyrighted material in exchange for money
4328868 the lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration however
4328869 furthermore the event will recognise the tremendous steps which have been made by individuals and by the community as a whole in rebuilding lives in our town and a key element of the ceremony will be a communal dedication to peace
4328870 we had 600 students per month for over 20 years sometimes people would wait a whole year to sign up for their class everything was full from seven in the morning to seven at night the teachers ate in the gym there was no time
4328871 waldemar was a student of the family for twelve or thirteen years
4328872 he fought more than 20 times for our academy what happened was he had a disagreement with helio gracie and they decided to fight vale tudo and waldemar won in fact i was a friend of his and told him look waldemar we are friends but now i cant let it pass you beat helio now your going to have to fight me i have nothing against you but in the ring im going to beat the s t out of you and i did i fought against him six times i won four times and two were a draw he was tough s t if it were today he would be one of the best fighters
4328873 it felt like my organs would be torn into pieces
4328874 i chased him throwing kicks and open hand strikes he returned head butts and elbow strikes but neither of us was able to deliver a decisive strike maybe we were both exhausted or maybe the blood in our eyes prevented us from aiming clearly at the target after all the 40 minutes ran out and the match ended in a draw it was my first vale tudo experience that night my face was badly swollen i had a number of cuts on my face every time i breathed an excruciating pain ran through my belly and i could not sleep i received an injection from a doctor and cooled my belly with a cold towel all night however i learned a very important lesson in this fight that is one must never fear death if i had not had the iron will to fight despite the possibility of getting killed his head butts would have torn my intestine into pieces
4328875 this is hard but end admitting that they are continuous and annoying youre like go away
4328876 del mar gave me my start as a student provided my foundation both academically and for life in general so its important for me to have this opportunity to come back and possible give back to the community
4328877 the charter schools who are successful have a strong well educated committed administrative team who excel at creative problem solving
4328878 require volunteer hours abide by a behavior and or academic contracts and have strict attendance requirements
4328879 the intent of the legislature was to provide opportunities for teachers parents pupils and community members to establish and maintain schools that operate independently from the existing school district structure
4328880 we would prefer no more reductions but we must keep expenses in line with revenue
4328881 if advertising and circulation revenues continue to decline further payroll reductions may be necessary
4328882 we anticipate having an agreement signed within the next two to three weeks
4328883 its really great here to be here in oakland california
4328884 but pardon us if we want to take a wait and see attitude there has to be a legitimate open convention with an acknowledgement that by their own rules the democratic party does not now have an official nominee
4328885 some of us get a little tired of seeing obama bend over backwards to make hillary feel comfortable when she rarely if ever returns the favor
4328886 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4328887 sen clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4328888 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4328889 theres considerable anger over the belief that the media mistreated her during the campaign
4328890 there was some difficulty for people to get beyond her gender
4328891 sen clinton will be speaking at the convention for many of those having difficulty it will be a good time of transition
4328892 even though clinton backers are disappointed i think that disappointment will be trumped by their desire to have a president who gets it
4328893 i tell you the truth anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to christ will certainly not lose his reward
4328894 yes indeed we have no way out except through the blood
4328895 therefore we do not lose heart though outwardly we are wasting away yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day for our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all
4328896 i experience him because i choose to i make choices every day to look for him listen for him and acknowledge him even though the world tugs at me to serve many lesser gods in the depths of my heart i choose him
4328897 seek god with all of your heart and dont be satisfied with merely paying lip service to having a relationship with him
4328898 we dont need to worry about our abilities or our shortcomings when we know we already have all we need through jesus
4328899 mancini has done so much perhaps in 6 or 7 years i could approach what he did for sampdoria
4328900 its a pity he has been sent away from inter in three years he has won many trophies and that had not been the case at inter for years
4328901 the situation was massacred by the press and in society and he mancini was not protected
4328902 over the next three to four years he mourinho will win everything
4328903 he juventus coach claudio ranieri has a great team but i do not believe they can win the champions if juve were to reach the quarters or the second round would have already done a lot a final victory would be a miracle
4328904 there is a basic need to connect that all of us have as people
4328905 theres a need to not feel alone and to know that we arent the only ones going through something
4328906 ive got this great family that understands the best they can
4328907 i tend to just pretend im fine when im not
4328908 there are people in serious pain who dont think theyll get through the day
4328909 theyre just looking for a place where they feel like they can talk about it in comfort
4328910 its about giving everyone the most information possible to help them make the right decisions
4328911 these people are desperate for information desperate for a cure they are ripe for manipulation
4328912 you can type in a symptom and get 100 different possible diagnoses
4328913 patients who are predisposed to have a lot of anxiety will latch on to the worst possible scenario even if that scenario is extraordinarily remote and start to believe they have that illness
4328914 these folks can learn a lot about a disease that you really dont have a lot of time to figure out
4328915 if theres something rare im never going to become an expert
4328916 were far flung and were such a small group its truly dependent on that network
4328917 kids will grow up knowing kids like them thats what brings me to tears this couldnt have happened without the internet
4328918 there are a lot of sites out there like webmd for dealing with sprained ankles
4328919 but these diseases are overlooked on other sites for the most part
4328920 music and movie companies now have a channel for content distribution where they can get paid
4328921 she is very fond of john and has thought he might be the one she finds him funny sexy and very talented plus he understands all the aspects of living in a fishbowl but in the final analysis she just got tired of his roving eye
4328922 we will not agree to protect special subsidies that have produced the highest health care costs in the nation without producing better care
4328923 we can put a man on the moon we can really fix this
4328924 every pakistani is with our brothers and sisters in srinagar
4328925 we are not certain we are going to go forward with the meeting at this point our position with the iihf has been very clear if the khl doesnt disqualify alexander radulov from playing in their league so he can abide to his contractual obligations to nashville we have no interest in meeting with them and or engaging in discussions over any broader cooperative relationship with them
4328926 you know we would still like to and we still have offered to meet with the iihf and the other federations but it is not certain at this point in time where that will happen or not
4328927 it is a very complicated picture right now we dont have a players transfer agreement our clubs were told and were obligated not to secure individual releases of players from teams so only those who are free of contractual obligations were free to come here this summer there ended up being a lot of those players but we are still hopeful that well end up doing a new players transfer agreement if not with the russians with the rest of the federations as we had for the last three years
4328928 that is why we still want to meet with them in september to see if it can be done it is an unsettled situation there is no doubt there is a lot left to play out here
4328929 i dont think at this point it is something that will impact our business in the short term obviously we will see how things play out it could become significant you know it plays into the broader issue with the russian league and the russian federation and that is kind of unsettled right now there are a lot of question marks
4328930 they are playing a team that won a iihf tournament
4328931 it is something we are contractually obligated to do obviously you examine things when the relations go a little bit sour but i think it is something the rangers are committed to doing it is important to them just to be able to play those games
4328932 for 10 minutes i liked back to black winehouses 2006 album
4328933 but when i read the lyrics i thought it was sad i would like to invite her here i feel sympathetic to people like her she could stay a week or two and discuss the big questions of life faith might be an answer for her
4328934 there were stormy moments for her a lot of tears and a lot of struggle
4328935 i have this recollection of somebody asking me for lawyers in new york and i remember naming three or four and he must have been one of them
4328936 it was either her who called or somebody on her behalf
4328937 i remember getting a call from pam and her telling me that she was representing him
4328938 i may have sent him over there but on the other hand i may not have i dont have an accurate recollection
4328939 i have a brief recollection of giving someone some cash my assumption is i loaned some small amount of money to the both of them
4328940 ms hunter called me i represent her and only her as i would any client
4328941 was making a classic you better believe me it will be a monster we want to go out into the world
4328942 i should definitely make the team better theres no ifs ands or buts about it i already know what kind of coach rick adelman is and i definitely should be able to help out
4328943 when you get a chance to play for same organization that had hakeem olajuwon and clyde drexler youve got to appreciate that
4328944 from hearing rons recent statements its obvious that he has an immense desire to win
4328945 we have a team of players who have that same immense desire and ron will fit right in
4328946 i cant believe he did it this is amazing im so happy i can only jump up and down
4328947 the first thing i thought of was my parents and my coach
4328948 we are proud descendants of the great ghengis khan and tuvshee proved the strength of mongolians in the
4328949 it is so exciting that our mongolian flag was raised in beijing and tuvshee won in the judo competition
4328950 me and several of my friends have bought mongolian vodka to celebrate this wonderful news it is going to be a very exciting night
4328951 right after the june 29 election we were in central square protesting election results and throwing stones against policemen and interior troops

4328958 god helps me forgive them but i dont like these jokes
4328959 religious education here indoctrinates fuelling prejudice against other faiths and against sexual minorities
4328960 but its more than this teaching children to discriminate against something builds a national mentality and in the end people reject differences and discriminate against everything
4328961 credibly asserted that authorities pressured children of other faiths to attend classes of orthodox religion
4328962 religious and sexual discrimination are not a problem of the schools as far as i know all religions say their god is the greatest and almost all disagree with homosexuality and we cant change peoples faiths
4328963 the values offered by religious education are needed desperately in times of aggressive and materialist individualism
4328964 cults seeking to introduce christ to the romanian people as if they havent known him for almost two millennia
4328965 romanian politicians have an instinctive fear of excommunication and they rarely oppose the views of the church
4328966 for all intents and purposes any proposal for charter change even if its forced will be dead
4328967 if the sentiment of an overwhelming majority of the house is for renegotiation there is nothing to take up with respect to any charter change proposal that relates to bangsamoro homeland
4328968 many members of the majority coalition in the house will not go for a charter change at this time because if there is a proposal to change the system of government it will affect their own presidentiable
4328969 the kind of federalism that malaca ang is pushing is not feasible
4328970 in bicol we should be able to enjoy the same rights benefits and powers that they are giving to the bangsamoro an exclusive privilege to develop our own natural resources to set up our own system of governance set up our own civil service electoral laws banking system

4328976 the whole tour was a great success we were the first ones to fly an all star project like this around the world wacken was an experience id never had before of course we had played to 30 000 people before edguy have played stadiums with iron maiden or the scorpions we have toured with aerosmith and even on our own tours we played huge crowds here and there but wacken was beyond your imagination i stood there and estimated 80 000 family members seemed to tie a bond between them and me usually i talk a lot and i joke around but when i was on stage and looked into this ocean of hands in the air i felt something special between the audience and me and i was almost starting to cry it was magic and in that moment i felt blessed i am i know i sound a bit wimpy but i dont fucking care sometimes you should stop pretending to be a hero and just be thankful for how great life is and thank the people who made it possible
4328977 absolutely true weve had a camera team following us around the world there will be an extended road documentary movie and we have shot some concerts masters of rock and wacken as well i have seen some scenes already i got goose bumps all over my body 80 000 people going crazy nobody has ever sent a project like that around the world and weve had cameras following us literally 24 hours a day we will give fans a very intimate view behind the scenes it will take some time until it gets released but i swear it will be the kind of dvd you have never ever seen before
4328978 if it was stress i wouldnt do it i played 14 shows in half a year i finished the latest avantasia album almost one year ago already i think its no big deal to write ten songs in twelve months if you dont have a regular job i dont do drugs i get high on writing great songs that make my flesh crawl its no stress its a blessing
4328979 we dont go back to the roots we never denied who we are and where we come from so i dont see a reason to go back to wherever
4328980 i dont think rocket ride was totally goofy but maybe it was too obvious that we wanted to show the world that were ready to disregard conventions
4328981 i dont know the man but i grew up watching him on tv

4328996 thats kind of a vague career goal but they started to tease me about that as the day went on i guess ill follow you now id rather have attention than you know have nobody know who i was

4329041 they havent got a clue what goes on in the world
4329042 none of them can relate to me and the goings on in my life outside of the confines of the beis hamedrash and nobody teaches the ancient text of the torah in a manner which makes it fresh and relevant
4329043 your quasi philosophical ramblings are of no interest can we please go back to topical discussions
4329044 part of the reason for the modest number of attendees is the fact that its currently all in english ill leave it to others to comment on this pro amp con
4329045 rav lichtenstein has no right to argue with the undisputed posek hador unless he has someone of that status to back him up

4329062 they managed perfectly well without them when they were younger

4329076 all you want is for your view and venom to be heard
4329077 in the earliest wave of pioneers in any new disruptive platform the marginal and the dispossessed are over represented not the sole constituents by any means but people who feel they dont fit who have nothing left to lose or who were impelled by some kind of dream who may be outsiders to whatever mainstream they are coming from all come and arrive early in disproportionate numbers that sort of arduous frontier conditions really give these environments their charm and their character that is going to make things challenging for people who feel that as the frontier is being settled and there is less novelty and in some senses less freedom it is always an uneasy transition for the pioneers

4329081 am disappointed that you do not seem prepared to allow your forum to be used to usefully discuss this desparately important and under aired issue
4329082 the actual reason moshiach is not here yet is zionism
4329083 subjects too sensitive to publish in depth to a wide audience
4329084 im not seeking recognition for it and am willing to let you use it and edit it whichever way you wish as well as allowing you to attribute it to whichever writer you want
4329085 for publication no fee or accreditation requested for the good of the klal i would welcome and value your feedback the internet is a very useful tool nobody can dispute that and as

4329093 sadly your closing comments imply that you suffer from the ubiquitous mindset of attacking your detractors instead of trying to understand them and bring them on board it is a matter of deep regret to me that my complaint about you seems to have been vindicated
4329094 i refer the honourable lady gentleman to the reply i gave some moments ago
4329095 of course no paper was ever going to publish an article by an outstpoken blogger

4329097 there was no need to treat him like a leper why could they not discuss the article with him is he subhuman
4329098 those who hear the warnings and dont understand them and go ahead and get access to the net the ones who dont say naase vnishma find out soon enough what the net is like and whether they agree or disagree with you
4329099 i find it hard to believe there are many who dont understand the nature of the danger especially younger and middle aged parents who are the ones they are targeting with proclamations against these technologies
4329100 lets train people appropriate gaurds to use within an acceptable framework whereby they are aware of the dangers out there and the countless programmes that are available to protect users against such harm instead of a blanket statement of no internet
4329101 have a workshop for parents on how to safegaurd their homes but yet use the internet for the good it has to offer
4329102 were i to identify myself would you publish the article is it the sort of thing you would publish have you even considered it

4329108 whoever loves discipline loves knowledge but he who hates correction is stupid
4329109 a man is praised according to his wisdom but men with warped minds are despised
4329110 he who works his land will have abundant food but he who chases fantasies lacks judgment
4329111 the way of a fool seems right to him but a wise man listens to advice
4329112 truthful lips endure forever but a lying tongue lasts only a moment
4329113 an anxious heart weighs a man down but a kind word cheers him up
4329114 a righteous man is cautious in friendship but the way of the wicked leads them astray

4329116 yes he hasnt been seen since the night before he disappeared
4329117 alright put kae with sakura and naruto they should make an excellent team with kakashi an ex anbu sakura a medical ninja and naruto a head on fighter theyll make a good team dont forget to warn kakashi about that demon dog though it would be disasterous if anything were to happen because he didnt know about it

4329120 like i said before jackass i didnt do anything rayne has a conscious mind and i cannot control her
4329121 from the fruits of his lips a man enjoys good things but the unfaithful have a craving for violence
4329122 he who guards his lips guards his life but he who speaks rashly will come to ruin
4329123 pride only breeds quarrels but wisdom is found in those who take advice
4329124 he who scores instruction will pay for it but he who respects a command is rewarded
4329125 he who ignores discipline comes to poverty and shame but whoever needs correction is honored
4329126 you should have seen the stupid look on your face
4329127 what the hell do you think you are doing here
4329128 i heard that you needed some more help and i figured that my services would be necessary
4329129 you just expect me to sit down and write the great american novel just like that
4329130 look around golders green on shabbos and see how many people carry in the eruv very very few
4329131 the halochoh is halochoh the torah was not written to suit us and to be popular
4329132 just to add many major excuses for not using the eruv that people have brought up have long since been changed for example the issue with spaniards inn
4329133 this is because there are so many rabonim amp shuls being spoilt for choice no one has chosen a ruv to listen to
4329134 it reminds me of the leaflet i picked up at munks in gg that gave advice to visitors e
4329135 there is no eruv in gg so one may not carry on shabbos
4329136 the golders green area has a large eruv created and maintained under the auspices of the united synagogues london beth din

4329172 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4329173 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4329174 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4329175 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4329176 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4329177 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4329178 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4329179 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4329180 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4329181 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4329182 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4329183 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4329184 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4329185 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4329186 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4329187 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4329188 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4329189 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4329190 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4329191 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4329192 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4329193 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4329194 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4329195 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4329196 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4329197 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4329198 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4329199 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4329200 screening for depression during pregnancy is important for this population group given latinas high rates of fertility and births to single women particularly among more acculturated u s born latinas
4329201 the sample for this study was a low income population
4329202 our conclusions may or may not be different for women in other socioeconomic status ses groups hence more research needs to be conducted among latinas from differing ses groups including research focusing on the role of social support and cultural values beliefs related to childbirth and pregnancy among latinas
4329203 the higher prevalence rate of depression in americanized latina women is of concern in our community as the population demographics clearly indicate a significant rate of growth of this group in their childbearing years
4329204 thus it is important to more clearly understand the circumstances that affect their physical and emotional well being during pregnancy so that preventive measures can be initiated this is critical for the overall health of both the mother and child
4329205 women who were us born were significantly more likely than mexican born women to meet the cutoff score 21 on the ces d scale
4329206 women who conducted their interview in english were significantly more likely to express depressive symptoms compared to women who conducted their interview in spanish
4329207 one thing is for sure we have to keep an eye on this
4329208 because its there because it could develop into something stronger and if it follows what the models are saying it will be in our vicinity over the weekend
4329209 several of our guidance models would like to make it a hurricane

4329219 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4329220 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4329221 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4329222 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4329223 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4329224 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4329225 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4329226 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

4329228 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4329229 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4329230 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4329231 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4329232 i have lived for three fourths of the last century and i can tell you with certainty should china embrace the parliamentary democracy of the western world the only result would be that 1 3 billion chinese people would not have enough food to eat

4329291 a mccain asserts that there should be a tax credit of 10 percent of wages for each r and d employee but this proposal means that there would be a hand out of cash approximately 8 billion per year by my calculation to existing firms even if they added no new employees in r and d and made no new investment moreover if they built a solar farm or a new manufacturing facility they would not get the r and d credit can he possibly mean that this appears to be a hand out to support the status quo and would not do anything to encourage new investment or new job creation do i misread this b mccain suggests that firms providing broadband access to rural and low income users would get tax breaks that apparently would equal their costs in other words the big communications companies would have the government cover in whole their costs for providing service what kind of service how much money how many people i cant figure any of that out with precision but given that we have about 45 million households without broadband i could imagine that the tax break for the handful of firms that provide internet access would amount to as much as 45 million households times 500 year rough estimate of cost per household or 22 5 billion a year if market shares now extant hold constant that would be a tax break of about 8 billion a year for the two bell companies alone can this be what mccain really wants if not that what is he proposing c mccain declines to put net neutrality into law indeed he declines to guarantee all americans the right to obtain the information they want communicate to everyone they want send non obscene and lawful information to anyone they want over the internet why whats the hold up why not assure this paradigm instead mccain wants the fcc to decide these net neutrality on a case by case basis that way provides no predictability for investors no assurance for americans and of course plenty of opportunity for lawyers and lobbyists to capture the process and for what
4329292 as president john mccain will establish a permanent research and development r amp d tax credit equal to 10 percent of wages spent on r amp d offering a tax credit for r amp d wages will encourage the creation of innovation driven jobs in the united states

4329339 the independent review will address a wide range of issues and report by the end of september 2008
4329340 the review will provide recommendations on the location of a single facility which could be located at a new site or one of the existing dpi amp f sites on the tablelands
4329341 interested parties are invited to have their say to ensure all views are considered as part of the review
4329342 a single purpose built facility will capitalise on the uniqueness of the region and its potential for economic growth
4329343 developing new skills and capabilities will enable us to exploit the commercial opportunities in north australia and the asia pacific region in tropical agriculture extension and training
4329344 it also makes good sense to consolidate investment in the region in order to give the tablelands the state of the art facility that it truly needs to move forward we should shift out of the ageing facilities that are costing us far too much to operate
4329345 the vision for the tablelands ensures our efforts are relevant to the changing face of queenslands primary industries

4329380 the chill continues thats the danger and the risk and the problem that we tried to stress it creates a sword of damocles that inhibits authors and publishers and readers cant read about it

4329382 the new york court of appeals could have done a better job of protecting our constitutional rights than it did here with this rather technical opinion

4329384 we do not support terrorism but america got what it deserved
4329385 i dont like setting targets i think really the major target is going to be staying in the premier league
4329386 obviously wed like to improve considerably from what we did last year but i dont want to quantify that by saying this place or that place
4329387 ill see how the season pans out and see how good we can be and then maybe start setting definite targets during the course of the season
4329388 weve signed players and we are happy with the signings we think that it has made us stronger as a unit
4329389 its a new team it might take a bit of time for certain positions to bed in but i have been very happy with the way people have been working in the pre season i have been very happy with the pre season results
4329390 he had a thigh strain when he arrived from everton and we dont want to take the risk by playing him too early im pretty sure he will be able to play against arsenal on aug 23 but well have to do without him at hull

4329399 s claro que vamos a tocar temas diferentes pero no s lo de black sabbath sino tambi n de lo nuevo de heaven and hell
4329400 s empezamos tocando conciertos m s largos pero tuvimos que recortarlo en un par de shows que ten amos menos tiempo
4329401 escuch en un primer momento que se iban a reunir los 4 y me pareci un poco injusto porque yo hab a tocado mucho m s tiempo con ronnie que bill pero bueno no pod a hacer nada y me parec a bien la reuni n pese a todo poco tiempo despu s parece que esa formaci n no termin de cuajar y recib una llamada invit ndome a participar con ellos y por supuesto dije que s y funcion muy bien de todos modos adoro a bill es uno de mis dolos un tipo estupendo e incluso l sugiri que pod amos hacer la gira los dos l tocando sus temas y yo los m os porque a l no le gusta tocar canciones que no sean suyas yo siempre he tocado temas de otra gente con lo que no ten a ning n problema con eso pero bill siempre ha sido bill risas y l propuso que hubiera dos bater as pero hubiera habido problemas y l os varios y al final no se hizo
4329402 despu s de que yo dejara el grupo para tocar con ozzy risas no estuvo bien y finalmente hemos tenido la oportunidad de conducir el mismo coche juntos habl ndolo todo y ahora s lo hay agua sobre el puente hay que mirar adelante las cosas pasan y ya est pero ahora mismo hay realmente muy buen rollo entre todos los miembros del grupo una relaci n y un ambiente muy agradable

4329407 dit was echt heel slecht hier werk je vier jaar voor en dan doe het zo slecht dit mag nooit gebeuren ik moet nu revanche nemen
4329408 nu je het zegt realiseer ik me dat het inderdaad pas twee jaar en een paar dagen geleden is dat ik bij fc omniworld debuteerde
4329409 we verloren met 3 0 tegen dordrecht ik werd in de rust gewisseld nu draag ik het shirt van psv en ben ik een kanshebber voor een plaats in de basis ik vind het echt een enorme eer om voor deze club te mogen spelen dit is de europese top ik geniet met volle teugen maak veel plezier maar als we op het veld staan gaat de knop om dan moet er gewerkt worden
4329410 het zal er wel mee te maken hebben dat ik nieuw ben h
4329411 ik vind het vooral prachtig dat de mensen zo enthousiast reageren dat doet me goed
4329412 die doelpunten in oefenwedstrijden zijn leuk maar ik ben nog allesbehalve tevreden
4329413 vooral in de positiespelletjes merk ik dat de anderen wat verder zijn de spelers van psv zijn gewend om de bal n keer te raken ik heb vaak een handeling meer nodig ook moet ik nog leren om v r ik de bal ontvang te kijken wie ik kan aanspelen ik beheers dat nu nog niet zo goed en maak daarom verkeerde keuzes ik werk er hard aan en de spelers proberen me te helpen maar op dat vlak gaat het me nog niet snel genoeg
4329414 natuurlijk zijn de olympische spelen een uniek evenement en had ik er graag aan deelgenomen maar dat ik nu de hele voorbereiding met psv kan meemaken is toch wel heel prettig
4329415 ik heb me er vrij snel overheen kunnen zetten trainer huub stevens weet nu tenminste wat hij aan me heeft het olympisch team volg ik nu als supporter en daar heb ik vrede mee ik vind het fantastisch dat ze een ronde verder zijn
4329416 we gingen niet direct van een finaleplek uit maar als je de statistieken bekijkt heeft de laatste jaren altijd de reserve geturnd
4329417 nu zitten wij te wachten en dan gebeurt er niks
4329418 but when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him then he will sit upon his glorious throne
4329419 then these righteous ones will reply lord when did we ever see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink
4329420 then the king will turn to those on the left and say away with you you cursed ones into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his demons for i was hungry and you didnt feed me i was thirsty and you didnt give me anything to drink
4329421 then they will reply lord when did we ever see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and not help you

4329429 if your management begins to benchmark you against someone elses data center pue you need to be sure what youre benchmarking against
4329430 there is a lot of competitive manipulation and gaming going on

4329439 a lot of investors who have been buying commodities not just on a global growth story but as a hedge against a weak dollar are unloading those commodities based on a much more constrained global outlook and going back into the u s dollar
4329440 well have some people targeting 750 but i think we would need to see a continuation in that dollar strength to give it sufficient momentum to head that way
4329441 history shows a strong and consistent correlation between weak currencies and falling stock markets
4329442 weak currencies are a symptom of a deeper problem slowing economic growth out of control inflation or structural issues that reduce the attractiveness of equities
4329443 we expect some things to be controlled in a directed economy the question is the unpredictability
4329444 russia has become the largest risk in the financial markets

4329453 were very honored to be recognized as one of the
4329454 i have come across many situations where the dst tm would have been a useful tool for my clients there was a situation i ran into recently where a large land holder sold some land and couldnt place the money in time using a 1031 exchange and had to pay taxes on a portion of the proceeds the dst tm would have offered the perfect way out now i have the dst tm tax deferral strategy in my arsenal as a more comprehensive way to aid my clients and help them sell their property tax deferred
4329455 the dst tm program is a huge cash saver to a commercial property seller who fails to qualify for a 1031 now he can relax take his time and no longer has to make a hurried up like kind exchange decision because of the benefits a dst tm strategy can provide the ability to meet my clients objectives through providing an additional valuable service which saves them real dollars further bolsters my credibility as a valuable professional advisor
4329456 i am excited to offer a great alternative to the traditional and
4329457 we look forward to showing realtors how the deferred sales trust can help their clients liquidate their real estate or small business without the concern that capital gain tax will take a bite out of their net proceeds
4329458 the dst is also a potential rescue for failing 1031 exchanges if the property owner has identified an exchange property within the 45 day window but is unable to close within the 180 day deadline

4329482 when i did that i thought i could be the best at this from then it was never an if it was just when
4329483 if you look at the stats that season it might be one of the best outdoor seasons for any shot putter even minus that major championship
4329484 i dont feel any different making the team this time
4329485 i feel like im at a point in my career when i can kind of start over
4329486 whenever i made the team i thought there would be this big awe moment
4329487 it never happened i was just mad i got second at the trials
4329488 i was running late before a warm up meet before the national indoor trials last year
4329489 i just showed up and threw one of my best ever
4329490 just to have the ability to walk into the ring with no warm up and deliver a huge throw is a huge advantage
4329491 if its going well you really dont even really remember what happened

4329494 this prominent circular feature in the sahara desert of mauritania has attracted attention since the earliest space missions because it forms a conspicuous in the otherwise rather featureless expanse of the desert described by some as looking like an outsized fossil in the desert the structure which has a diameter of almost 30 miles has become a landmark for shuttle crews initially interpreted as a meteorite impact structure because of its high degree of circularity it is now thought to be merely a symmetrical uplift that has been laid bare by erosion paleozoic quartzites form the resistant beds outlining the structure
4329495 once thought to be the result of a meteor impact today researchers believe the richat structure was caused by process of geological uplift followed by erosion from wind and water the onion like formation is formed by concentric bands of resistant quartzite rocks form ridges and between with valleys of less resistant rock between them

4329523 sexual orientation emerges for most people in early adolescence without any prior sexual experience and some people report trying very hard over many years to change their sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual with no success for these reasons psychologists do not consider sexual orientation for most people to be a conscious choice that can be voluntarily changed
4329524 homosexuality was thought to be a mental illness in the past because mental health professionals and society had biased information about homosexuality since most studies only involved lesbians and gay men in therapy when researchers examined data about gay people who were not in therapy the idea that homosexuality was a mental illness was found to be untrue
4329525 in order to comprehend what the bible says about gay and lesbian relationships we must pass over the references to homosexual rape male sexual abuse of boys and homosexual prostitution orgies pagan sexual rituals in temples etc
4329526 however there are descriptions of close and intimate relationships between members of the same gender but there are no unambiguous passages that show that they were sexually active one is forced to conclude that the bible often condemns heterosexual and homosexual exploitive manipulative sex and prostitution but may be totally silent on consensual homosexual relationships
4329527 one is left with many biblical passages which condemn fornication sex outside of marriage if one were to accept these passages as inspired by god then one can conclude that the bible considers homosexual sex within a committed relationship equivalent to premarital sex between a man and a woman that is homosexual activity within a committed relationship is morally equivalent to a man and woman living together common law without being married
4329528 the bible says nothing about sexual orientation for the same reason why it does not mention television sets and airplanes the concept of orientation dates only from the late 19th century and only began to be seriously investigated in the middle of the 20th century

4329594 being at the last all star game at the old place was such a thrill and to link the two together is going to be pretty neat
4329595 obviously it is going to be a very special day
4329596 theres so much history with the yankees and with the new stadium i am sure a lot of people who have meant a lot to this game will be there that day
4329597 three years ago congress imposed a renewable fuel standard rfs mandate that has forced the gasoline industry to mix massive amounts of corn based ethanol into the nations fuel supply in 2007 congress nearly doubled that mandate to require nine billion gallons of ethanol be blended into gas in 2008 and even more in 2009
4329598 as we can see now the diversion of our corn supply from grocery stores to gasoline pumps has caused the price of corn to spiral out of control corn prices were once driven by market forces today they are artificially driven up by a government mandate in 2004 before the mandates were imposed the cost of corn hovered around 2 per bushel now it is close to 8 per bushel this is driving up the cost of staple food items at the grocery store and it is also driving up the price of corn based feed devastating the liv estock industry to the point that texas cattle feeders have been operating in the red since 2007
4329599 supporters of the ethanol mandate have their hearts in the right place if they want to diversify this nations fuel supply but artificially propping up an industry to the detriment of the vast majority of americans is bad policy and thats what this mandate does
4329600 now turn from your sins and turn to god so you can be cleansed of your sins
4329601 oh yeh we also have no idea when our next shipment will be
4329602 at this time of the year every win is huge no matter who you play
4329603 washington is looking to knock you off theyre looking to make a mark for themselves
4329604 weve not been able to take advantage of teams under 500 coming in here we know that every time we come here the washington nationals always find a way to play good baseball against us this time we really approached them the same way we approached the phillies and the teams in contention
4329605 that second time through the lineup it looked like they made adjustments
4329606 we need to take care of things for ourselves what we can control we need to take care of business every day
4329607 but they did a good job of shutting us down the next three innings
4329608 the umpires dont get that close a look at those balls over the fence or near the foul poles with the distance and the configuration of the ballparks so it would be nice to see that particular play get right if theres any confusion i dont want to see any other play on replay thats one of the beauties of our game it kind of happens pretty quick
4329609 i want to make sure that if and when we do it its really good its perfect
4329610 itll be very limited i want to make sure and im not quite certain yet but we should have answers very shortly
4329611 i think the industry has to stay up with the technology
4329612 it is something that i am going to have to get used to basically getting my feet into the shape where they can tolerate it
4329613 my feet are not in the same position they have been in for the first 30 years of my life so it is kind of putting them in a new position and they are not comfortable with it
4329614 they are sore i think i will be all right
4329615 thats one of the main reasons i am doing it
4329616 i am getting there slowly but surely but the season is coming around pretty quick and i am trying to get a sense of how i feel
4329617 im not worried about being in shape or catching the football thats just what i do its more about me being healthy
4329618 if i am not it will be pretty close ill be a lot further along than last year
4329619 the more i rest and the more i take care of my ankle and the more i take care of myself ill be closer to 100 percent if im not ill be 95 or 96 which i will definitely take
4329620 like i said those things will take care of themselves
4329621 my thing right now is to get healthy if it was the case with the contract i would not be out there its all about me getting healthy and getting back to 100 percent you know jerry said what he said i think it will happen

4329648 both have exhibited a cooperative attitude and intend to work with the ade to fully implement the state mandate to the best of their ability
4329649 it is our belief at ade that a positive attitude is the most important part of the implementation process
4329650 biggest concern is consistency school by school and theres no way im going to have consistency based on the teachers we have
4329651 if a student is new to the country and new to the english language hell be in four hours of language development
4329652 but school by school were still going to need some more flexibility depending on staffing
4329653 will be based on staff and well have to tell ade how many hours we can do it
4329654 were just going to have to work with the state to get as close to the state model as we can within our resources but the ade understands the teachers we have are the teachers we have and the number of classrooms we have are the number of classrooms we have
4329655 they will look at three hours of immersion and then one hour of reading which can be in a content area but it still must focus on english instruction
4329656 districts cant mix ell kids with non ell kids even if they are newly classified kids who have just recently tested out of ell but still need the support in the classroom
4329657 and i dont think any district has 100 percent highly qualified teachers for those positions
4329658 want to see where the gaps are what are our data are telling us which will lead us to make adjustments to the services based on how our students are succeeding
4329659 the reason sunnyside submitted our alternative model is because the district and governing board had concerns about ell students being segregated for four hours a day for long periods of time
4329660 we would still hope as kids become more proficient say in reading then we would be able to reduce immersion by a reading hour or writing by a writing hour
4329661 constantly needs to look at how kids are making progress and what we need to do to move them forward
4329662 well be looking at proficiency levels and aims scores to justify fewer than four hours
4329663 and well be looking at keeping four hours but use content in them
4329664 the more proficient the more flexibility we will have to have fewer hours or to have the hours be more content driven
4329665 we know and the state knows were not going to be 100 percent in compliance the question is how close are we going to be able to get
4329666 were going to make every good faith effort to implement the four hours
4329667 not looking for us to be moving around staff this late in the game theyll let us work with existing staff and do it
4329668 we have a real commitment toward graduation for all kids and ell students should not be left behind
4329669 if school districts take full advantage of the many options available through the models that have been approved by a state task force i do not see being able to graduate on time as a problem at all
4329670 the state is not going to mandate how credit is to be awarded
4329671 we need to make sure ell students have the same positive opportunities to be an integral part of their school as any other student
4329672 we dont have a beef about them learning english but we dont want them left behind for other reasons
4329673 our hope is that the students will get the science credit in the science class but our main goal even there is to use it as an english language development class
4329674 important to learn english fast because i need it for my other classes and for me
4329675 thats because of a lot of effort on our part
4329676 some of the students will participate in sports and i also have an after school folklorico class so that gives them some contact

4329733 unfortunately we have no plan but to rely on the russians
4329734 the administration and budget office just havent provided the funds to avoid that
4329735 the concern ive had all along is that we just dont know what the geopolitical landscape will be during those years we have to depend on russia
4329736 you look at the situation now and relying on russia looks like a pretty bad idea
4329737 ive been saying for several years that once the russians have a monopoly on flying astronauts to the station they could and probably would use it to pressure the united states for diplomatic purposes
4329738 if the u s says no then they can always find a reason why a soyuz wouldnt be ready to fly when its needed

4329753 they played him at wide receiver because we had a dire need for wide receivers at the time and he was very athletic hes got the highest vertical on the team and hes one of the faster kids on the team
