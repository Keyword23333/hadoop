6530269 from where the union started to where it is today is leaps and bounds a lot of that credit has to go with gene and what he stood for he stood his ground on a lot of key issues with the backing of the players he was able to get us in a pretty good position in terms of health benefits with the presidents at the time be it troy vincent and trace armstrong they worked to get us in a very good position and hes left us in a very good position
6530270 with genes passing the nfl has lost an innovator players have lost their advocate and i have lost a friend a hall of fame player gene was also a hall of fame businessman and negotiator he always had the best interests of the nfl players at heart and that played a large role in building our league to the prominence it enjoys today my prayers and the prayers of the washington redskins organization go out to his family at this sad time
6530271 on behalf of the philadelphia eagles i am very saddened and shocked to learn of gene upshaws passing this morning whether it was as a hall of fame offensive lineman with the oakland raiders or as executive director of the nfl players association gene was a tremendous leader and a wonderful person gene always believed the best way to build the popularity of our sport was to craft a dynamic partnership between the players and the owners that served the best interest of the fans we as well as the entire nfl family will miss his presence dearly and our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife terri and their three sons
6530272 i would like to extend my deepest condolences to the family and friends of gene upshaw he was a giant in the nfl since entering the league in 1967 first as a hall of fame offensive lineman then as an active member of the collective bargaining process in the late 1970s and early 1980s and finally as the executive director of the nflpa gene continually served in the best interests of the game of football he played a colossal role in the success the nfl enjoys today even more than many people realize
6530273 we were all saddened to learn of gene upshaws passing i have great respect for genes unprecedented hall of fame career i also admired gene upshaw the union leader for his leadership intelligence and partnership during his 25 year career with the nfl players association most importantly i admired gene upshaw the person he was a true gentleman and his contributions to our great game first as a high character highly skilled player and later as the head of the players union will never be forgotten i extend my prayers for a wonderful man a hero of the nfl and the entire falcons family extends its deepest condolences to genes wife terri and to his sons justin daniel and eugene jr
6530274 we at the green bay packers today were saddened to learn of the passing of gene upshaw gene was a hall of fame player who very much appreciated the game and all its traditions and history through his leadership on behalf of the players he helped to strengthen the game and grow the popularity and success it enjoys today personally i owe a lot to gene i had the chance to work with him first as a player representative and then he gave me a start with the players association as an assistant executive director in 1985 after my playing career had ended i was impressed that he always had the best interests of the game in the forefront even though he remained a strong advocate for the players at the end of the day he always wanted to do what was right for the game he treated the players with dignity and they had great respect for him given his stature as a hall of famer and all of his accomplishments in more than 40 years of nfl involvement our thoughts and prayers are with his family
6530275 in his position representing the players i felt like gene was always very frank and fair when he came in and visited the club
6530276 he doesnt do it much but hes the best blitzer on the team
6530277 when hes focused and tuned in he really could be the teams best backer like tatupu said he was recently but the key is for leroy to keep the switch on all the time the guy is also just a flat out great tackler
6530278 reports that actor jean reno is in the hospital due to a heart attack are false he is vacationing in the caribbean and went to a local hospital as a precaution for some discomfort he was feeling due to heartburn and gastroenteritis it was definitely not a heart attack he is fine and healthy and enjoying the rest of his vacation traveling in the caribbean

6530386 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6530387 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6530388 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6530389 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6530390 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6530391 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6530392 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6530393 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6530394 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6530395 i cant imagine a world without genes larger than life presence
6530396 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6530397 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6530398 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6530399 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6530400 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union
6530401 he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players playing alongside of gene was an honor and a privilege he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams

6530418 elles auront besoin denviron 10 jours pour quitter les positions quelles occupent en colonnes et passer dans lordre sur le territoire de la russie via loss tie du sud
6530419 le retrait doit avoir lieu et il doit avoir lieu maintenant
6530420 ce dont nous sommes certains cest que le retrait nest pas tr s rapide sil a r ellement commenc
6530421 we studied the properties of disease causing viruses that evolved to infect mucosal surfaces to engineer a coating that enables our drug delivery particles to penetrate mucus layers in minutes in our new work we have improved the coatings considerably to allow faster penetration for a wider array of particle sizes
6530422 for example we constantly inhale particles into our lungs but they typically stick to mucus rather than penetrate it particles that stick are removed rapidly from the lungs on a mucus conveyor belt and are swallowed and sterilized in the gut mucus barriers protect us from constant infection as well as everyday things like the millions of particles in the black cloud emitted from a bus when it takes off from a stop
6530423 the government also appears to be aware of the fact that it needs to remove capital controls in order to improve its investment profile and rating
6530424 the government is warming to the idea of gradually lifting the capital controls as the peso continues to depreciate and pressures from the exporting community to maintain existing controls fall
6530425 unless significant improvements in the relevant capital flow restrictions are observed
6530426 the government will be carefully monitoring the pesos performance over the next few months and will only move to relax and eventually dismantle capital controls once the peso begins to trade consistently at what they consider to be a sustainable rate of 2000 pesos to the dollar or above
6530427 instead here is a case where processing is positive in terms of enhancing absorption of lycopene
6530428 what we have found is we can take the red tomato molecular form of lycopene and by processing it and heating it in combination with added oil we can change the shape of the molecule so it is configured in this bent form
6530429 some people like to cook tomato sauce for prolonged periods sometimes reheating it day after day because it tastes better on the second and third day they add fat by using oil or meat and thats going to start to induce cis isomers of lycopene if fat is present and the cooking continues
6530430 so its possible people could induce this process and increase lycopene absorption by routine food preparation procedures as well

6530462 with the economy heading south during recessions the conventional wisdom is that stock prices drop as well stocks usually drop before a recession something that may be happening now however the market tends to look ahead and starts to respond favorably to the expected end of a recession long before it occurs influential economist donald luskin of trend macrolytics recently ran the numbers and found that stocks have produced an average return of 12 1 percent in post world war ii recessions this is only slightly below the average return outside recessions

6530466 the fcc has required them to disclose all the details so we look forward to seeing that before we can fully evaluate any move that doesnt involve blocking consumers access to the internet is a positive step but we wont know for sure about this particular practice until we see the details
6530467 we looked very very carefully at the research result and we found that high quality early education can make a huge difference
6530468 i think we can cut this cycle of violence by introducing kids to learning at a much earlier age
6530469 we believe that high quality pre kindergarten education is something that is critical and that exposure to that kind of learning that friendly atmosphere that loving and caring atmosphere is something they are more than likely missing in their personal lives

6530481 i think its safe to say that msu is truly trying to be a green campus
6530482 across campus students staff and faculty are taking steps to reduce our ecological footprint housing and food services physical plant research teams faculty in the classroom and student leaders are making a difference
6530483 they speak about it plan for it hire staff to support it and the campuses they lead are steadily becoming greener models for the wider society
6530484 what did i tell you about opening this door for strangers
6530485 lots of people dont believe i do this from the first floor
6530486 the camera cut you out of the shot all weve got is your voice were going to have to do this in the living room
6530487 people are starting to accuse me of selling out because i have sponsors and stuff now but what do they know ive got to make a living right
6530488 but you know i almost made the deadspin hall of fame last year thats an awesome site
6530489 the record in this case compels the conclusion that kingsbridges failure to make timely payments to the funds an unfair labor practice which in turn resulted in the termination of their health coverage provided substantial motivation for the employees to go on strike
6530490 white fat cells are the conventional form of fat designed to store energy by contrast the main role of brown fat is to burn calories by generating heat brown fat cells largely disappear by adulthood in humans but their precursors still remain the body
6530491 as we learn more about the controls of brown fat development medical interventions to increase energy expenditure by brown fat inducing agents such as bmp 7 may provide hope to these individuals in losing weight and preventing the metabolic disorders associated with obesity
6530492 problems with the use of sizing of graduated compression stockings are common throughout the country and this study is one of the first to systematically analyze the problems and recommend ways to improve practice
6530493 based on the study findings we recommend that knee length stockings be the standard length used and that the education of nurses and patients about the proper use of stockings be improved
6530494 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
6530495 the fact that these results occurred in genetically obese animals offers hope that this drug could potentially treat severe obesity
6530496 this would appear to be true even if the obesity results from binge eating as this disorder is characterized by eating patterns that are similar to drug taking patterns in those with cocaine dependency
6530497 these findings provide further evidence that the health system is falling short of where it needs to be to ensure health and economic security
6530498 we need a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance available
6530499 what is notable is how this is spreading up the income scale
6530500 even adults with insurance reported problems in getting needed care
6530501 even in 2007 when the economic slow down hadnt really taken hold you found that 29 percent of those with medical bill problems or accrued medical debt reported being unable to pay for basic necessities like food heat rent
6530502 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people tweaking its taste could encourage a calcium deficient population to consume more of this key nutrient
6530503 by understanding how calcium is detected in the mouth we can either make it easier to consume by reducing its bad taste or even make pharmacological agents that make it taste better
6530504 professional sports stadiums are another place where theres a great likelihood of illegal alcohol sales
6530505 we know that we have problems with fans drinking too much and contributing to problems in and around stadiums we need to make sure we prevent these illegal sales from occurring
6530506 i would imagine these vendors are under quite a bit of pressure trying to not block the views of others trying to pay attention
6530507 they dont have the time or proximity to buyers to make observations necessary to avoid making an illegal sale
6530508 you just have to attend a sports event to see that some fans drink too much and spoil the event for others through loud disruptive and drunken behavior
6530509 limiting serving to the booths could make drinkers walk and stand on line between drinks cutting down the number they consume
6530510 brick and mortar retailers are at a disadvantage right now because they have to charge sales tax on purchases and internet retailers dont
6530511 the law was introduced as a way to close the tax loophole
6530512 eight of the top 10 online retailers already collect tax on their sales such as wal mart and other companies with physical stores in new york
6530513 if somebody wants to come out and do a 1 33 theres probably nothing i can do about it
6530514 thats the good and the bad at the same time about our sport is that youre in your own lane its not a combative sport i cant reach over and knock the guy over if he starts going faster than me all i can do is try to go as fast as i can
6530515 he and his coach have prepared for this since athens finished and hes ready to go
6530516 if you have had preeclampsia you should be aware that you are at increased risk for renal and cardiovascular disease and you should try to reduce that risk
6530517 historically the thought was that after delivery everything was fine but preeclampsia isnt benign and it may initiate a cascade of damage that takes years to develop into clinically relevant renal disease
6530518 the take home message from this study is that any young woman who has had any variant of preeclampsia and eclampsia needs to be monitored for ongoing or recurrent diabetes
6530519 indeed the likelihood that chronic renal failure did not develop even among women with three previous episodes of preeclampsia was greater than 99 percent
6530520 its critical that doctors and patients understand that there is now a linkage between preeclampsia and esrd for women whove had preeclampsia this is a reason to increase your sensitivity to healthy living and not add to your risk keep your weight down avoid
6530521 we found that the odor profile coming from the skin of skin cancer patients was markedly different than that coming from healthy skin
6530522 so we think that this kind of biomarker could be used in a rapid and noninvasive way to detect skin cancer
6530523 and this would be novel because now the only way to do so is with a visual exam and a biopsy which is of course invasive
6530524 but i think within a few years its reasonable to say that this could end up being a diagnostic tool that would be a routine thing one could do in a doctors office its a real possibility
6530525 in terms of this replacing the standard method we have of diagnosing skin cancer which is basically to look at a specimen under the microscope its hard to imagine this would do it completely
6530526 because when youre dealing with cancer the margin for error is really small you dont want to miss something that may be a cancer that then doesnt get treated and you dont want to treat someone for cancer if they actually have something else so its really a very novel and interesting idea but one which i think really needs to be further researched and carefully confirmed
6530527 when you put all of the information together there is no evidence that statins increase the risk of cancer
6530528 this study should reassure those taking statins that they are not increasing their risk of cancer by trying to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease
6530529 statin therapy despite producing marked reductions in ldl cholesterol is not associated with an increased risk of cancer
6530530 we really should be targeting and prioritizing the younger girls 12 year olds prior to sexual activity
6530531 we used mathematical models to simulate the natural history of the disease
6530532 then superimposed these strategies whether they be screening hpv vaccine or a combination of both
6530533 we found the vaccine up to the age of 18 was consistently favorable
6530534 up to age 21 was favorable under generous assumptions about its efficacy up to age 26 was consistently unattractive in terms of cost effectiveness
6530535 the bad news is that the overall effect of the vaccines on cervical cancer remains unknown
6530536 but its a very interesting concept and we should definitely go on doing controlled research and see if this is going to work
6530537 we are vaccinating young girls and we are going to see the effect in a couple of decades
6530538 vaccine duration is the critical parameter to determine if hpv vaccination is cost effective
6530539 we have to educate girls and women that the vaccine must be used with the current screening system and is not a substitute for lifetime continued pap screening
6530540 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
6530541 reproductive dysfunctions include a range of menstrual disorders sexual dysfunctions and
6530542 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
6530543 if drinking continues or increases to levels of problem use their ability and or opportunity to have children may be impaired
6530544 for women who are already experiencing fertility problems or other reproductive difficulties the studys findings should warn them not to use alcohol to cope with stress caused by the reproductive problems because alcohol would likely make the reproductive problems worse as well as carrying risks of possible alcohol abuse or dependence
6530545 this was a short term study without placebo so it shows that a longer term trial should be done
6530546 we are planning a larger long term study that will be international in the united states and canada and also in europe
6530547 we selected the best ones did chemistry to modify them and came up with ptc124
6530548 i think she did the absolute right thing and she did it the right way
6530549 she underwent lumpectomy and then when she got the information back from the genetic testing she was able to have a little time to discern what this all meant and then she went forward to have the prophylactic mastectomies which are clearly the best treatment to reduce her risk of ever developing breast cancer again by at least 90
6530550 it may not be right for every patient but i think especially if you have this genetic mutation its such a highly active mutation in terms of increasing the risk of breast cancer that its certainly something that i would recommend to one of my family members or to my patients and i do
6530551 because her risk of an additional breast cancer is extremely high in the range of one in two why take a chance
6530552 smart because life is too short its not worth living your life worrying every six months when you have to go back for tests and more tests and hoping that its not going to come back with this way you really increase your chances of not having to worry about it again and live your life
6530553 when youre in the operating room its not like you can look and say all that yellow tissue is breast tissue and all that white tissue is fat so you try and take all the tissue out that you can but you can leave isolated breast cells underneath the skin everybody does theres not a surgeon in the world that can do that and remove all of the cells thats why there is a small risk of having a breast cancer develop in one of those cells pretty uncommon but it can happen
6530554 i offer it to all of my patients and if i think theres a reason why they shouldnt get it from a medical perspective then i explain why i think its advisable to delay the reconstruction but they should at least have that conversation with their surgeons
6530555 it is a difficult decision and an emotional decision and it is not that simple to decide to lose your breast
6530556 such a part of being a woman so there were a lot of emotional factors
6530557 be able to live my life peacefully and life goes on
6530558 they just dont want to look at themselves its an extremely difficult experience
6530559 i never really had a problem with that only because i knew what that was going to be like
6530560 dont have to worry about potential problems related to the implant
6530561 are like a salt water balloon thats put underneath the muscle
6530562 it takes a long time until you finally have your final result
6530563 i just made it like an educational opportunity we never know what the patients go through when they leave
6530564 the majority of patients dont go the whole 9 yards
6530565 most of them do the first step many of them never come back to have the nipple and areola reconstructed they are just tired and they have had enough
6530566 she is an actress and may be more aware of her body
6530567 if a patient is expecting to be happy because shes alive shes going to be happier than the patient who puts as the most important thing her appearance and may be disappointed because what she sees is not what she pictured
6530568 we do expect you to be able with clothing on to look normal without having to have prostheses
6530569 but if the expectation is for the breast to feel normal and to look absolutely normal in front of the mirror without any cover on it this is probably not going to be the case
6530570 i was very concerned about my cleavage i talked to my surgeons and made sure that i kept it
6530571 da it jim im a doctor not a computer programmer
6530572 real programmers just throw a bunch of 1s and 0s at the computer to see what sticks
6530573 real programmers just throw a bunch of 1s and 0s at the computer to see what sticks
6530574 our methods have the potential of providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on also the effectiveness of early preventative drug therapies can be better assessed with these methods
6530575 ninety five percent of the worlds supply were picking up

6530579 do you really think my applebees menu is going to say artisan bread
6530580 the 400 has definitely been dominated by the u s for a long time
6530581 i was going to get out and use what i had

6530583 when i came off the turn i was in good position
6530584 when i tried to move it just wasnt there for some reason
6530585 sometimes weve got to sacrifice our bodies our minds and our spirit for what we really want

6530597 we are examining the order and are evaluating our options
6530598 if congress had wanted us to regulate internet network management it would have said so explicitly in the statue
6530599 in other words if the fcc already possessed the authority to do this why have bills been introduced giving us the authority we ostensibly already had

6530604 proprio vero che il tema della giustizia costituisce un nervo scoperto per una parte della sinistra daltra parte non appena aprono bocca alcuni magistrati come cascini e ingroia mettono in evidenza la loro estrema politicizzazione
6530605 berlusconi ha parlato del problema della riforma della giustizia non vi si pu rispondere come fa cascini evocando il fascismo n dandogli lezioni di lotta alla mafia come fa in modo saccente ingroia per altro molto pi taciturno e sobrio al tempo del governo di centro sinistra malgrado che su questo terreno lattuale governo con il ministro alfano abbia gi fatto cose molto significative
6530606 we want to present the best value we can to consumers and to our retail and food service partners but we need to be ultimately able to cover the cost were confronted with
6530607 we are taking aggressive action in food service that included reduced expectations in our full year forecast
6530608 its a good global strategy and a good example of what a u s based food company ought to be doing in order to maintain balance growth in this pretty turbulent food economy
6530609 look the wages you failed to pay the workmen who mowed your fields are crying out against you the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the lord almighty you have lived on earth in luxury and self indulgence you have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter you have condemned and murdered innocent men who were not opposing you
6530610 leaders need to understand that when the lord gave us twenty four hours in a day he gave us all the time we need to do what he is calling us to do so if you are as a leader are frazzled by busyness it is time to examine closely the priorities of your life if jesus gives us enough time to do his will then being overly busy is suspect
6530611 look here you who say today or tomorrow we are going to a certain town and will stay there a year
6530612 if the lord want us to we will live and do this or that
6530613 see how the lilies of the field grow they do not labor or spin
6530614 current economic environment is difficult and the mid market home sector has been particularly hard hit when the middle market recovers we will consider future publication of home
6530615 it is difficult to close a magazine particularly when it means that some of our colleagues positions will be affected
6530616 the established authority for renovation and design enthusiasts and provides our nearly 3 5 million readers with a solid foundation of knowledge about products and price points that empowers them to make informed purchasing decisions
6530617 when people do less buying and selling of homes and less remodeling there is less need for the advertising categories that support the businesses to spend their money
6530618 why didnt you come to me sooner i could have helped i would have fought this battle for you now come let me give you the victory
6530619 we have these fake queues at front of 20 stores around the country to drum up interest in the iphone
6530620 some people are wealthy and rich in their lives and their children and their ability to educate them others are poor if theyre billionares
6530621 first you make us fat with your inarguably fantastic cross media approach to infiltrating our lives with everything the king then you turn around and sell us a book explaining how weve been tricked into being fat
6530622 just so you know hooplanetics is already out for those who had the brains to figure it out it was secretly bound inside the back cover of the hoopla book check out the scissor line clue around the naked man oh and by the way what friends of yours worked at cp b and what do you know about alex b im guessing you dont even know him enough to make a judgment good luck
6530623 do you know think i will take care of you
6530624 therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear is not life more important than food and the body more important than clothes
6530625 and why do you worry about clothes see how the lilies of the field grow they do not labor or spin

6530830 although the public does not always rule it is often able to move or maintain government policies in desired directions
6530831 i am going to say something that few people in public life will say but most know is absolutely true a vast aspect of our jobs today is coping with the media its sheer scale weight and constant hyperactivity
6530832 roy was beaten up in jail before he was found not guilty at the old bailey yet the woman who lied and called him a rapist walks away i just want my sons name to be properly cleared
6530833 you will here the degree of pain she experienced her face was hurting and her eyes swollen as he continued to assault her throughout the incident
6530834 women did not create the glass ceiling the invisible barrier blamed for limiting their ability to earn what theyre worth but they help maintain it
6530835 being able to draw attention to your contributions and competencies at work has become an important part of modern career management and it is something most women are still unwilling or unable to do as consistently as their male counterparts
6530836 they believe hard work alone is sufficient to put them on salary and status par with their male counterparts
6530837 good work is important but good work alone does not as the myth says speak for itself you have to give it a voice
6530838 this led many women in the study to actually prefer male managers to female managers claiming men are more consistent and fair minded than women
6530839 we dont want it to be a free for all
6530840 los dos ltimos a os no hemos ganado nada y ste no podemos volver a fallar en la liga tenemos que ganarla por nuestra afici n
6530841 lo importante no es la calidad sino el trabajo y el sacrificio
6530842 s puede ser una posibilidad muy importante para m de iniciar un partido y estoy muy motivado por esa situaci n
6530843 bien poco a poco ir agarrando mi ritmo porque si han pasado fechas que por ah no he participado he entrenado muy bien f sicamente me siento muy bien y si se da la oportunidad de jugar creo que estoy preparado

6530846 m s que ansiedad yo creo que es el deseo de querer estar ah para eso entreno para jugar los fines de semana y yo creo que si se puede dar esta semana
6530847 s te digo yo llevo tiempo aqu en veracruz me ha costado mucho trabajo ser titular ahora es un torneo nuevo y con cosas nuevas y hay que comenzar de cero y otra vez si me toca estar ah yo creo que me siento capaz para estar en la cancha
6530848 ser ambicioso e ir a por el partido con el objetivo de consolidar la imagen ofrecida en el encuentro de ida y evitar que esa imagen se convierta en un espejismo
6530849 debemos ir con la mentalidad de que tenemos opciones reales de ganar la supercopa
6530850 cualquiera de los de arriba tiene calidad suficiente para ganar la final
6530851 hay que dar pasos peque os y seguros porque no hay que olvidar que venimos del abismo ahora tenemos la posibilidad de ganar un t tulo y comenzar la liga cargados de confianza
6530852 ha de saber cuando vender a sus jugadores y es mejor hacer el esfuerzo para que ellos se queden convencidos comprometidos y con ilusi n que salir fuera a comprar jugadores de sus caracter sticas
6530853 se le da m s importancia de la que tiene
6530854 lo m s importante no es quien lleva el brazalete sino quien da la cara por el equipo en los momentos complicados lo importante es que la persona que lleve el brazalete est respaldado por el vestuario
6530855 estoy preparado para continuar desde que llegu aqu lo hice para hacer el trabajo que estoy haciendo
6530856 forma parte del futbol hay momentos de alegr a y momentos de tristeza y hay que vivir con los dos
6530857 en el futbol nosotros siempre queremos lo mejor ser el n mero uno lo m ximo posible
6530858 si todos los que vienen a las olimpiadas se llevasen una medalla ser a fant stico
6530859 pero en futbol uno nunca se queda satisfecho como aficionado hay que ser el mejor
6530860 brasil fue cinco veces campeona del mundo pero como le falta ese oro ol mpico el nico trofeo futbol stico que se le ha resistido hasta la fecha qu queremos hacer se insiste e insiste con el oro y ahora parece que no hemos ganado cinco veces la copa del mundo que no se tiene una historia
6530861 todo el mundo ya pas por esta situaci n aqu en la selecci n cuando se pierde el entrenador es culpable
6530862 ah se ve la importancia del futbol cuando se gana se habla poco cuando se pierde entonces es una cuesti n nacional ah est la gran importancia que tiene el futbol en brasil y en el mundo
6530863 fuimos a la copa am rica 2007 y ganamos y en la olimp ada no conseguimos el oro pero vamos a intentar el bronce y a dar seguimiento a nuestro trabajo
6530864 ahora no necesito y nunca voy a necesitar gracias a dios adular a nadie
6530865 con la derrota o con la victoria tengo la misma cara no cambia nada
6530866 honradez moral coraz n bondad ser transparente no ser una figura ni un personaje hay que ser un hombre tanto a la hora de ganar como de perder
6530867 creo que tengo que continuar el trabajo como lo vengo haciendo hasta ahora
6530868 i have to admit nothing quite makes your asshole picker like paying around with live hand grenades
6530869 and they have a lot of ammunitions left over from the vietnam war and their own civil strife and thats how the army makes money you go down to the army bases there and they give you training courses on how to fire military weapons and one of the places down there in cambodia phnom penh they also had grenades there well wouldnt you take a course on how to throw grenades i did anyway
6530870 that was under the instruction of a bunch of military officers you know i admit it i just did an article with sandra thomas from the vancouver courier and during the hour long conversation i never once mentioned guns or firearms and yet she peppered the entire thing with references to guns and firearms it is one of my sports but its not my entire life the media seems to grab onto this and make such a big stink same with sharon about guns
6530871 what can i say you dont have to publish it but if youre going to be an asshole youre going to ruin my political career and of course im going to really appreciate that
6530872 he is now being placed under strict conditions on parole until completion of his sentence
6530873 it is clear that those who are rich and white will continue to be treated differently to those who are poor
6530874 we today can tell the whole world tskhinvali is a hero city what i saw today was stalingrad if it wasnt for help from great russia there would have been even more casualties
6530875 the heroes our brothers and sisters savagely murdered by the bloody aggressor
6530876 we have earnt the right to live in a free republic
6530877 the west and united states have an interest in georgia as a country through which an oil pipeline lies and want to push russian influence out of the caucasus
6530878 we have these fake queues at front of 20 stores around the country to drum up interest in the iphone
6530879 fueron muchas preguntas repetitivas pero como no tenemos nada que temer las contestamos las veces que sean necesarios
6530880 confirmar el primer diagn stico y decidir c mo y cu ndo se opera ya que el quir fano es pr cticamente inevitable en este tipo de lesiones as como un largo per odo de baja
6530881 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6530882 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6530883 the rudd government should bring in its main legislation to overturn the howard governments ir laws as soon as possible
6530884 in recent weeks there has been clear evidence that telstra rio tinto cochlear and other major companies are still exploiting the laws
6530885 while it remained behind the coalition as the preferred party on these issues its disadvantage was small and many more voters saw no difference between the major parties
6530886 there were clearly many factors that contributed to the australian labor partys 2007 election success but one was the partys increasing credibility with voters on national security issues
6530887 creo que no va a ser f cil ellos est n trabajando tambi n pero nosotros tenemos que imponer nuestro ritmo hacer lo que hicimos ante monterrey y creo que tenemos las condiciones para obtener los tres puntos
6530888 en el entrenamiento hemos trabajado y enfatizado mucho en la parte ofensiva desde el primer minuto hay que empezar con todo salir a ganar y si marcamos el gol entre los primeros diez o quince minutos podemos administrar para ir por la victoria
6530889 estoy m s confiado el primer gol ya cay y el segundo tambi n fue un partido dif cil y estoy tranquilo estoy muy contento las cosas est n saliendo bien y el gol sale naturalmente creo que el viernes tendr oportunidades para marcar
6530890 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6530891 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6530892 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6530893 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6530894 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6530895 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6530896 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6530897 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6530898 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6530899 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6530900 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6530901 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6530902 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6530903 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6530904 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6530905 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6530906 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6530907 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6530908 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6530909 peta wants me to spend my days sucking on celery stalks the only time i want celery is when its in a bloody mary and the only time i want a bloody mary is when ive already ordered a bacon and cheese omelet i want meat im not a fruit bat
6530910 there is no rational basis for saying a human has special rights
6530911 hey you threw paint on my fur coat point taken
6530912 she offered a firm handshake americans didnt give the nazi salute but hitler offered a firm grope
6530913 and he begins to squeeze and pinch and hug me up and he said youre a true aryan type
6530914 here things like virtualization and web services and cloud computing come into play and all of these uses have no problem keeping two four six or more cores busy
6530915 this is the area well likely see dunnington make the most impact
6530916 a better process enables higher transistor counts larger caches and more cores ultimately the cores will impact performance more but the larger caches will help as well
6530917 going from four to six cores will see close to the 50 percent improvement linear scaling with a little slowdown due to i o contention
6530918 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6530919 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6530920 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6530921 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6530922 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6530923 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6530924 this is a planning took where all things are going
6530925 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6530926 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6530927 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6530928 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6530929 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6530930 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6530931 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6530932 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6530933 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6530934 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6530935 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6530936 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6530937 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6530938 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6530939 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6530940 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6530941 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6530942 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6530943 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6530944 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6530945 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6530946 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6530947 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6530948 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6530949 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6530950 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6530951 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6530952 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6530953 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6530954 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6530955 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6530956 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6530957 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6530958 we today can tell the whole world tskhinvali is a hero city what i saw today was stalingrad if it wasnt for help from great russia there would have been even more casualties
6530959 the heroes our brothers and sisters savagely murdered by the bloody aggressor
6530960 we have earnt the right to live in a free republic
6530961 the west and united states have an interest in georgia as a country through which an oil pipeline lies and want to push russian influence out of the caucasus
6530962 as a result many western leaders close their eyes to the fact georgia has killed civilians in south ossetia
6530963 initiated a genocide probe based on reports of actions committed by georgian troops aimed at murdering russian citizens ethnic ossetians living in south ossetia
6530964 i have a lot of problems with the way this loan was written
6530965 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6530966 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6530967 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6530968 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6530969 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6530970 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6530971 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6530972 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6530973 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6530974 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6530975 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6530976 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6530977 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6530978 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6530979 yeah but well probably never see this released will we
6530980 the industry indicated that these guidelines actually suited their needs because what they want to prove is a couple of successful opportunities and then hope that one of those investors is able to take it to a commercial demonstration plant which then will encourage the private sector to further invest in the industry
6530981 all the judges on the original panel have voted to deny the petition
6530982 none of the judges in regular active service has requested a vote on the petition for rehearing en banc
6530983 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6530984 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6530985 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6530986 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6530987 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6530988 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6530989 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6530990 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6530991 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6530992 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6530993 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6530994 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6530995 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6530996 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6530997 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6530998 team usa argentina rivalry started with a dunk on kg
6530999 peacekeepers all russian forces would return to russian territory by the end of friday
6531000 we have received formal notifications via military channels that russia has decided to halt international military cooperation events until further notice
6531001 nato is much more in need of russias support of its military actions in afghanistan where natos fate appears to be in the balance
6531002 everything depends on nato priorities the priority is for unconditional support of georgian president mikheil saakashvili then we wont be to blame for the bankrupting of the alliances relations with russia
6531003 notified by the georgian side that there would be an invasion but did not warn russian peacekeepers
6531004 we understand the essence of the russian position and its military response we believe russia was responding to the georgian provocation
6531005 i will be a pro life president and my administration will have pro life policies
6531006 the one thing i cant do laura and ill talk about anything you want to but the process that were in
6531007 i cant talk about it because if i do i would get down a slippery slope
6531008 the media is making a mistake trying to narrow the issue of vp selection to pro choice or pro life
6531009 that is a vast over simplification typical of the punditry the public will fit the selection into a much broader context that is what the mccain campaign is correctly focused on how the running mate fits into the context of their campaign
6531010 one should not consider mccains potential decision to select a pro choice running mate as an effort to re brand the party the party is pro life and we generate a significant amount of enthusiasm among the rank and file based on that issue position rather mccain picking a pro choice running mate has only to do with his effort to win election not to re brand the party
6531011 generate a significant amount of enthusiasm among the rank and file
6531012 why the hell is mitt romney not the leading candidate for president in this country
6531013 and how empty and phony do you have to be to not do well in such an interview
6531014 while mccain has built his political reputation on his willingness to go against his own party
6531015 the world is waking up to the fact that every molecule of energy that passes into europe is now controlled by a belligerent russia
6531016 obamas got a lot of ground to make up following that performance last weekend at the saddleback presidential forum with pastor rick warren
6531017 im pro infanticide i love sunsets and i dont get the 13th amendment
6531018 well actually my experience in foreign policy is probably more diverse than most others in the field im somebody who has actually lived overseas somebody who has studied overseas i majored in international relations
6531019 because historically because historically we have not defined marriage in our constitution
6531020 and you saw how well that goes over with the rick warren people
6531021 aspergirl please believe us when we say that we would never dream of taking you seriously
6531022 some believe that mccain wants to completely overhaul the definition of what it means to be a republican
6531023 some believe that mccain wants to completely overhaul the definition of what it means to be a republican
6531024 es importante que la calidad del jugador de chivas se manifieste jugando cuando no se manifieste jugando que la ayuda sea en la banca o cuando se le necesite porque el jugador de chivas est preparado para jugar o entrar de cambio fue aceptable su accionar
6531025 jug con salcido que lo conoce bien con rafael m rquez y dem s as que pese a que no juega en europa se mostr como todo un europeo eriksson hizo lo recomendable en este caso creo que el sistema que emple los jugadores que puso al servicio de ese sistema era lo ideal que se necesitaba para que ese sistema diera frutos ya que todos los jugadores europeos juegan bajo ese sistema
6531026 estamos hablando de rafael m rquez ricardo osorio carlos salcido andr s guardado de hecho el mismo fernando arce porque aunque juega en santos est jugando con dos l neas de cuatro entonces creo que emple a los jugadores adecuados para el sistema que ten a preparado
6531027 es normal por el entendimiento a un sistema de juego se vio un equipo con personalidad ya estamos viendo jugadores con un nivel importante creo que con el tiempo la selecci n con ese tipo de jugadores ser muy fuerte
6531028 tengo referencias de ellos del perfil de sus jugadores de d nde juegan y si le agregamos que honduras siempre se nos complica el partido no era f cil nunca lo pens pero fue m s sufrido de lo que cre
6531029 nosotros no damos por concluido el conflicto hasta que el tema de los d as ca dos no se aclare ni se resuelva por lo tanto nosotros estamos en alerta y movilizaci n y saldr de las escuelas cual es el mandato de que se va hacer
6531030 la propuesta que hace el ministerio de educaci n sobre los d as ca dos no es una salida did ctica para que el alumno recupere el tiempo de clases que perdi
6531031 lo que el ministerio de educaci n propone es un castigo al docente que hizo paro lo que nosotros decimos es aquel alumno que encuentra alguna dificultad por los d as perdidos los pueda recuperar una salida pedag gica
6531032 de otro modo no se puede entender el pedido de las autoridades educativas que piden al sindicato que haga un listado de los docentes que adhirieron el paro y que remitan una planificaci n de como se recuperan los d as perdidos
6531033 educaci n propone destac que sean los d as s bados pero esto es impracticable porque no se sabe cu l de las trece materias se decide recuperar
6531034 we had a chat about his future and what were doing and hell announce that when hes ready to do it wont be long
6531035 just listen to i never loved a man aretha was the only black person in the room yet there never was a funkier record made that confounds every theory of racial purity in the book
6531036 it is as if she is the real daughter i am also a real daughter
6531037 dave blackwells career has been based on collecting heat flow data hes done this for 40 years
6531038 but there are parts of the country that have never been researched in detail whether by dave or other researchers in the geothermal community this is an opportunity for the geothermal industry via smu to collect data in places where there is virtually no data
6531039 enhanced geothermal systems could be the killer app of the energy world
6531040 it has the potential to deliver vast quantities of power 24 7 and be captured nearly anywhere on the planet and it would be a perfect complement to intermittent sources like solar and wind
6531041 this is a law that is routinely evaded it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
6531042 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
6531043 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
6531044 as the mother of a daughter who is close to entering college it is deeply disappointing to me that many of our educational leaders would support an initiative without doing their homework on the underlying research and science
6531045 parents should think twice before sending their teens to these colleges or any others that have waved the white flag on underage and binge drinking policies
6531046 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
6531047 real men goes the unwritten rule of american punctuation dont use semi colons
6531048 clearly men find the em dash a reassuring phallic symbol while the semicolon reawakens their freudian castration anxiety what better way to cope with penis envy than to make frequent use of the semicolon
6531049 seems to me theyre arguing that complex thoughts and nuanced self expression are chick things
6531050 wait and the top 10 most ridiculous undergarments worn by women in video games top 10 80s movie moments we once loved but now see in a different and more disturbing light
6531051 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event

6531126 well ive actually been approved by the government to play a show
6531127 ive already sold 10 000 tickets there so i will be going to put on a concert for the fans
6531128 they tend to you know sometimes not want western artists in their country
6531129 i respect that but at the same time you know theres people that listen to music there and want to see their idols and stuff so its all good been approved by the government and im going to go put on a show and have fun
6531130 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6531131 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6531132 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6531133 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time
6531134 our music now is not representing the times at least not socially and politically or maybe were just distracted
6531135 these musicians speak to millions of people every day so for them to use their voices to inspire people is a key part of our program
6531136 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
6531137 i think were looking at the last generation of consoles theres not going to be an xbox 720 or a ps4 ill make that bet not going to happen
6531138 i made several observations about the console business and why it would be strategic for microsoft at that time whats interesting is that the assumptions that got microsoft into the game business are also reasons why i think consoles may be at an end
6531139 the era of consoles defined by graphics and high production values is over
6531140 sony and microsoft took the bet that prettier graphics would be the huge differentiating feature for their consoles they were wrong everybody expects things to look good so making it look 10 per cent better doesnt have a big impact on its value since thats changed we now live in an era where community defines the value of a game not production values so the community dynamics of an mmo are more valuable to a user than how good the graphics look
6531141 when consoles came along and matched them for graphic capabilities it destroyed that differentiator for the arcade business the only arcade machines you can find left today are ones based on big input controllers which are expensive to put into the home dance pads steering wheels guns
6531142 these musicians speak to millions of people every day so for them to use their voices to inspire people is a key part of our program
6531143 oh but we really liked et so that counts right

6531149 in all honesty integrating kratos into hot shots golf was by far one of the best experiences as we got to work closely with the team and the cast of characters voice over animators etc that created kratos in his original form
6531150 if i had to pick one of the most fun parts it would have to be our vo sessions and watching listening to t c carson jump into the kratos role in a completely new environment trust me there were plenty of eye watering side splitting laughs that day

6531156 even with the best preparation sometimes things dont go well
6531157 i dont think id change anything four of five days id have a good competition with the preparation i did
6531158 ive experienced the top level of competition not that other ones are easier or less difficult but this gives you a different perspective for sure
6531159 i see another child tonight he hears the train go by at night and he dreams of far away places where hed like to go it seems like an impossible dream but he is helped on his journey through life a father who had to go to work before he finished the sixth grade sacrificed everything he had so that his sons could go to college a gentle quaker mother with a passionate concern for peace quietly wept when he went to war but she understood why he had to go a great teacher a remarkable football coach an inspirational minister encouraged him on his way a courageous wife and loyal children stood by him in victory and also defeat and in his chosen profession of politics first there were scores then hundreds then thousands and finally millions worked for his success and tonight he stands before you nominated for president of the united states of america you can see why i believe so deeply in the american dream

6531273 the detention of the yemeni christians not only violates their human rights but also exposes them for further human rights violations like torture and even extrajudicial killings yemeni authorities should fulfill their obligations under international human rights law by releasing the chrisians and respecting the freedom of their citizens to follow the religion of their choice
6531274 the united states sells nearly one half of its annual soybean crop abroad in the form of soybeans soybean oil soybean meal and livestock products said asa president
6531275 accordingly asa has historically supported trade agreements as the best way to open global markets to exports of u s products
6531276 u s agricultural exports contributed nearly 90 billion to total u s exports in 2007 and soybeans and soy products accounted for more than 12 billion of those exports
6531277 mexico and canada are our first and second largest markets for soybean meal
6531278 mexico is also our second largest market for u s soybeans and soybean oil
6531279 reopening or renegotiating these markets would erode the benefits u s producers and consumers are enjoying
6531280 this will result in lost sales and revenue that u s farmers cannot afford
6531281 we are prepared to see trade distorting farm support programs reduced to enhance trade liberalization
6531282 however importing nations with high tariffs on agricultural products particularly developing countries must take comparable steps to opening their markets to u s exports
6531283 in this regard asa was not satisfied with the status of the doha trade negotiations at the time they were suspended earlier this month and supports the united states refusal to accept an unbalanced outcome
6531284 we know that farmers want to receive their income from the market as they currently do
6531285 we also know that markets are cyclical and that a responsible safety net is essential in times of low prices or low yields
6531286 asa also strongly supports tax policy that promotes the growth of renewable and biobased industries
6531287 extension of the biodiesel tax incentive is essential in order to increase home grown diesel fuel supplies and refining capacity
6531288 this is asas top legislative priority during the remainder of the 110th congress
6531289 we do believe that with the current strain on current production areas to meet food feed and fuel needs it is appropriate for those acres in the conservation reserve program crp that are not environmentally sensitive to be returned to production as their contracts expire
6531290 we very much hope that agriculture and other issues of importance to rural americans plays a prominent role in the forthcoming national policy debate
6531291 asa looks forward to participating in this process and we offer our services as a resource during the presidential campaign over the coming months

6531306 the situation is not widely known among politicians in brussels
6531307 in some schools in the rural areas children dont want to go to the toilets because they are too dirty
6531308 this leads to diseases like hepatitis a and blue baby disease which is due to a high level of nitrates in drinking water
6531309 its taboo they are ashamed to talk about toilets and they dont really know how bad the situation is in their poorest areas

6531353 we had dreams that computers would improve education and improve communication and help us achieve a lot of tasks a lot of us in our group understood it
6531354 what we were doing was not figuring out how build a computer it was how you get a computer that fits into the home price looks a lot of that stuff it gave us more passion we used the word revolution all over the place
6531355 i was doing really advanced computer designs when i was 10
6531356 i just loved computers and what they were and ones and zeros and the logic and how they added
6531357 sometimes when youre short of resources it forces you to do better work
6531358 i couldnt afford an online timeshare computer system i had to write down ones and zeros and simulate the computers operations it was all done by hand never once on a computer
6531359 some of the tricks were so weird i knew youd never find them in a book
6531360 i got a job a hewlett packard designing handheld calculators i was very lucky because i could design they interviewed and hired me but i didnt have a degree

6531384 we feel it is now time to invest in indian realty projects as the quality has moved up and we see emergence of some high end developers with a product level that will support our brand

6531386 well start it off relatively small and grow it as we get more familiar with the indian market our entry has to be in mumbai and thats where everything is going on right now in terms of the high end real estate thats the place where one is going to achieve the highest prices per square foot it sets the tone for all of the other future developments
6531387 certainly the city im standing on mumbai delhi hyderabad and bangalore where the it sector has witnessed a boom

6531389 india led the world in high net wealth individuals population growth at 22 7 percent driven by market capitalization growth of 118 percent and real gross domestic product growth of 7 9 percent although indias real gdp growth decelerated from 9 4 percent in 2006 current levels are considered more stable and sustainable indias two largest exchanges the bombay stock exchange and the national stock exchange ranked among the worlds top 12 exchanges by end of 2007 boosted by initial public offering markets and heightened international interest
6531390 we expect headline inflation to possibly cross 13 percent levels with inflation likely to remain in the double digit range for the next few months and supply side measures not really being effective in bringing inflation down we expect the reserve bank of india to continue to raise rates to temper demand side pressure

6531406 sustainable development stands for meeting the needs of present generations without jeopardizing the ability of futures generations to meet their own needs in other words a better quality of life for everyone now and for generations to come it offers a vision of progress that integrates immediate and longer term objectives local and global action and regards social economic and environmental issues as inseparable and interdependent components of human progress sustainable development will not be brought about by policies only it must be taken up by society at large as a principle guiding the many choices each citizen makes every day as well as the big political and economic decisions that have this requires profound changes in thinking in economic and social structures and in consumption and production patterns

6531485 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
6531486 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

6531492 i can see 21 t 72 tanks moving towards the roki tunnel in the direction of russia
6531493 i can also see four grad artillery launchers several armoured personnel carriers and heavy trucks ready to move into the tunnel
6531494 they dont show any sign that they want to give up control
6531495 it looks like the word withdrawal is understood in different ways by different people
6531496 le olimpiadi di pechino ma anche quelle precedenti lo confesso mi danno la nausea le abolirei
6531497 pi di ogni altra cosa per il nazionalismo che mi manda in bestia il nazionalismo dello sportivo che piange allalzabandiera con la mano sul cuore lo sguardo perso verso lalto il nazionalismo dei media che danno spazio sempre agli atleti nazionali anche di discipline improbabili
6531498 i am looking for any courts that have a american judicature society elects officers and directors for 2008 2009 term
6531499 the poor economic conditions have created a very different and difficult dynamic for us this year and we werent confident that we could present a show experience that was consistent with the successes of prior years
6531500 hopefully a bigger and stronger digitallife will return in 2009 we will make additional announcements about the future of the show when details are available
6531501 all encompassing home services care program that is designed to take customer service and the companys own support capabilities to the next level
6531502 additional charges may be incurred for multiple trips extended distance beyond standard metropolitan areas as determined by at amp t including rural or limited access areas or extended time
6531503 kids do great always better than we think they will
6531504 pork and chive dumplings the texture of the wrap is chewy yet comforting perfection
6531505 the food is great portion size is extremely generous and the price is amazing
6531506 we have not been served with any lawsuit or other action by hillcrest and therefore have no comment
6531507 being sued over intellectual property is not uncommon at all
6531508 it happens on a fairly regular basis sometimes its a genuine issue over patent disputes other times the plaintiff may want to force a company to come to some kind of licensing agreement sometimes they just want to get money from a large company
6531509 its not uncommon to see lawsuits filed against companies with a large amount of equity
6531510 it allowed you to move your arm in a three dimensional space with a controller in your hand so you could control an interface on the television this was before the nintendo ever launched the wii so its possible the lawsuit has merit
6531511 ninety nine times out of 100 theres a settlement of some kind with no admission of guilt and then it goes away i dont think therell be any lasting damage to nintendo
6531512 sony had technological and production delays the ps3 was very expensive relative to the other consoles in the market and they didnt have a game franchise unique to them that was a real home run
6531513 the overhaul of the edgar system is something edgar online has advocated for years through its involvement in the development of xbrl as an interactive data solution
6531514 idea is built upon xbrl the same platform underlying i metrix and our other core products and services as a result we are uniquely positioned to offer additional tools and services as other asset classes are moved into idea using xbrl
6531515 were at the tip of the iceberg on financial information yet to be tagged in xbrl and edgar online is positioned to play a key role in providing tagging services infrastructure and analytic tools to regulators corporations and investors looking to take advantage of this rapidly expanding format
6531516 if the secs xbrl proposal is mandated we expect approximately 2 3 of the worlds market capitalization of public companies to be under a timetable for migrating to xbrl by year end
6531517 a custodian was outside near a dumpster and saw a garbage bag on the outside of the bin that looked like it was carefully placed to stand up a certain way
6531518 there were no threats or letters but they decided to call us anyway and we called the bomb squad since you cant afford to be wrong in something like this
6531519 with some of the electronic circuitry it was hard for the technicians to tell that it wasnt a bomb
6531520 we think it was basically a dumping incident that had gone awry
6531521 teachers ensured the gates were locked and everyone was in the square getting ready for assembly a group of pupils were loitering around near the staircase in this group was the dead boy jacques pretorius
6531522 i believe they were in the wrong place at the wrong time
6531523 reports that jacques died in the arms of his friend are completely untrue
6531524 mr redelinghuys is a wonderful person who always puts his pupils and teachers first he is always available to listen and would give his own life for the school
6531525 to help them come to grips with what had happened and what they saw
6531526 i came forward because i believe the school is being unfairly blamed for this incident
6531527 he tried to have a tough exterior like a shield to fit in
6531528 he was a good kid who was dealt some bad cards in life
6531529 it was an individual directing his aggression toward another individual not the school or the students inside the school
6531530 he got shot and started walking and he was holding his chest there was blood everywhere and then he fell and his arm hit me
6531531 i took off running and ran outside and called my mom
6531532 everybody started running out real fast saying he got shot
6531533 experienced a loss of power to the main rotor during takeoff initial climb
6531534 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6531535 o que deixa voc ainda mais linda e com um visual super na moda
6531536 the masterpiece no one should miss the cast no one can believe the event everyone is talking about
6531537 we talked to a lot of people and gathered a lot of input including doug williams we really believe kentucky is a place where morgan can succeed individually and compete for championships

6531541 i think the team is definitely talking to fernando but thats the question mark
6531542 i have never been so enthusiastic about my whole situation with the team i left ferrari because i didnt have the freedom to do what i wanted to do i have that at honda but i still have not had the car to perform and i am waiting for that chance
6531543 what can i say but honestly the day that i feel that i am slower than my first race is the day i will call it off and stop the conversations are there and i am talking to the team i am talking to all the teams i want to be racing
6531544 i think in terms of pure developments aerodynamic and mechanical thats it but we have to optimise everything that we brought to hungary and before we have new little things in place
6531545 this includes current and future versions of live search and spans all search verticals including local search and image search as well as consumer and enterprise customer segments

6531549 en santiago del estero hay un reclutamiento no tico se aprovechan de madres pobres a quienes no les dicen que sus hijos van a ser sometidos a un protocolo las hacen firmar sin leer e incluso las amenazan si quieren abandonar el estudio
6531550 ni siquiera los padres saben si sus chicos reciben la vacuna no estamos contra la investigaci n pero hay un mal manejo tico
6531551 detectamos firmas de analfabetos testigos que eran integrantes del experimento y el investigador principal formaba parte del comit evaluador

6531554 george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself he will leave office with the country 10 trillion in debt fighting two wars our international reputation in shambles our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises our citizens faith in our own country ripped to shreds yet bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been i fear to the depth of my being that john mccain is just like him
6531555 no club has been in touch with us at all
6531556 the best thing that could happen is that no player leaves right now espanyol have a fantastic team
6531557 the club has fixed a price on the player and we are not going to accept less
6531558 i believe once somebody cannot play for you in europe it devalues the player for the season but it is not necessarily stopping you from buying a player
6531559 i can surprise you sometimes as i got one in whom you did not expect and there still might be one more player coming in
6531560 there is interest always but i do not want to give you any names
6531561 he can play centre back he can play left back and that is an area where we were a bit inexperienced
6531562 the practice of using a single isbn for all digital manifestations of the same work is strongly discouraged
6531563 helping academic publishers introduce epub into their workflow is definitely something im interested in especially since epub is synonymous with getting content into xhtml which opens up the whole web as a distribution channel
6531564 i dont know much about the business side of isbns but from the epub perspective each epub book is required by the spec to have a unique identifier
6531565 specific uses of urls or isbns are not yet addressed
6531566 its an open question what should go into this unique identifier field some publishers are using
6531567 but the format at any rate does not require an isbn at all publishers can and certainly will generate their own ids when isbn doesnt apply or isnt economically feasible e g for content designed to be freely distributed
6531568 the iphone is an ideal platform to help introduce the entirely new audi a4 to the public
6531569 audi customers are smart sophisticated and technologically savvy as a brand we are committed to progress and innovation at every turn were very excited to be the first automotive manufacturer to connect with our audience through the iphone
6531570 this is the first application by an automotive oem but its also reinventing the shopping experience in combination with the a4 iphone web site this is the first viable mobile marketing solution in the automotive space importantly it is also a unique way to engage the consumer with the dna of the audi brand
6531571 in the spring of 2006 robert bigelow needed to take a stand on a trip to russia to keep a satellite off the floor
6531572 a range of 10 to 20 minutes seems likely for the tiny fraction of the most disproportionate bandwidth users
6531573 if they continue to a disproportionate user after they get de prioritized the technique will come back on again but if they change their consumption behavior there wont be any impact
6531574 as a result of those collaborations we became aware of the fact that some of these new technologies would enable us
6531575 our goal is to get to this technique before the end of the year and im sure well have more to say about it soon
6531576 to critique and oppose the misogyny discrimination and disinformation in the mainstream media including mainstream blogs and other outlets of new media
6531577 you know her shes got wild eyes and rumpled hair at some point she stopped caring about the stains on her blouse shes hurt angry rejected and shes willing to take the whole damn place down with her she is lady macbeth
6531578 she is the oldest literary type around the bitter madwoman hellbent on revenge and willing to act against her own interest to win some respect
6531579 these disgruntled women whether they plan to vote for john mccain sit out the election or simply gobble up airtime are tacitly working toward electing mccain a candidate who claimed last week at a presidential forum at saddleback church that life begins at the moment of conception and who voted against legislation ensuring equal pay for women
6531580 its been wild my phone is just attached to me im up always its been the most invigorating time of my life
6531581 for all practical purposes military to military cooperation had really already been suspended with the russians
6531582 nato canceled some exercises and i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6531583 they made a commitment to withdraw we expect them to withdraw

6531586 so great was his prudence that from his mind a bourn of prudence seemed to flow for he beheld together the past the present and the future and was able to tell by the counsel of god what in each case was to be done
6531587 prudence or euboulia deliberating well whether acquired or infused directs man in the research of counsel according to principles that the reason can grasp hence prudence or euboulia deliberating well makes man take good counsel either for himself or for another
6531588 the thoughts of mortal men are fearful and our counsels uncertain

6531602 the new administration did make a lot of changes in its first 100 days the sheer number and the sheer pace fooled everyone into thinking that change had indeed come to washington i thought that the countrys trajectory had actually been altered that a new direction had been set in u s policy
6531603 it turns out though that apocalypse comes in many different forms there are the dramatic effects of sword and fire and famine and then theres the apocalypse of muddling through thats what happens when you just carry on with the same old same old and before you know it poof end of the world its an apocalypse thats neither too cold nor too hot neither too hard nor too soft its the apocalypse of the middle the goldilocks apocalypse

6531688 the problem our campaign had in 2000 is we made emotional decisions got wrapped up in the bubble thats a reflection of john he at times makes emotional decisions and when he does they are almost always a mistake thats what you see right now youve got to resist this decision making in a bubble being angry at obama or personalizing it thats a danger

6531705 cred ca este o suferinta a romaniei faptul ca nu exista o lege concreta a voluntariatului niste drepturi ale voluntarului sau un ajutor pentru voluntar
6531706 voluntarul ar insemana o oferire a propriului eu catre folosinta sociala

6531710 we are examining the order and are evaluating our options
6531711 if congress had wanted us to regulate internet network management it would have said so explicitly in the statue
6531712 in other words if the fcc already possessed the authority to do this why have bills been introduced giving us the authority we ostensibly already had
6531713 we can nationally increase our awareness some states dont have places like jva

6531720 i am not going to a chinese hospital not even an herbal one
6531721 i could go to school and walk across the street and go to work
6531722 it would take this department to a completely new level
6531723 it would make us one of the top ten hotel management programs in the country
6531724 i think weve realized over time that tourism is the number one industry in the state and that we can bring in even more money in the future
6531725 we are excited to acquire this cutting edge technology and feel that it will be a very useful patient care plan decision tool for our regional medical colleagues with nearly 95 000 u s deaths estimated for 2008 combined statistics for breast colorectal and prostate cancers we need every tool we can get to make good treatment decisions
6531726 muchos mexicanos extraordinarios son producto de la educaci n p blica y de la formaci n en las escuelas normales
6531727 encontrar mejores salidas en todo terreno en una mejor preparaci n para los alumnos

6531735 a player can function or cant function with the injury and right now kevin cant function
6531736 we know kevins a very tough guy and he was trying but he was just not able to get open out there
6531737 shawns going to give it a go and well just see how he does
6531738 were going to try to keep good communication with him during the game and give him an opportunity to play
6531739 we can nationally increase our awareness some states dont have places like jva
6531740 criminal background checks in order to ensure the safety of our fans and employees

6531742 i dont know if its our immediate future its something we talk about every few months
6531743 its something we would never take lightly and just say that would be fun its a lot of work and we recognize that
6531744 in a way we want to be selfish because we love our life but we know how much that adds to it
6531745 if they would be as pretty as brad and angelinas kids we might
6531746 that damn yankee rifle can be loaded on sunday and fired all week
6531747 we can nationally increase our awareness some states dont have places like jva
6531748 i have great respect for genes unprecedented hall of fame career i also admired gene upshaw the union leader for his leadership intelligence and partnership during his 25 year career with the nfl players association most importantly i admired gene upshaw the person he was a true gentleman and his contributions to our great game first as a high character highly skilled player and later as the head of the players union will never be forgotten
6531749 its a terrible day a sad day it really got me by surprise i know hes had a tremendous influence not only on me but a lot of our players and people in this league were going to miss gene upshaw a quality guy
6531750 i am stunned and saddened by the news of gene upshaws death i enjoyed working with gene over the years and found him to be a complete professional a great credit to the game and a man of outstanding character he will be missed my deepest sympathy goes out to his family
6531751 its a huge benefit having that many kids back who know the system things go a little quicker

6531753 we were so close last year to finally reaching our goal of making the playoffs
6531754 weve got to stay healthy weve got to play 48 minutes of football the last four years we can count two or three players that are the difference in being 6 3 or 5 4 being a playoff team or not weve got to play 48 solid minutes
6531755 just the fact we were so close has given us the thought that we can do it
6531756 being that close we know we need to focus a little bit more
6531757 those couple of plays in a game are the difference between making it and not making it
6531758 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6531759 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
6531760 its one big step forward in improving the safety of fresh produce
6531761 its expensive and it doesnt really address the problem at the source
6531762 since the minute we opened the door june 20 weve been busy
6531763 since we moved into the bigger building weve used every single drop here
6531764 we recently bought a new barrel system that will allow us to keep up with demand

6531766 saugatuck is a very diverse community and we have clientele ranging from 20 somethings to 80 year olds who come in during lunch
6531767 its a multi functional hall its really for whatever the imagination can dream up for the space
6531768 nothing like this really exists in the saugatuck douglas area

6531770 i havent been a real distance running aficionado ive always been with sprinters and jumpers so ive learned a whole lot this whole year

6531783 a partner with me in strengthening this economy for the middle class and working families
6531784 i want somebody whos independent somebody who can push against my preconceived notions and challenge me so we have got a robust debate in the white house
6531785 apples core business and legacy businesses are vertical solutions where theyve been able to control the entire stack for the end user experience and that has boded well for them because in that closed environment they can guarantee certain levels of quality of service and satisfaction what they are finding out now is that when you start to work with a wireless carrier there are a lot of balls in play there
6531786 what weve found here at yankee group is that theyve also run into technology issues in passing off calls from umts to edge
6531787 that is another indication of how a traditional mobile phone manufacturer understands these issues and how important they are the transfers from network to network to maintain the level of consistency and quality of service i think apple is finding out the hard way that that needs to be perfected before going to market
6531788 prospects for the long heralded third pipe appear dim and dimming
6531789 in terms of wireless and broadband buildouts theres unlikely to be another new national buildout other than clearwire in the foreseeable future
6531790 the market is as competitive as it is ever going to be as far as we can see and it could become less competitive
6531791 he tried to have a tough exterior like a shield to fit in
6531792 he was a good kid who was dealt some bad cards in life
6531793 it was an individual directing his aggression toward another individual not the school or the students inside the school
6531794 he got shot and started walking and he was holding his chest there was blood everywhere and then he fell and his arm hit me
6531795 i took off running and ran outside and called my mom
6531796 everybody started running out real fast saying he got shot
6531797 because the animals would still need the care of humans

6531802 we made sure customers did not park where the wall looked most dangerous by parking our cars there
6531803 the road drains have been blocked for some time i have made about 15 requests to the council for action to be taken
6531804 i heard a loud bang looked out the window and saw what had happened it was a little scary but we were soon reassured everything would be all right
6531805 our initial response was to fence off the affected area so that public safety was maintained
6531806 the pullback of russian forces is taking place at such a tempo that by the end of aug 22 they will be in the zones of responsibility of russian peacekeepers
6531807 we are waiting for the russians to respect their word
6531808 we waited twice with dashed hopes this time it appears that there is at least the beginning of a fulfilment
6531809 there has not been much evidence of any significant russian withdrawals there have been what i would call some minimal movements to date
6531810 its not they its we who will erase them from the face of earth
6531811 say what you will about boses price to performance ratio

6531815 que aquele que n o levantou a m o para nada tem um maniconio ao lado
6531816 no one on the team wanted to talk about it and i was getting frustrated
6531817 i wanted to talk about it i wanted to do something with the other teams to make a statement
6531818 i walked up to stacey porter their main hitter and said can i talk to you a second
6531819 i told her i know you guys had a tough loss and i dont know whats going to happen in our game tonight but we need to unite and create a message
6531820 it was that moment i realized no matter what happened i wanted to do this after the game
6531821 every time i needed to get through a workout or a run i closed my eyes and imagined a gold medal and that has driven me for the last four years
6531822 to have that not happen i am heartbroken i feel exhausted its been a rough day
6531823 it was hard to go up to australia and japan after the game and say hey can we do something together united sure we were just feeling this negativity toward each other but lets do something positive
6531824 but this is not about america its not about the eight teams that are here this game is so much bigger than us and it was so much more important for us to do this with a loss than after a win
6531825 that was the question of the week do you think dominating this game hurts the sport i kept saying over and over we dont dominate
6531826 at first they thought we wanted to play catch with them
6531827 then they thought we wanted to take pictures with their team i didnt know if they ever truly understood so i said just come with me and i took them by the hands
6531828 we split the three buckets between us and started placing balls on the field
6531829 i walked over to yukiko ueno and handed her a ball
6531830 i was holding hands with stacey porter and ueno the pitcher who just defeated us and we were chanting back softball
6531831 it was beautiful i felt more emotional than i did all day
6531832 it shows that this sport is a lot more equal than people say
6531833 that was the question of the week do you think dominating this game hurts the sport i kept saying over and over we dont dominate
6531834 there is disparity and so much talent in this sport those questions bothered me because the olympics should be about doing your best i know there are people who are happy we lost because they think its better for the sport and that frustrates me that is not what sport is about
6531835 since when has someone told michael were going to eliminate swimming because you are doing way too well
6531836 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have august 19 2008
6531837 poor judgment was used by bringing an airsoft gun one that can be purchased at wal mart on campus that can shoot plastic bbs

6531871 in definitiva il cvm presenta una pluripotenzialit tossica e la malattia si pu manifestare in maniera pi o meno completa in rapporto a livelli e durata dellesposizione ma sicuramente la scoperta della capacit oncogena del cloruro di vinile che ha polarizzato lattenzione su questo monomero
6531872 il cloruro di vinile stato associato con tumori al fegato cervello polmone e sistema emopoietico un largo numero di studi epidemiologici e di case reports ha confermato lassociazione causale tra cvm e angiosarcoma del fegato numerosi studi confermano anche che lesposizione al cvm causa altre forme di cancro come ad esempio carcinoma epatocellulare tumori al cervello tumori polmonari e tumori maligni del sistema linfatico ed emopoietico
6531873 il pvc non si comporta come un materiale inerte bens come una sostanza biologicamente attiva che esplica unazione nociva sui tessuti
6531874 in tempi lunghi allinsorgenza di neoplasie mesenchimali maligne nelle sedi di impianto addirittura di tumori maligni diversi in vari distretti organici

6531876 la mortalit per tutti i tumori inferiore alle attese si osservano due casi di tumore epatico rispetto ad un valore atteso nazionale di 1 1 e regionale di 1 3
6531877 e possibile una epidemia occulta di tumori nellarea di marghera
6531878 le questioni relative alla protezione della salute allinterno del petrolchimico sono da anni gestite in modo contraddittorio e spesso confuso perch con troppa disinvoltura ed in troppe occasioni le parti sociali e gli stessi enti pubblici hanno accettato che la salute dei lavoratori potesse essere oggetto di trattativa politica e sindacale
6531879 di forme tumorali a carico di lavoratori per i quali risulta positivo il rapporto tra esposizione pregressa e rischio ambientale di oncogenesi e manifestazione della malattia
6531880 che il rischio di oncogenesi nellarea di marghera sicuramente rilevante infatti nei diversi cicli produttivi sono presenti anche in grandi quantit almeno 8 tra le 18 sostanze chimiche riconosciute cancerogene dallo iarc della organizzazione mondiale della sanit e almeno 6 tra quelle riconosciute sospette
6531881 costituisce la massima concentrazione di rischio nellarea industriale di porto marghera con caratteristiche produttive che in particolare enfatizzano il rischio di oncogenesi per la quantit e la qualit delle sostanze chimiche impiegate
6531882 alterazione della funzionalit epatica nella cui genesi ha giocato un ruolo importante la esposizione a cloruro di vinile opportuno evitare la esposizione a cloruro di vinile
6531883 el ambiente antiinmigrante de los ltimos a os ha sido muy fuerte a estos j venes las leyes migratorias no les afectan porque ya son estadounidenses pero les preocupa el ambiente hostil hacia su gente la discriminaci n

6531885 para eso vamos a las escuelas para hacerles ver que si est n preocupados por la guerra o por no poder llenar el dep sito con su voto pueden cambiar las cosas

6531906 as usual news organizations are deeply afraid to say that one side is more negative than the other doing so sounds unfair its much easier and less controversial to say that both candidates are being negative that would be balanced but also untrue

6531943 i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion
6531944 that was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe vs wade
6531945 and that essentially adding an additional doctor who then has to be called in an emergency situation to come in and make these assessments is really designed simply to burden the original decision
6531946 music in tenor and whiskey on counters smokes in gold wrappers and advil for migraines pretty green placards to keep staffers at bay coffee and reeces in bright red and gray

6531960 much of the coverage regarding kexins age has only mentioned allegation of fraud and the ioc has ignored the matter completely
6531961 how official are these documents pretty dang official they were issued by the general administration of sport of china

6531967 a dividing line shows up in this ny times cbs poll according to the analysis by mr cooper and ms sussman mr obama the presumptive democratic nominee was trusted more by voters to handle their top concern the economy sixty five percent of those surveyed said they were confident that mr obama would make the right decisions on the economy compared with 54 percent who expressed confidence that mr mccain would when it came to foreign policy the image was inverted 66 percent expressed confidence in mr mccain to make the right decisions and 55 percent in mr obama the economy ranks far higher than national security or the iraq war as a top concern among voters in the new survey which indicated that respondents were more negative about the economy than at any time since 1992 when as the article notes bill clinton won the presidency with the admonishment that its the economy stupid

6531975 are you sure i dont want to swim to nong khai
6531976 i cant believe eating good croissants is more important to you than going to a flooded disaster zone
6531977 in all topics mr obama displays a similar worried serious looking facial pattern even when talking about more positive subjects his facial expressions do not signal positive affective states
6531978 there is an element of the fact that he is on the edges of his comfort zone here
6531979 going into a presidential campaign is not something he has done before and you could say it is written all over his face
6531980 the dominating attitude as transmitted by his vocal style is that of concern and sincere involvement
6531981 his smile is often not fully developed ie his cheek raising muscles do not participate enough in the expression of positive affect to be perceived as genuine
6531982 it hard to justify five stars for any cd but i feel so much is new and unique while being delivered so professionally it deserves this rating to get people to listen

6531986 your arms are fine you must have just slept on them wrong but you have a mass in your chest that is 6 cm about 2 inches long wen you get home you need to get to a doctor and schedule a biopsie to find out if it is cancerous or not
6531987 i am sorry to tell you but it is hodgkins lymphoma cancer
6531988 i think everybody realises it means the world to me to retain the armband
6531989 to get the armband back is a huge achievement for me
6531990 i heard about an hour before the news conference just after training the manager called the whole squad together and told us as a whole
6531991 for me to get it above the likes of rio ferdinand and the other players in the squad is a great honour
6531992 id never given up on the armband and never will do
6531993 id heard the whispers that rio had got the armband so i was a little bit shocked but ive got to make the most of it
6531994 my target now is to qualify for the world cup and thats the aim going forward
6531995 rio when he was captain played very well the same level as john
6531996 it was not easy for me to choose because they are very good players
6531997 the big personality of john was the reason i chose john but rio is very important to the team

6532009 it looks pretty nice its very wide and the surface looks very smooth it looks pretty fun so we will see tomorrow it looks nice when you walk it but it is a different story when you go 300km h around it but i expect to have good fun when we drive around
6532010 it takes a few laps when you know where to go but you learn and learn all the time small things and small lines but i would not say it is too hard
6532011 there are a few bumps because i guess they need to turn the bridge sometimes that is the only place where i found any bumps on the circuit and one of them is in the middle of the corner so that might affect things a bit but apart from that the circuit looks very smooth and very well done we will see tomorrow how good it is in the end but i expect to have quite good fun
6532012 definitely we would rather have won more races we had some chances but in the end we couldnt win them but we are still in a good position for the championship although the season could have been much better it could also have been much worse
6532013 overall i am happy where we are right now lately the races have not been exactly what i was expecting so hopefully we will get some good races now and get back where we should be the biggest issue is getting stuck behind people after having a bad qualifying so if we can sort out that then we should be fine we just need to work on some things and hopefully we will get back to winning some races
6532014 i dont really worry about anything there are many races to go it is easy to lose points but also easy to win we will try to do the best every weekend and hopefully after a few races we are still in a good position and then we can try and win the championship
6532015 more or less there is pressure every race so it doesnt really change anything when it gets later in the season when you have the chance to win the championship it is more crucial not to make any mistakes but that is normal all the time like i said we will do the best we can every race and then see where we end up
6532016 we will try at least at the last race i ran off the circuit as the handling was not what we expected i just ran wide it is always easy to say that i have fixed this or that but we should be fine
6532017 we know when we get everything as we want that we have the speed but it hasnt been easy it is a similar situation to last year so its not the first time to be in this position hopefully we can fix it now and have better qualifying and better races after that
6532018 every race is crucial its not just monaco the last race if you look you could not get past anybody if they did not make a mistake so it is the same here the circuit is very wide and there are some long straights so here there are some better overtaking chances than in hungary
6532019 but still if you are not in front then you are going to lose many seconds stuck behind people even if you get past them in the end it is always crucial to be at the front
6532020 there is no one issue sometimes it goes right sometimes not at the last race i ran off the circuit which doesnt help but like i said we havent been exactly happy with the handling and it easily makes it look worse than it is
6532021 the problem is that it is very close between everybody now and if you are one tenth slower you lose three places we would have fixed it if we knew what to do but i think we will find a solution we just need to put more effort in and try to get it right
6532022 q do you think the summer break was a help for you allowing you to recharge a bit
6532023 i really dont know we will see tomorrow and over the weekend but i enjoyed it i had a good time we havent had good races lately for many different reasons but we know we have the speed if we get things right so im not too worried about it the main thing like i said before is the qualifying after that we have good speed when we get it right
6532024 i was mainly home just doing different stuff seeing my friends and family and just enjoying it ive been watching a lot of the olympics enjoying whatever sport was on and for me the highlights have been the sprint races the one hundred and two hundred metres especially
6532025 well what can i say i havent been fast enough that is the first point without going off in the last qualifying we could easily have been in third place so it is the small things that when it goes wrong you lose a lot of time and it looks much worse than it is
6532026 it can be just a small issue and it makes you go off the circuit and run wide and you lose a lot of time since we changed to these tyres even last year i wasnt exactly happy in qualifying even though in race conditions we are much happier with the car
6532027 it is not a new issue sometimes we get it right and sometimes we dont
6532028 but we are still looking for it and it depends a lot on the circuits at some circuits it is easier to get it right at some its very difficult hopefully we have found some halfway solution where we are fast but can still be happy with
6532029 i dont see any point to do anything silly we are as hard as we can be we try to overtake when we have a chance but it is not so easy to get in the position always i dont see any point to be harder to any one of them we are hard to anybody and we try to win
6532030 the difference is only five points but every time we are behind him we are going to lose more points so definitely we will try to be in front of the people who are ahead of us i dont think i am driving better than before i dont think i drove badly before we just could not get it right so well see what we can do this weekend and go from there
6532031 the right to vote is the primary right by which other rights are protected

6532039 its pretty humbling isnt it for an old fisherman and surfer in queensland who now and then plays a bit of cricket
6532040 were constantly evolving and refreshing the team people come and go all the time to provide a balance of voices
6532041 once upon a time test match special was part of a great tradition of bbc radio
6532042 but they are bringing in commentators with little knowledge of the game especially of the cadences of test match cricket
6532043 they must sit there with reference books on their laps they just dont know enough about the game
6532044 some of the one day internationals have been perfectly dreadful very much b team
6532045 they are coming from the shop floor of the sports room we need two or three really top flight commentators that is all that test match special needs to get by they have got to be the best
6532046 the us sanctions initially had a negative impact on the banks reputation and created troubles but in practice there was no halt in our operations
6532047 we are now working with important international commercial and correspondent banks on a daily basis including european asian and african ones
6532048 this economy has its own attractions even under the worst conditions
6532049 it will be troublesome if europe imposes unilateral sanctions on irans banks but we will be able to again replace the outgoing banks
6532050 domestic investment on its own cannot meet the countrys needs which makes iran an opportunity for foreign banks particularly as investment banks not retail banks to function as gates in attracting foreign investment

6532053 the only issue thats more severe than this would be the idea that an islamic fundamentalist would get his hands on a nuclear weapon and use it against us
6532054 beyond that theres nothing thats more severe this issue represents the potential fiscal meltdown of this nation

6532066 while my past actions were unfortunate and for which i have expressed to my family my sincere apology one blogger has alleged that official rules or laws were broken that simply is not true
6532067 its sad that my political opponents have chosen to resort to the lowest tactics by dredging up a private matter from years ago just 21 days before an election
6532068 were very supportive of paying royalties but this structure is wrong unfair and unaffordable
6532069 it doesnt look to us like the industry that dying

6532071 any agency that has to deal with this many deaths its difficult
6532072 until we have something back from forensics we are not going to talk about the cause or manner of death
6532073 normally its pretty quiet but when this happened people started telling about arrests all over here
6532074 any agency that has to deal with this many deaths its difficult

6532079 hopefully this thorough report puts to rest the various 9 11 conspiracy theories which dishonor the men and women who lost their lives on that terrible day
6532080 the public should really recognize the science is really behind what we have said
6532081 the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery
6532082 when this critical column buckled due to lack of floor supports it was the first domino in the chain

6532090 the biggest problem we have had is to retrofit the building for modern elevators to move people fast enough for what our biggest needs are
6532091 the old elevators are small and slow and we dont want to build another elevator shaft
6532092 last week we said were not going to do that
6532093 het spijt me ik hoop dat je het me kan vergeven george clooney
6532094 there might be a minor blip but long term theyll be able to regain that trust and reputation that they may have lost
6532095 theyve been very communicative theyve been really open and honest theyre working really well with the public health authorities theyve taken precedent setting action in terms of shutting down that whole plant to assure the public that they have this bacterium under control
6532096 while the 2007 recall is now largely behind us its impact on our profitability and on our leverage ratios will be felt for some time to come
6532097 theyre acting pretty quickly so the view is theyre trying to be a good corporate citizen
6532098 i think theyve done a lot and now what they should do is say okay now were going to check everything and go through all the steps to make sure this never happens again
6532099 time now is of the essence to make sure they dont lose more than they need to in terms of their reputational capital
6532100 so theyre going to have to get into that plant get it done quickly and reassure the public that its been done in a way that is thorough and effective they know the risks of reputational damage and they cant afford to have this happen again

6532103 the feeling is hard to describe after all these years i never thought it would come down to this you give up hope
6532104 would say hi like nothing happened i wish i knew back then what i know today
6532105 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6532106 we have to let go and were not reluctant to do that and the iraqis are not reluctant to take control

6532109 reports that actor jean reno is in the hospital due to a heart attack are false he is vacationing in the caribbean and went to a local hospital as a precaution for some discomfort he was feeling due to heartburn and gastroenteritis it was definitely not a heart attack he is fine and healthy and enjoying the rest of his vacation traveling in the caribbean
6532110 graduation from college is a wonderful achievement for students and parents but these days its often a stressful experience as well todays students come face to face with the prospect of repaying their student loan debt at a time when theyre just discovering the realities of independent living on an entry level salary
6532111 when a student complicates matters by taking on more credit card debt than they can properly manage theyre also pushing back the clock on buying a home and starting a family the traditional benchmarks of the american dream

6532119 todays decision indicates the fec has finally recognized that at least in some cases members of congress should not be allowed to use campaign funds to bail them out of legal problems of their own making this breaks with the fecs pattern of granting members permission to pay lawyers with campaign funds nearly every time the issue has been raised it remains to be seen whether this is a one time decision or whether the fec really is breaking with its past precedents
6532120 i think it was valid i think we have one of the finest town counsels in the state and we go on his recommendation and he said it was ok and we did it
6532121 to consider the purchase exchange lease or value of real property if an open discussion may have a detrimental effect on the negotiating position of the governmental body with a person firm or corporation
6532122 our newspapers believe the public has a strong and compelling interest in the details of a proposed resort casino and its possible impact on the economy and overall quality of life in the region
6532123 in addition if town owned land is or might be involved the public has a right to know the details and to have firsthand access to the discussions about the sale or transfer of that land except when exemption 6 is properly cited
6532124 to discuss real estate negotiations and to meet with counsel on verizon negotiations
6532125 we dont fool around with that we do go by the letter of the law and many times theres a little bit of gray area
6532126 beyond that i will speak to the district attorneys office when and if they call me thats about it
6532127 we dont know how to explain this so when we dont know how to explain things in the medical world we call it a miracle and this is probably what happened
6532128 there have been a number of well documented case histories of adults and children who drowned in very cold water even trapped under ice for hours and were successfully revived many hours later
6532129 of course this is used routinely in modern cardiac bypass
6532130 there is some historical precedent for how this might work
6532131 many years ago some babies were put into ice water at birth to try to revive them there were reports that this actually could be effective and that some children survived
6532132 i am convinced that cold therapy helped this young man
6532133 although i read the report i still find it hard to believe
6532134 usually cool temperatures increase the likelihood of death in extremely preterm infants
6532135 probably the doctors could not feel a pulse heard few or no heartbeats and saw that the baby was not moving now it can be very difficult to be sure about death in such immature babies right after birth i have seen cases in my own institution of mistaken diagnosis
6532136 man this is annoying having to walk straight into the sun like this

6532179 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6532180 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6532181 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama

6532212 no significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rbst supplemented and non rbst supplemented cows

6532277 when terrorism becomes really extensive in an area we generally no longer call it terrorism but rather war or insurgency
6532278 largely the product of sectarian violence rampant criminal activity and home grown insurgency and therefore grossly distort the global terrorism picture
6532279 it makes no sense to count civilian casualties in a war zone as deaths caused by terrorism mr zakaria wrote since the mid 1990s thousands of civilians have been killed in war zones in other countries around the world and those victims werent counted as casualties related to terrorism
6532280 obviously the war didnt fuel extremist views in muslim countries

6532288 at the highest level you can say that ebs has done for the disk drive what ec2 has done for the computer
6532289 this greatly increases the flexibility enterprises have to use their block storage you can put applications file systems databases everything up on it
6532290 with ebs independent of all your ec2 instance you can provision storage volumes from 1gb to 1tb and attach one or more storage volumes to a single instance
6532291 for example if you need 4tb of local storage which is a small instance you can provision that as four 1tb volumes and attach it to that instance

6532329 the impact of climate change on human and global security could extend far beyond the limited scope the world has seen thus far
6532330 environmental changes caused by global warming will not only affect human living conditions but may also generate larger societal effects by threatening the infrastructures of society or by inducing social responses that aggravate the problem
6532331 the associated socio economic and political stress can undermine the functioning of communities the effectiveness of institutions and the stability of societal structures these degraded conditions could contribute to civil strife and worse armed conflict
6532332 food miles created are only one part of the equation this study will look at the whole cycle of production which is the only fair way to go
6532333 our research has shown nearly three quarters of the uk public want to use their weekly shop to reduce poverty in the developing world but they dont want to spend over the odds especially with the global economic situation and theyre quite rightly concerned about climate change
6532334 this research will enable the industry here one of the biggest wine exporters in the world to understand the carbon cost they pose to the environment this is crucial to maintaining south africas competitive position in global fruit and wine export markets in order to continue to employ local people
6532335 there is international pressure from consumers worldwide who want to know what the carbon footprint of produce brought in supermarkets is this study is about satisfying requirements in a market that is becoming increasingly difficult
6532336 they forecast trends but we have to do the research for the right reasons
6532337 we have to measure where we are in terms of our environmental impact and determine a way forward we have to act from a position of knowledge
6532338 the research will benefit commercial as well as small scale farmers
6532339 the web based calculator that producers will use will enable us to determine how we measure up to international standards and benchmarks
6532340 the carbon footprint of produce is being discussed globally but we have not seen a decrease in our export volumes
6532341 solar rebate applications have grown more than 13 fold within just over 12 months and recent changes to the scheme mean that rebates are now going to families that most need financial assistance to install solar systems

6532343 over the past several years president carter has repeatedly and relentlessly undermined israels position on the world stage
6532344 he has blatantly disregarded the standard code of conduct on issues related to international affairs always to the detriment of israel and its citizens affording mr carter a prime speaking engagement on the democrats brightest stage is an affront to the state of israel and to all american zionists whether they are christians or jews

6532349 governments need to focus on reducing emissions caused by deforestation and forest degradation
6532350 we wouldnt be there if we didnt see good profits out of that kind of business
6532351 bioenergy is well integrated into the paper and pulp mills where you can combine biomass coming from forests and mass production
6532352 previously wood scraps have been unused totally so this will definitely improve the companies profitability
6532353 but it is not going to change the total picture of the forestry industry it will be a side product
6532354 i think ten years from now the biofuel industry will be equally as big as the paper industry today
6532355 it will not help norske skogs earnings in the next year or two but it could be significant in the long term

6532393 would it not be better to spend any extra money on premiership clubs
6532394 when you look at developing players they are all attached to regions and clubs in south wales
6532395 what would happen to them would the wru want to relocate them to north wales

6532434 we had dreams that computers would improve education and improve communication and help us achieve a lot of tasks a lot of us in our group understood it
6532435 what we were doing was not figuring out how build a computer it was how you get a computer that fits into the home price looks a lot of that stuff it gave us more passion we used the word revolution all over the place
6532436 i was doing really advanced computer designs when i was 10
6532437 i just loved computers and what they were and ones and zeros and the logic and how they added
6532438 sometimes when youre short of resources it forces you to do better work
6532439 i couldnt afford an online timeshare computer system i had to write down ones and zeros and simulate the computers operations it was all done by hand never once on a computer
6532440 some of the tricks were so weird i knew youd never find them in a book
6532441 i got a job a hewlett packard designing handheld calculators i was very lucky because i could design they interviewed and hired me but i didnt have a degree
6532442 i did go back to college i got my degree under a fake name rocky raccoon clark

6532450 these press guys who write stuff like that they get seated first in the prime seats
6532451 now were in the age of blogs opinions get replicated facts dont come into play much
6532452 i dont like any articles that put people down like steve jobs because it sells everybody likes to see heroes beat up

6532463 bioenergy is well integrated into the paper and pulp mills where you can combine biomass coming from forests and mass production
6532464 previously wood scraps have been unused totally so this will definitely improve the companies profitability
6532465 but it is not going to change the total picture of the forestry industry it will be a side product

6532471 e proprio vero che il tema della giustizia costituisce un nervo scoperto per una parte della sinistra daltra parte non appena aprono bocca alcuni magistrati come cascini e ingroia mettono in evidenza la loro estrema politicizzazione
6532472 berlusconi ha parlato del problema della riforma della giustizia non vi si puo rispondere come fa cascini evocando il fascismo ne dandogli lezioni di lotta alla mafia come fa in modo saccente ingroia per altro molto piu taciturno e sobrio al tempo del governo di centro sinistra malgrado che su questo terreno lattuale governo con il ministro alfano abbia gia fatto cose molto significative
6532473 ne la sinistra ne i magistrati appartenenti a md possono strumentalizzare falcone contro il quale a suo tempo condussero una lotta senza esclusione di colpi sia in occasione di nomine importanti alla procura di palermo sia per quello che riguardo la procura antimafia sia quando egli fu impegnato al ministero di grazia e giustizia comunque risulta evidente che una parte della sinistra non rinuncia alluso politico della giustizia che di pietro intende cavalcare insieme il qualunquismo e il giustizialismo e che un settore della magistratura viene preso da una crisi di nervi non appena si parla di una riforma globale della giustizia

6532483 governments need to focus on reducing emissions caused by deforestation and forest degradation
6532484 the impact of climate change on human and global security could extend far beyond the limited scope the world has seen thus far
6532485 environmental changes caused by global warming will not only affect human living conditions but may also generate larger societal effects by threatening the infrastructures of society or by inducing social responses that aggravate the problem
6532486 the associated socio economic and political stress can undermine the functioning of communities the effectiveness of institutions and the stability of societal structures these degraded conditions could contribute to civil strife and worse armed conflict

6532496 food miles created are only one part of the equation this study will look at the whole cycle of production which is the only fair way to go
6532497 our research has shown nearly three quarters of the uk public want to use their weekly shop to reduce poverty in the developing world but they dont want to spend over the odds especially with the global economic situation and theyre quite rightly concerned about climate change
6532498 this research will enable the industry here one of the biggest wine exporters in the world to understand the carbon cost they pose to the environment this is crucial to maintaining south africas competitive position in global fruit and wine export markets in order to continue to employ local people
6532499 there is international pressure from consumers worldwide who want to know what the carbon footprint of produce brought in supermarkets is this study is about satisfying requirements in a market that is becoming increasingly difficult
6532500 they forecast trends but we have to do the research for the right reasons
6532501 we have to measure where we are in terms of our environmental impact and determine a way forward we have to act from a position of knowledge
6532502 the research will benefit commercial as well as small scale farmers
6532503 the web based calculator that producers will use will enable us to determine how we measure up to international standards and benchmarks
6532504 the carbon footprint of produce is being discussed globally but we have not seen a decrease in our export volumes
6532505 this biased perception of reality can create the basis for future decisions without our awareness

6532512 two of the most critical allies that he picked in the war on terror that he identified early on in his administration putin and musharraf have disappointed him mightily
6532513 whoever walks into the oval office in january is going to have his hands full
6532514 it is a huge challenge given the current pakistani government is much less willing to challenge the taliban than musharraf was
6532515 the combination of russian anger and strength is a potent mix that the next president will have to deal with
6532516 what i feel is the greatest lesson to be learned is that everybody does deserve a second chance or a third chance if you believe that they can actually come back and do some good in my case i had a lot of people believing in me

6532518 in the last two years the horse has had all kinds of experience to be in the best position he could be

6532520 the school did not merely find the confederate flag offensive to some students but rather found that in a context of high racial tensions race related altercations and threats of violence the flag would disrupt the schools educational process
6532521 its something i wouldnt have been able to do if i didnt grow up in the valley
6532522 so i needed something else i saw the power lines and i started working with the shapes and color layering once i put watercolor and acrylic on the paper thats when the power lines started to stick
6532523 during the process of taking and editing pictures of power lines for my series
6532524 i began to pay attention to the subtle differences that are always present in day to day experiences the same power lines were transformed when a bird came and went or the sky changed color sometimes there are birds sometimes there arent so this is something you might see every day but not care much about

6532526 maybe the next time youre driving around youll slow down and notice
6532527 we were the first band to have bands open up for us
6532528 even though all that happened he asked us when our next opening was

6532545 the speaker said this will be the most open congress in history in reality its been the most closed look at the number of closed rules weve had and on the number issue energy what did we do we went on recess
6532546 eighty percent of the worlds oil is controlled by countries not companies its too dangerous for america to keep relying on foreign oil
6532547 i spend time on national security issues when 70 percent of our oil comes from other countries its like putting a rope around our necks and giving the other end of the rope to our enemies allowing them to jerk us around any time they want
6532548 how can we continue to grow if we keep holding america back look at what weve closed off the outer continental shelf oil shale and oil sands coal gasification well i have a new saying american oil from american soil
6532549 yesterday canada signed a contract for their fourth oil platform in the north atlantic canada also goes after oil shale why would we not go after our own resources
6532550 everyone talks about alternatives and theyre right but we need to develop those alternatives first and while were developing those we should not place america at risk we could easily open americas resources and move forward
6532551 the real danger of 4 a gallon gas is the 700 billion were sending to people who dont like us
6532552 madame speaker this is not about republicans and democrats this is about america and the american people give us a vote on energy independence give us a vote on opening up our energy resources
6532553 republicans support an all of the above energy plan democrats support some of the above republicans want maximum energy production democrats want minimum energy production republicans believe in commonsense conservation democrats believe in government regulation and taxation republicans want incentives for cleaner energy and democrats want pet projects to pick winners and losers
6532554 all we want is a fair vote on an honest plan
6532555 democrats believe americans are to blame for the american energy crisis

6532573 vitamin d concentration may be more strongly linked to frailty related fractures such as hip fractures which tend to occur in much older women
6532574 c terminal telopeptide of type i collagen a marker of bone resorption tended to be higher among case patients with the lowest 25 oh vitamin d concentrations an association that may be driven by higher parathyroid hormone levels in this group

6532579 the conservation of insect pollinators is drawing attention because of reported declines in bee species and the ecosystem services they provide this issue has been brought to a head by recent devastating losses of
6532580 wild bumble bees have also suffered serious declines and circumstantial evidence suggests that pathogen spillover from commercially reared bumble bees which are used extensively to pollinate greenhouse crops is a possible cause
6532581 more than 40 percent of h agen dazs ice cream flavors are dependent on honey bee pollination but honey is not a major ingredient in all of our ice cream
6532582 ingredients like almonds and berries are foods that are bee dependent and since h agen dazs ice cream is dedicated to remaining an all natural brand if we find some of these items difficult to source well eventually have to reexamine our flavor line
6532583 during the first three months of spillover transmission from commercial hives would infect up to 20 percent of wild bumble bees within two km of the greenhouse
6532584 does pathogen spillover from commercially reared bumble bees threaten wild pollinators
6532585 is dietary knowledge enough hunger stress and other roadblocks to healthy eating
6532586 when individuals extend the interval between meals or consume more of their food away from home they are significantly more likely to consume more calories and more calories from solid fats alcohol and added sugars discretionary calories at each eating occasion
6532587 for example going five hours between meals instead of four adds about 52 calories for someone on a diet of 2 000 calories per day extending that interval from four to six hours would add about 91 calories to the meal going longer stretches between meals is also estimated to lower diet quality at each meal
6532588 making specific reference to such situations and suggesting ways to mitigate their effects should enhance the usefulness of educational campaigns designed to improve diet quality
6532589 limiting intake of foods prepared away from home is also estimated to significantly decrease caloric consumption thus another possibility would be to encourage individuals to plan ahead or seek out information about nutrient and caloric content of foods prepared away from home

6532591 a year of exceptionally strong commodity demand market turbulence and price risk
6532592 by bringing to bear our business diversity the full capacity of our global assets strong risk management and a significant increase in capital deployed we operated successfully in the most volatile agricultural and energy markets in decades
6532593 despite tight stocks of many agricultural commodities we maintained reliable supply chains for our customers and created value adding solutions
6532594 if markets are allowed to work todays prices can spark a supply response from farmers a rekindling of public and private investment in agriculture and in rural infrastructure will drive productivity gains

6532606 to just say i dont know on the most divisive issue in america is not a clear enough answer for me
6532607 although religious accommodation has a rich history in the united states it is a principle that is often controversial and difficult to apply
6532608 religious claims for exemptions to state compelled vaccinations demonstrate the difficult challenge of balancing competing claims
6532609 i dont think anyone wanted it to get to this point where were doing a new album and touring unless we could really mean business
6532610 and really make it interesting and not nostalgic but contemporary and current
6532611 were going to give them a run for their money
6532612 theres band that laid the foundation for us and now theres younger bands which wasnt the case the first time around so were in a really unique situation almost like were the middle child i think it works
6532613 bands like lamb of god every time i die theyre like the younger children and the older ones are like the bandss were touring with now heaven and hell judas priest and its just interesting were right in the middle you have these multi generation of bands right now
6532614 but this is an important band and i realized i was surprised to see how important this band was to newer generations not just to the fans but musicians themselves
6532615 sure the audience thats watching date my mom or pimp my ride might not be our target audience but theyre getting aware of it and as they get older some of them will be turned onto the because of that
6532616 i think metal has survived it survived grunge and being considered pass and all the critcisms that it got and its still around and its probably going to be around for a long time so i think the mtv appearance and stuff like that is all a refelction of that
6532617 i have to give credit there the on air promotions department are a bunch of really creative people that kinda get it and really want to bring more interesting stuff to mtv
6532618 the same time i left testament rob halford left judas priest
6532619 i havent told him this but coming back inspired me to come back to testament for a lot of reasons
6532620 he was able to identify himself outside of the band and then come back and still be himself and still be a part of the band i kind of related to that and he had come out of the closet about his sexuality and been accepted id come out of the closet because i liked jazz so i figured if a metal band is gonna accept him being gay they can accept me playing jazz
6532621 at first i was wondering hes become this black metal guy i became this educated jazz musician how is this going to work
6532622 i think we understood were different people now and we had worked together before but it was also a combination of how we worked together before and being who we were at this point in time and just letting that come together
6532623 there was no certainty that it would work but i think it has worked and im very happy about that
6532624 we talked to a lot of people and gathered a lot of input including doug williams we really believe kentucky is a place where morgan can succeed individually and compete for championships

6532642 as far as nato and isaf natos international security assistance force isaf are concerned the allegations in le monde are completely unfounded
6532643 we deny the report we have no information whatsoever that would indicate that the french soldiers were killed by nato planes
6532644 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or wounded were consistent with air delivered ordnance
6532645 we know that the planes supplying what we call close air support could not engage because the french troops were very close to the taliban insurgents
6532646 if they had engaged there might have been considerable collateral damage if bombs had been used
6532647 no french soldier at any time during the incident came on the radio to say that they were taking friendly fire and no french soldier after the event has mentioned to the chain of command that this might have been the case
6532648 there was fire from machine guns on american planes that were guided by american special forces and we have no information that enables us to consider that the french soldiers were killed under fire from nato planes
6532649 fifteen to 20 minutes after the engagement of our forces a support section left the base camp and took around 40 to 50 minutes to get to the scene
6532650 as far as nato and isaf natos international security assistance force isaf are concerned the allegations in le monde are completely unfounded
6532651 we deny the report we have no information whatsoever that would indicate that the french soldiers were killed by nato planes
6532652 running around like a chook with its head cut off
6532653 what is this shift you say you feel what change do you want what is your ultimate goal
6532654 i want to enjoy the men that i see without losing my sense of self
6532655 knowing who i am knowing why i am doing the things i am doing understanding my deeper values and acting and living from them being mindful and conscious being aware of my motivation for my actions at all times and making clear decisions that lead me closer to peace so that i can create a loving stable home for aidan and george
6532656 i obsess get caught up in other people i get caught up in the me they think i am i date and lose myself in these wonderful men its so strange the way you get to know people in fragments sections pieces come alive pieces of a person like there are all these hidden and latent parts to people and like a minefield you never know when they will jump or ooze out
6532657 i am carefree mostly its light laughter and witty its playful this is part of me this is the part of me i want to be sharing with my children but maybe i am spending it all in the wrong places or maybe i can learn to make that energy spread out last longer so it can go to more places
6532658 how might the dynamic you are describing with the kids asking so many questions the need for a different response to notice your own inner signal how might this relate to what you said earlier about a shift in you of not focusing on others obsessing on others so much being more with yourself
6532659 noticing these inner signals and responding differently is abiding with self compassion towards self it is true spiritual practice which is what your goal is here right

6532686 we want to present the best value we can to consumers and to our retail and food service partners but we need to be ultimately able to cover the cost were confronted with
6532687 we are taking aggressive action in food service that included reduced expectations in our full year forecast
6532688 its a good global strategy and a good example of what a u s based food company ought to be doing in order to maintain balance growth in this pretty turbulent food economy
6532689 we need to get the word out that this is likely to happen but as a practical matter leases have been signed and properties bought for this school year
6532690 this is a major concern with many residents it was the number one problem expressed when we visited residents on national night out
6532691 we believe as other christians believe and as paul wrote that god is the father of all
6532692 that means that all beings were created by god and are his spirit children christ on the other hand was the only begotten in the flesh and we worship him as the son of god and the savior of mankind satan is the exact opposite of who christ is and what he stands for

6532698 pricecheck at is designed to suit your mobile phone by not having any big graphics or lots of unnecessary content and by being flexible in its size and format this means it can load quickly on lots of different sized screens and give you the information you need as quickly as possible if you do see something cheaper online you can then visit pricecheck at again on your computer when you get home and order your item from there
6532699 pricecheck at makes use of affiliate relationships with online merchants to generate money every time a user visits a merchants online store we have partnered with kelkoo a leading online price comparision site and compare prices from all over the web
6532700 since my degree in computing in 2002 i worked as a developer and technical director in a number of online companies before using this experience to start 18a productions last year
6532701 pricecheck at is a new service but we aim to have 10 000 visitors a day using the service within 12 months of launching many of these users will be from long tail traffic finding the service through google searches
6532702 recommendation is a critical part of 18as continuing success as happy clients refer other people to us its amazing sometimes how far these recommendations can go and where they can lead pricecheck at doesnt have any level of personalisation at present its designed to be a quick and simple to use service for checking prices on the go
6532703 the biggest challenge with any new online venture is attracting users to your service and getting noticed there are so many startups with great ideas to change the world that it takes something a bit special and a lot of luck to really break through
6532704 this is something that a lot of people were asking at the end of last year but i think the current boom in online advertising is the final realisation of the hype that was the cause of the original online bubble
6532705 at the start of 2008 all the hype was about the mobile internet and i still believe services that make use of the growing number of mobile internet users and provide location aware services will prove very popular
6532706 2008 is very much the year of the api where mashups and access to shared information makes things possible that just wouldnt have been possible before

6532711 the west and united states have an interest in georgia as a country through which an oil pipeline lies and want to push russian influence out of the caucasus
6532712 as a result many western leaders close their eyes to the fact georgia has killed civilians in south ossetia
6532713 the authors go to great lengths to obscure their inability to credibly articulate human influence on the climate
6532714 they do so through selectivity in research alarmist language failure to provide relevance or context to many of their claims and generally throughout with transparent advocacy in tone and content
6532715 the report claims it doesnt provide official recommendations for government action
6532716 yet the document continually commingles science and advocacy for regulatory controls on carbon dioxide in fact the cheerleading begins on the cover page with an intentionally exaggerated graph of global temperatures

6532718 the muse arouses the intellect and brings colonnaded landscapes and a false taste of laurel very often intellect is poetrys enemy because it is too much given to imitation because it lifts the poet to a throne of sharp edges and makes him oblivious of the fact that he may suddenly be devoured by ants or a great arsenic lobster may fall on his head
6532719 chief investigator gary howard told the knoxville news sentinel a drug sniffing dog smelled something on the truck during a traffic stop near crossville last week a search of the vehicle found no drugs but did find the cash in a hidden compartment
6532720 multiple agencies were involved in the stop and search howard said the money will likely be awarded by a court to those agencies

6532752 i surprisingly didnt throw up after imbibing three shots of tequila and a beer before hand
6532753 while it remained behind the coalition as the preferred party on these issues its disadvantage was small and many more voters saw no difference between the major parties
6532754 there were clearly many factors that contributed to the australian labor partys 2007 election success but one was the partys increasing credibility with voters on national security issues
6532755 clearly the rise in the numbers seeing the us as a threat is motivated less by the belief that the us harbours military ambitions towards australia and more by anti american sentiment fostered by disenchantment with the fta free trade agreement and opposition to the iraq war
6532756 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6532757 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6532758 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6532759 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6532760 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6532761 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6532762 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6532763 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6532764 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6532765 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6532766 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6532767 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6532768 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6532769 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6532770 the rudd government should bring in its main legislation to overturn the howard governments ir laws as soon as possible

6532777 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6532778 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6532779 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6532780 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6532781 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6532782 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6532783 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6532784 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6532785 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6532786 who are open to doing something on the production side
6532787 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6532788 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6532789 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6532790 outside the democratic national committee t boone will be on the stage with carl pope the executive director of the sierra club and john podesta the president and chief executive office of american progress
6532791 the pickens plan has a mixture of extremely good and important elements and concepts that simply dont comport with energy reality
6532792 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
6532793 is too much of a jump its not a good enough alternative
6532794 if youre limited to 160 channels versus unlimited channels its tricky to see how one would survive in the face of the other
6532795 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6532796 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6532797 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6532798 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6532799 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6532800 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6532801 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6532802 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6532803 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6532804 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6532805 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6532806 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6532807 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6532808 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6532809 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6532810 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6532811 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6532812 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6532813 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6532814 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6532815 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6532816 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6532817 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6532818 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6532819 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6532820 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6532821 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6532822 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6532823 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6532824 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6532825 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6532826 this is a case that illustrates everything that is wrong with the death penalty in texas
6532827 does not himself kill attempt to kill or intend that a killing take place or lethal force will be employed
6532828 thats why i think this issue may come back to the supreme court
6532829 the death penalty to me is the easy way out
6532830 if you had to be down there and get up every morning as hot and humid as it is knowing that you are going to spend the rest of your life locked up under those conditions thats punishment thats what i think my son would want for him
6532831 im not a christian but im not an atheist either
6532832 im weary of hearing that accidental old aphorism of mine im an atheist thank god its outworn dead leaves in 1951 i made a small film called mexican bus ride about a village too poor to support a church and a priest the place was serene because no one suffered from guilt its guilt we must escape from not god
6532833 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore
6532834 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6532835 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6532836 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6532837 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6532838 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6532839 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6532840 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6532841 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6532842 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6532843 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6532844 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6532845 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6532846 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6532847 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6532848 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6532849 fight in the cause of god those who fight you and slay them wherever ye catch them and fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression and there prevail justice and faith in god
6532850 fighting is prescribed for you and ye dislike it but it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you and that ye love a thing which is bad for you but god knoweth and ye know not
6532851 then fight in the cause of god and know that god heareth and knoweth all things
6532852 and if ye are slain or die in the way of god forgiveness and mercy from god are far better than all they could amass and if ye die or are slain lo it is unto god that ye are brought together
6532853 think not of those who are slain in gods way as dead nay they live finding their sustenance in the presence of their lord
6532854 those who have fought or been slain verily i will blot out from them their iniquities and admit them into gardens with rivers flowing beneath a reward from the presence of god
6532855 let those fight in the cause of god who sell the life of this world for the hereafter to him who fighteth in the cause of god whether he is slain or gets victory soon shall we give him a reward of great value those who believe fight in the cause of god and those who reject faith fight in the cause of evil so fight ye against the friends of satan feeble indeed is the cunning of satan
6532856 they but wish that ye should reject faith as they do and thus be on the same footing as they
6532857 not equal are those believers who sit at at home and receive no hurt and those who strive and fight in the cause of god with their goods and their persons
6532858 it really knocks you out i guess the people who are more familiar with it are really impressed and i am too but i must tell a lot to learn but its easier this time to learn
6532859 the competitors here in florida are a bunch of dimwits they didnt bail her out and they cant figure out why someone came from california came to do it theyre just idiots they say dont bail her out or well kill you you son of a bleep they want to try to

6532873 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6532874 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6532875 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6532876 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6532877 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

6532887 correct stat based progression is not an accurate way to determine how good a player is or how good a player can be an average running back with decent abilities could have a great year if there is a great offensive line and fb in front of him happens all the time in the nfl then you could have a running back who is actually better and more skilled but doesnt put up the same stats cause he has no line and no team around him now you want ea to reward the lesser rb because he put up good stats rather than the rb who is actually better but just cant put up the stats cause his team blows is that an accurate way of determining the overall rating of a running back i dont think so i could understand if a rookie running back came in and ran for 1200 yards with the chiefs or the dolphins or the falcons yes he would deserve a big boost in rating and a stat based progression should be determined if so however i dont think ea is smart enough to make this work properly

6532899 this outbreak is a wake up call to the conservatives that their plan to cut programs at the expense of food safety has the potential to jeopardize the lives of canadians

6532939 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6532940 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6532941 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience

6532988 those who want to transact business with us are always very suspicious
6532989 the nigerian government frowns very seriously on these scams and every day tries to track down those who are involved

6532996 if we wish to stay out of the lit areas which i would personally prefer that would mean travel to the north we would need to cross a lit corridor but that should be manageable
6532997 north sounds good ibben id like to put some distance between ourselves and those plant people
6532998 it cannot hurt to scout the areas around the lit shaft areas to determine if their are any hostile forces present let us head north as ibben suggested but keep as close to the shaft as possible while remaining in the darkened areas
6532999 we predicted that up to 30 of land birds may go extinct by 2100 due to a combination of climate change and habitat loss most worryingly 79 of bird species we predicted to go extinct are not currently considered threatened with extinction

6533004 while expansion of biofuels into productive tropical ecosystems will always lead to net carbon emissions for decades to centuries expansion into degraded or already cultivated land will provide almost immediate carbon savings
6533005 the reason for allowing the order to lapse is that i dont think it is necessary to create additional special categories or special rights

6533012 about 4 percent of indian lands have been deforested up from zero in 2003 and this could grow considerably
6533013 the cultural threat to the indians of mining activity is far greater than the environmental threat
6533014 opening up these lands would be great for the industry
6533015 almost half of mato grosso and para states which are full of minerals today are blocked off
6533016 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
6533017 im not sure ill have to check with my staff
6533018 i guess if you think that being rich means you got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have
6533019 then it is not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6533020 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6533021 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6533022 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans

6533024 the positive part i take away is that there is a bigger gap between evansville and a narrower gap to illinois state
6533025 polls are polls though we finished sixth last season thats just how it is
6533026 now we can work on more advanced shots and different things
6533027 we can start training on things that we will need to be at the top of the league that maturity is definitely going to help us
6533028 we should make the poor uncomfortable and kick them out of poverty
6533029 the only thing that separates us from the animals is our ability to accessorize
6533030 a dress should be tight enough to show youre a woman but loose enough to show youre a lady
6533031 try something totally different and lets see where it goes
6533032 documented it with pictures and video to tell the story of what fay was all about
6533033 the radar is shooting through a storm at a certain height you know the radar beam is above the ground and the satellite is looking down from space and one of the big problems is when a hurricane hits a lot of the regular weather stations you use go off line because the power goes out
6533034 so folks like this provide us other ways of getting information
6533035 we want to contribute to the science more than anything when its all said and done
6533036 hey people weve uploaded a first teaser from the studio on youtube check it out below the small teaser shows you what you have to expect from us nothing but brutality more stuff soon be prepared

6533041 im always running into women who think im younger than i am so i dont want to disillusion them
6533042 all the judges on the original panel have voted to deny the petition
6533043 none of the judges in regular active service has requested a vote on the petition for rehearing en banc
6533044 hey man you look so lean and tired you should eat vitamin and protein tablets my company has lot of tablets that can help you gain weight
6533045 you cannot negotiate anything about final status if you dont talk about jerusalem final status consists primarily i believe of jerusalem and refugees if you want to postpone jerusalem you postpone refugees really you are not dealing with the problem you have to discuss these issues and that is exactly where the trade off has to be made
6533046 i still favor a two state solution and will continue to do so but to the extent that you discover its not practical anymore or that its not going to happen you start to think about what the alternatives are
6533047 but on the other hand if we are looking at what is happening on the ground in israel and the occupied territories you see things happening in the opposite direction as if they are not connected to reality thought is running in one direction reality in the other
6533048 we can fight for equal rights rights of existence return and equality and we could take it slowly over the years and there could be a peaceful movement like in south africa
6533049 i think one should maybe begin on the palestinian side to begin a debate to reengage in the idea of one state
6533050 it so happens that fatah in particular the mainstream party and the only viable alternative to extremes on the left or on the right now needs a strategy an ideology
6533051 these are isolated incidents but they do reflect a major sickness in our jerusalem arab society
6533052 what is the driving force behind a two state solution the fact that it seems more acceptable to a majority of people on both sides and therefore more applicable the primary motivation is to minimize human suffering this is what we should all be looking at if there will be a one state solution it will not come today or tomorrow its a long protracted thing not the ideal solution unless in an ideal world people really want to be together then it is the ideal solution the best solution the one that causes the least pain and that can actually be instrumental to a one state solution is to have peace now and acceptance of one another on the basis of two states
6533053 fifty 100 200 years down the road there will be some kind of conclusion sometime in the future however far away this future is i believe well be living at peace with one another in some way or another i am not sure how whether in one state or two states or in a confederation of states but people finally will come to live at peace in the meantime we will simply cause pain to one another its tragic it is very tragic because we know we can do it now that today it is possible with some guts leadership vision we can make it happen today we can reach a peaceful solution today the arab peace initiative proposed in 2002 is a fantastic chance the palestinians have adopted it theyll go with it all the way it is a perfect chance it doesnt even mention right of return it is even better than the ayalon nusseibeh plan but i am willing to accept it
6533054 because for israel however important jerusalem may be the primary factor is the jewish character of the state
6533055 the facts on the ground are making the situation irreversible
6533056 take the clinton parameters palestinian neighborhoods are palestinian sovereignty jewish neighborhoods are jewish sovereignty they are acceptable in principle but with realities on the ground like the expulsion of arab families from their homes in the sheikh jarrah neighborhood and the inhabitation of those areas by jewish settlers its going to be unacceptable on a practical level thats why we dont have time
6533057 ramallahs reaction was a bit worried they called me a few times a bit worried
6533058 we have a terrible situation our political bible our platform our moral values we need to be brought together again if not for creating a state then for our own sanity and for own values as a people apart from in ramallah everybody is living under very bad conditions the occupation is terrible the siege is everywhere pressure as it is the europeans are financing the occupation and the europeans are happy because they feel theyre doing something it cleans their conscience and the israelis are happy because theyre not paying for it and the palestinians are happy because they are getting their wages paid it keeps the economy going and people are getting complacent about it its dead money going after dead money
6533059 i said i want to tell you what you can do to transform yourself from a payer into a player make your money payments conditional on tangible progress in the peace process
6533060 i was in brussels i gave a talk and i said to the europeans if you want to pass on money do it only on the condition we build a state in which case it makes sense for you to spend money to build us an international airport but if in the end there isnt going to be an independent palestinian state why waste your money waste your money if you need to on integrating us into israeli society makes more sense pay the money for us to become part of israel to have equal rights raise our level of education bring our standards of living up but to have the pa taking all this money creating all this debt makes no sense maybe the europeans should link the aid they are giving us to real progress in peace talks so that both the israelis and the palestinians will be shocked out of their complacency or lack of commitment
6533061 the pa has no use if we fail to reach a peace agreement by the end of this year i believe it would be best to go back to the period when we were living happily under occupation we had a small civil administration they were paying back some 20 million a year to the israeli treasury so they were making money off us today we are creating year after year bigger deficits we are spending billions we have 160 000 employees half of them are security personnel who give us no security whatsoever we are spending masses of money on guns which we only use against each other and which provide us no security the whole thing is a mess
6533062 people in jerusalem why should they attach themselves to the muqata to ramallah
6533063 i was still hoping because before he went to the labor party he came and spoke to me i like this about him i knew what he was doing people were pushing him for a long time trying to get him into the system and he resisted but then at one stage i think he made up his mind maybe i can lead the labor party and then this is the best place for me to be i said fine do it i was unhappy that he became marginalized as minister without portfolio
6533064 would come to the palestinian people and say i initialed such a document
6533065 i believe that on israeli side olmert could do the same we dont know whether both leaders will be reelected but its worth doing even if theyre not because at least we know weve given this peace agreement a chance
6533066 i agree with sari nusseibeh that time is running out for the two state solution
6533067 i share his view that olmert missed a chance to get an agreement due to efforts to insure his own political survival the labor party will not succeed in getting back in power by attacking the other parties but only by raising the common banner of security and political agreements
6533068 a large number of them see nothing but darkness when the sun goes down
6533069 now we can wait to set up large thermal power plants extend the grid to all the villages and i am not too sure with the level of poverty that exists whether people will be able to afford getting connections in their homes but on the other hand today s technology allows us to give these homes lighting through the use of solar lanterns and solar torches we believe that this is something human society must pursue with urgency and more than that india should pursue with urgency
6533070 you cant do that thats not the way we perceive being a champion
6533071 i dont feel like hes bolt being disrespectful he deserves to dance

6533075 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6533076 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county
6533077 if it was a category 1 2 or 3 hurricane making a direct hit on jacksonville youd have something
6533078 this is the first day we can actually see the tops of the roads
6533079 were pulling in our plants and porch furniture making sure we have our supplies and gas for the generator
6533080 i still think we all need to stay on our toes
6533081 were making a peaceful protest to ask the russians to leave
6533082 here in the city we have not seen sign of russians leaving
6533083 they promised to pull out by the end of tomorrow
6533084 georgia itself drove a nail in the casket of its statehood and territorial integrity georgia has ruined itself that is why there can be no talk any more about a possibility to live together in one country
6533085 if there is anyone who cast doubt upon and dealt a serious blow to georgias territorial integrity it is mikheil nikolayevich saakashvili

6533087 even though market conditions have definitely become more difficult the past year we are happy to see that many professional services organizations and agencies are looking at this as an opportunity to strengthen their internal systems and procedures and invest in business solutions like maconomy
6533088 onalert is a simple secure way for authorized school officials to issue emergency alerts
6533089 the wall mounted led displays are visible from over 100 feet inexpensive to install and easy to operate
6533090 theres a right and wrong good and bad way to do this
6533091 unfortunately most people are using the wrong or bad way and screwing it all up
6533092 the huge marketing myth everyone swears by is that backend sales are made to your customers only months sometimes years after the initial sale its not true and the speed and power of the internet enables you to compress your marketing cycle
6533093 along with all the things that parents know are important for helping keep their kids healthy like washing hands and getting enough sleep flu vaccination should be right up there but this survey shows us that we still have a lot of educating to do
6533094 as a community we need to do a better job spreading the word about how important a yearly flu vaccine can be in helping protect kids and ourselves from influenza
6533095 flooding has caused great heartache and disruption to our farmers in recent days
6533096 i want to reassure them that i am doing everything i can
6533097 i have also met with the ulster farmers union to gain their appreciation of whether the flooding has any long term impact on the industry
6533098 i would intend to make my assessment available to my executive colleagues so that we can jointly consider the way forward

6533103 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy
6533104 what we have accomplished in this agreement is the most advanced version of any
6533105 because the u s negotiators indeed showed a great deal of flexibility and understanding
6533106 we recognize that the government still has to review this agreement and well await that process and then it obviously has to go to the council of representatives
6533107 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6533108 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6533109 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6533110 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6533111 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6533112 i said what the heck is that and there was an alligator floating by
6533113 i took my flashlight and was like youve got to be kidding me a big old alligator swimming around here
6533114 this storm is going to be with us for a while

6533123 as you know the elite hands of justice are looking to expand the team
6533124 there has been in a shift in the last couple of years more and more young teens are showing up with powers
6533125 we have a lot of policing to do not that every one of them is going to turn to a life of crime or a life of heroics for that matter but we need to keep an eye out
6533126 i am my own person sir and the previous costume was a bit impractical
6533127 a mini skirt halter top and go go boots arent exactly good for flying sir
6533128 well the black sets off your blond hair nicely and gives you a certain look we want someone memorable to the public
6533129 with all due respect sir i dont see how my love of dark eye makeup and red lipstick has any bearings on whether or not id be a good addition to the team
6533130 your work with the red knights and the power squad is impressive your apprehension stats are beyond average and your power levels are above a seven which is excellent strength and flight correct
6533131 based on your pre interviews the magnificent white heat and aphrodite have already given their approval for your membership which only leaves my decision
6533132 you did read in the contract that you must perform two years of training before you are considered a full member of our roster correct
6533133 i think i remember something like that in between the liability clause and the alias patent agreement
6533134 we require all new members to work with the reincarnist tour of duty they like to call it be weve all done it i suppose youve heard the rumors about him
6533135 youre being kind mad is what the papers say and there are some on and off our team who would agree but hes the smartest man on earth and no wonder possessing the intelligence of the ages unfortunately the business of being reborn does have its drawbacks as he forgets a bit with each new life however youre getting him at a good time hes been robert elliot for twenty years now so you wont have to face working with him at the start of a new life its always hard on those that get him at that age
6533136 i thought he was reborn as a young man of twenty sir not a baby
6533137 oh he is but hes usually a little confused at first forgets how the magic works
6533138 ah but you wont have to worry about that hes forty in the best shape of his life and smart as a whip i have confidence youll get along just fine getting training from the reincarnist really hones your detective skills always helpful to a hero as well as your powers hes officially on the inactive list but does special assignments for the team as well as some patrolling of his own sector youll live with him in his house in covo city not a hardship let me tell you the man is always a billionaire playboy no matter what life hes in and this way you can work with him on his assignments
6533139 ill have gladys work up your papers and clearance level have you notified the power squad yet
6533140 i didnt want to count my chickens before they were hatched sir
6533141 ill have aphrodite notify them you are working with us from now on your address is correct on your application form
6533142 good ill send someone over to your apartment pick up your things we can make arrangements to sublet if necessary
6533143 oil is the driver and then it depends on a series of other factors that are kind of like magnifiers
6533144 all three reports tend to indicate that were bottoming out but that there is no real end in sight and thats what i think the market has to get used to
6533145 he was a humble man what wrong did he do to anyone why was he punished these cruel people have taken away the great shadow of my father
6533146 all around the gate i saw blood and human flesh people helped the injured and took them in their cars and even on motorbikes to the hospital
6533147 seven or eight people were already dead and another 10 people were breathing their last
6533148 there are two torn bodies lying there which we believe are those of the suicide bombers
6533149 only innocent people die when the pakistan army carries out airstrikes in bajur or swat
6533150 if the army is really fond of fighting it should send ground forces to see how we fight
6533151 the future of this coalition is linked to the restoration of judges
6533152 if the judges are not restored we will prefer to sit on opposition benches
6533153 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
6533154 this nation was built on a foundation of free speech the first principle of free speech is protected conscience
6533155 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6533156 planned parenthood continues to be concerned that the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6533157 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6533158 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6533159 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience

6533189 im going to let the campaign speak for the campaign
6533190 if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have different perspective
6533191 i will put my judgment on foreign policy over the last five years against john mccains anytime anytime
6533192 i think an objective analysis would say ive been right a lot more than he has for all his years in washington
6533193 who goes around spending all their their time insulting people
6533194 two years ago obama bought a mansion on the south side in the kenwood neighborhood from a doctor on the same day antoin tony rezkos wife rita rezko bought the vacant lot next door from the same seller the doctor had listed the properties for sale together he sold the house to obama for 300 000 below the asking price the doctor got his asking price on the lot from rezkos wife
6533195 on the same day obama closed on his house rezkos wife bought the adjacent empty lot meeting the condition of the seller who wanted to sell both properties at the same time
6533196 later the obamas bought a 10 foot by 150 foot piece of the lot for 104 500 an appraisal put the value of the strip at 40 500 a spokesman said but obama considered it fair to pay one sixth of the original price for one sixth of the lot
6533197 a federal jury today convicted developer antoin tony rezko of corruption charges for trading on his clout as a top adviser and fundraiser to gov rod blagojevich rezkos guilty verdict on 16 of 24 corruption counts could have broad repercussions for blagojevich who made rezko a central player in his kitchen cabinet it could also prove a political liability for u s sen barack obama who once counted rezko as a friend and fundraiser as the likely democratic presidential nominee heads into the general election campaign against republican john mccain the jury convicted rezko of wire and mail fraud money laundering and aiding and abetting bribery he was acquitted of attempted extortion
6533198 when obama and his wife michelle a hospital executive decided to move with their two young girls from their hyde park condominium they chose a spacious three story georgian revival home on a tree lined street in the kenwood neighborhood not far from the university of chicago the owner had listed the house nearly 100 years old with four fireplaces and a wine cellar and an adjacent lot as separate parcels
6533199 as a state senator barack obama wrote letters to city and state officials supporting his political patron tony rezkos successful bid to get more than 14 million from taxpayers to build apartments for senior citizens
6533200 obamas letters written nearly nine years ago for the first time show the democratic presidential hopeful did a political favor for rezko a longtime friend campaign fund raiser and client of the law firm where obama worked who was indicted last fall on federal charges that accuse him of demanding kickbacks from companies seeking state business under gov blagojevich
6533201 the letters appear to contradict a statement last december from obama who told the chicago tribune that in all the years hes known rezko ive never done any favors for him
6533202 for the first time sen barack obama put a figure friday to the amount of campaign contributions that indicted political fund raiser tony rezko raised for the senators campaigns and the number about 250 000 was far more than he previously acknowledged
6533203 wed obama and rezko continue to have lunches or breakfasts wed talk about politics wed talk about family
6533204 in terms of other than lunch or breakfast he and i had socially michelle and i probably had a couple of dinners or two or three dinners with rezko and his wife during the course of this six or seven or eight years
6533205 barack and michelle obama visited their home in lake geneva once for the day
6533206 in the next couple of months we see that there might be potentials to pick up distressed assets or companies that may need some help

6533226 the club just opened in october 2006 so this is only our second year doing it here
6533227 ive worked other places and its common for comedy clubs usually at some point in the year to hold a comedy contest like this
6533228 to keep it fair we limit it to people that have not worked paid feature weeks
6533229 that would obviously skew the ability for somebody to win if we allowed a headliner or somebody that has been working as a feature for a couple of years

6533259 a growing body of new research suggests that something more collaborative is going on that we think not just with our brains but with our bodies a series of studies the latest published in november has shown that children can solve math problems better if they are told to use their hands while thinking another recent study suggested that stage actors remember their lines better when they are moving and in one study published last year subjects asked to move their eyes in a specific pattern while puzzling through a brainteaser were twice as likely to solve it the term most often used to describe this new model of mind is embodied cognition

6533335 implementation of the highly qualified teacher provisions of the no child left behind act
6533336 a highly qualified teacher as one who has 1 fulfilled the states certification and licensing requirements 2 obtained at least a bachelors degree and 3 demonstrated subject matter expertise
6533337 research shows that teacher subject matter knowledge is greatly associated with student learning

6533365 major milestone in the adoption and deployment of open social throughout the social web
6533366 should the term open source mean without an opinion about use i dont think so open sources power is that many people are thinking about common problems but they need to document why they chose the solutions they did and why it works for them
6533367 problems with the use of sizing of graduated compression stockings are common throughout the country and this study is one of the first to systematically analyze the problems and recommend ways to improve practice
6533368 based on the study findings we recommend that knee length stockings be the standard length used and that the education of nurses and patients about the proper use of stockings be improved

6533377 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6533378 planned parenthood continues to be concerned that the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6533379 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6533380 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6533381 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience

6533387 preliminary surveys show that the students who play immune attack show an increase in knowledge when compared with students who did not play the game after playing the game students also showed a higher interest in biology

6533390 research indicates that university scholars have already developed a wealth of better teaching methods including ones using technology but academic institutions and schools have failed to adopt many of them because of institutional and cultural roadblocks
6533391 this was a short term study without placebo so it shows that a longer term trial should be done
6533392 we are planning a larger long term study that will be international in the united states and canada and also in europe
6533393 we selected the best ones did chemistry to modify them and came up with ptc124
6533394 the findings presented here offer important information related to bone health for premenopausal women undergoing adjuvant endocrine therapy
6533395 the bottom line is that there is no evidence from this work the largest study published to date that the cholesterol lowering ability of statins increases the risk of cancer
6533396 lack an effect on cancer risk across all levels of on treatment ldl cholesterol
6533397 the so called j shaped curve has been seen repeatedly when cholesterol has been measured
6533398 in such studies persons with the lowest ldl cholesterol on entry show the highest death rate from cancer than those with higher ldl levels
6533399 this is especially true of cancers involving the blood cell system but it also occurs with cancer of the kidney and elsewhere
6533400 whatever the mechanism the main point should be that studies of much larger numbers of people in statin trials find no excess of cancers
6533401 we need to do a much better job of keeping track of these relationships
6533402 in major trials of statins some do not even report on the number of cancers we need a lot more research in this area in terms of biology virtually nothing is known
6533403 what we need is patient level data to see whether a pattern emerges of different risks at different ldl levels
6533404 but when we give medications to millions we need information about risks versus benefits
6533405 there are some question marks and they may change the risk benefit ratio for some patients
6533406 important uncertainties exist regarding the exact benefit of silver coated endotracheal tubes
6533407 consequently silver coated tubes should not be viewed as the definitive answer for ventilator associated pneumonia prevention and until additional data confirm the clinical effectiveness and cost benefit of these devices their issue should be restricted to high risk patients treated in icus with benchmark value based infection rates that remain above institutional goals despite implementation of a comprehensive strategy of usual preventive measures to prevent ventilator associated pneumonia

6533411 since the safety and effectiveness of rhbmp for treatment of cervical spine conditions has not been demonstrated and in light of the serious adverse events described above fda recommends that practitioners either use approved alternative treatments or consider enrolling as investigators in approved clinical studies
6533412 in view of the fda notification concerning life threatening complications of rhbmp in cervical fusion we are encouraged that the profile of our allogeneic cells in the cervical interbody space may translate into a safe and effective clinical alternative
6533413 in addition the very low dose of allogeneic cells that were effective in the interbody procedure to obtain cervical fusion makes this target market a very attractive and high margin new commercial opportunity for mesoblast

6533426 when we opted out we told major league baseball it was not a negotiating tactic we need a new deal
6533427 baseball is really really important digital content because of the volume of games and the time of year they play
6533428 if they have the rights in a country they have the rights to stream
6533429 this is the first time we ve allowed someone to stream live games and we do it with a lot of thought they understand rights and they treat rights appropriately while i think it s a value for value exchange and its fair for both sides we wouldnt have done that with many other potential partners
6533430 espn and fox are such large national partners were duty bound to negotiate with them theyre so vital to the industry that if they wanted to do something wed have to work with them very hard
6533431 putting this stuff online doesnt really keep people from watching your television bowman i must give him credit also understands he can build his online business and work with me on building our online business

6533433 we believe in our content and were grateful that espn does too
6533434 its not cannibalistic if all of it is ours its hard to resist things that are good for your customers if you keep trying to keep people from tivo ing things or not get games ultimately youre going to make your customers mad
6533435 we understand the importance of local rights economically philosophically and baseball was wise to set up the system they have when the time is right and in the manner that is right it will occur maybe in five years but no one knows there are so many important stakeholders her the fans the rights holders the affiliates theres just a lot of stakeholders here maybe the nba will start down a good path and well see
6533436 if we have exclusive rights we expect to be the only way to get there

6533446 given the significant rally in the u s dollar that has taken place over the last two and a half weeks i think the market has gotten a little bit over extended here and weve entered into a bit of a corrective phase
6533447 for the most part the main catalyst still comes back to price action in the commodity markets and with a substantial spike higher in oil today were seeing not only the u s dollar weaken off against the major currencies but thats been a benefit for the canadian dollar given the positive correlation between crude and the loonie
6533448 i think oil prices are finding some sort of base
6533449 and we do have some issues going on now the u s dollar declining again on the back of mortgage financiers freddie mac and fannie mae and this potential bailout

6533486 but i am reasonably certain my friends that i own exactly sixteen patek philippe watches
6533487 there are always some crazy things i get flashed quite often luckily mostly from girls
6533488 the reason we are leaving so soon is because we have work to do at home
6533489 i work at the basilica on the campus of the university of notre dame
6533490 we came out to volunteer in park city because holy cross sister mary ann pajakowski secretary of holy cross ministries in salt lake city told us they would like some sisters to help with the summer reading program because there are so many children who need help we are both retired teachers but you do not lose the knack of teaching because you are doing something else
6533491 we met sister suzanne brennen director of holy cross ministries and sr mary ann at a holy cross meeting held in chicago in november
6533492 they asked us if we were interested in coming to help the children learn to read we like to do at least one ministry other than our own during the year because it gives us something special to do and we both like working with little children a lot
6533493 the children here are slow to average but we work with some on a one to one basis hoping that will help them with their regular school work
6533494 we think it is very important for children to learn their phonics because then they can sound out the words they do not know
6533495 they need that foundation or they will be lost from one grade to the next
6533496 we also eat lunch with them so we are not to strange to them
6533497 it is interesting to see how they interact with the other children how they play before class starts what they do during their breaks and what they do while swimming and hiking
6533498 having all these activities encourages them to come to school during the summer
6533499 most of the children who are enrolled in the summer program participate in our after school program during the school year which is held at saint mary of the assumption church
6533500 we have 95 students enrolled this summer and they are primarily from jeremy ranch elementary school and parleys park elementary school because of transportation limitations we also work closely with the english as a second language esl teachers to select the students
6533501 we try to enroll the students based on needs because there is a lot more need than there is room to provide services
6533502 so it works out that we have just about the right capacity
6533503 these students also include the students who will enter ecker hill middle school in park city
6533504 we have about 15 youth volunteers who attend treasure mountain junior high school who were previous participants in our program or older siblings of students who are now in the program
6533505 there are some key areas we work on with the students
6533506 the one that really got the program started was providing a safe healthy environment for the kids so they would not be home alone and unsupervised
6533507 we are also working with the parents more because if we do not there is a piece missing the parents really need to be involved as well
6533508 so we have offered some parenting classes to teach the parents how to be familiar with the needs of the students that is something we will focus more on in the future we want the parents to be a good influence for the children and be supportive and encourage them at home
6533509 the students attend summer school seven hours a day five days each week and they go to school for 10 months
6533510 we want them to have fun for this to be a positive experience and something they are going to enjoy
6533511 park city racquet club has also offered free services to teach the kids tennis lessons
6533512 we also are taking them on hikes in deer valley park city and on the trail behind the church
6533513 let us love not in word or speech but in truth and action
6533514 each day the children rotated through music arts and crafts science projects games and story telling
6533515 we had a group of five teenagers who have been helping all week who acted out a story each day the students also spent time in class to review the story of the day and do an activity based on the story
6533516 each year for vacation bible school we choose a mission project
6533517 we raised money by asking the children to do extra chores at home to earn money to bring in
6533518 we raised money for study hour for the boys and girls at the sandy club
6533519 the boys and girls at the sandy club come in after school to do their homework as well as receive tutoring
6533520 and all the people who have been waiting to be resettled end up coming at this time we have asked the federal government to spread out the arrivals but that just isnt happening fifty percent of our arrivals come during the last quarter
6533521 i spent two years in kenya and provided services there less than a year at the end of 1993 batar and his family were sponsored by catholic relief services and were resettled in utah through catholic community services
6533522 at the time they were processing hundreds of thousands of refugees
6533523 we didnt know where we were going to be sent but i knew english and i had the skills so i knew we would survive no matter where we went
6533524 i got a lot of exercise because i had to try out every treadmill we produced
6533525 since the great tragedy of sept 11 2001 refugees have found it more strict and more difficult to move on from the camps because everyone is investigated by homeland security it causes them many delays homeland security and the f b i who do background checks on everyone seeking naturalization have a huge backlog of cases
6533526 recently we filed complaints for 24 people whose cases should have been completed and they should have been allowed to get their naturalization papers we won them all but they would not have gotten their citizenship if we had not spoken up on their behalf
6533527 when our 24 complaints got to the court the judge agreed with us and immigration services had to comply after the judge gave his orders
6533528 we encourage them to participate in a federal program that provides them with a certain amount of money and encourages them to be self sufficient
6533529 in most cases refugees want to become self sufficient as soon as possible last year 99 percent of our refugees became self sufficient within six months they want to succeed
6533530 we are going to see more refugees seeking resettlement next year
6533531 it is estimated that more than 2 million iraqis and people from neighboring countries will seek resettlement next year this year 12 000 iraqis were promised resettlement around the country and so far only 6 000 have arrived so we will see more and more coming in
6533532 in the early 90s we were resettling a lot of people from eastern europe because thats where the trouble was people seek to leave places of great poverty or where there is war
6533533 in the mid and late 90s we were resettling people from africa and afghanistan
6533534 some people come to us with good educations and good skills others have spent so much time in the refugee camps they come with no skills and no education agencies have to tailor programs for the new groups they get
6533535 the parish probably because of its connection to the university has a rapid turnover therefore we always have new people willing to help and get involved
6533536 but we do not proselytize we let the families know theyre welcome to attend services but are not required
6533537 we have to understand that they are not homeless because they want to be i heard most of us are two paychecks away from being homeless
6533538 anything you do to help those in need will bless you
6533539 the homeless who are disheveled on the streets make up only about 10 of the homeless population
6533540 as adults we have the responsibility to take care of the kids in our community
6533541 this is a very unique program because we try to maintain the family as a unit
6533542 its a hands on justice approach to an issue and its so in line with the basic tenants mary and joseph could be said to be homeless they were looking for shelter
6533543 anything you do to help those in need and who are in a hard situation will bless you
6533544 i enjoy being a friendly face and the fellowship with the families
6533545 this is a great program because you get to share with families who have had one traumatic experience in life and you can provide them at least three months of stability comfort and counseling
6533546 the mentors are trained volunteers who will be a positive influence in their lives and will keep us in touch
6533547 i love the program because we try to make everything comfortable safe and welcoming to help them
6533548 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession
6533549 the decline in the leading index should therefore not be interpreted as a sign the outlook is quickly deteriorating
6533550 thats critical while consumers may be cautious and conservative in their spending as long as the rate does not spike there should be enough income growth to keep the economy muddling along
6533551 were not in competition with the other libraries in fact we have a back up collection of books the public libraries have access to if they need them we provide services for people who are blind or otherwise disabled perhaps they cant hold a book or turn a page we offer audio tapes and we are soon moving to digital books
6533552 if a person has a cast on their arm and cannot hold a book or for some reason they cannot turn a page and their doctor will certify their disability they can become a client here
6533553 a person can apply to become a client on line and get books or audio tapes through the mail
6533554 they are available for inter library loans or loans to our own clients we have fiction and non fiction books just as every public library would have in fact with our braille library we have some of the best services available in the whole country
6533555 we not only need volunteers to read our books on tape we need volunteers to help us repair our recording and playing equipment
6533556 and we need volunteers who make sure all the tapes are re wound and begin at the beginning
6533557 many of the books we record here are those with some local interest
6533558 after theyre recorded they can be submitted to the national library
6533559 they will go to clients with digital talking book machines
6533560 the utah state library for the blind records hundreds of books and magazines every year thanks to the help of volunteer narrators
6533561 volunteer narrators translate the written word to the spoken word in a way that is consistent with the intent of the author the material must be read clearly accurately precisely and in its proper order with accurate accounting for each word in the text
6533562 volunteers work under the direction of the volunteer coordinator who assigns tasks sets priorities and provides guidance with projects

6533565 what were seeing is a bit of a belated catch up in canada to the surge in global food prices we saw earlier this year
6533566 because even with the pullback in grain prices theyre still well up from a year ago
6533567 some of that strength in grain prices earlier this year was for real
6533568 partly its just a matter of food companies making sure that its not just a fluke thats going to be quickly reversed
6533569 grain prices make up only a small share about two per cent of the actual final food price
6533570 unfortunately canadians are going to be experiencing continued pressure on food prices in the future
6533571 earlier this year we were faced by just some astronomical unprecedented commodity price increases
6533572 weve seen some relief in the area of wheat pricing its only double what it was last year versus being triple or quadruple the price
6533573 we are big users of both electricity and natural gas as well as producing a fresh product our industry has trucks on the road everyday delivering
6533574 when you look at energy in total theres been significant pressure on all forms of energy but the most acute of late has been transportation costs
6533575 packaging if its plastic its petroleum based so theres been pressures there
6533576 were starting to see the results of all those inflationary price pressures materialize at the retail level
6533577 mind you we still have an incredibly incredibly competitive retail environment
6533578 so just how much of that pressure will materialize at the retail level thats something for the market to decide
6533579 its possible that some of the grain prices we saw earlier this year were in bubble territory
6533580 is that even with a short pullback theyre still in some cases double where they were a year ago
6533581 were faced with on the agriculture side increasing demand worldwide and significant challenges with supply so prices go up
6533582 well demand continues to be strong and we continue to have some challenges on supply then pricing will remain strong
6533583 while the plan is well intentioned the answer to saving calves from long distance transport confinement in cruel tiny crates and slaughter soon after birth doesnt lie in encouraging consumers to eat more british meat
6533584 anyone who is concerned about the welfare of veal calves should dump dairy and go vegan
6533585 adults who follow a vegan diet on average weigh 10 to 20 lbs less than their meat eating and dairy guzzling counterparts
6533586 2004 marked the first time in the past six election years that more households watched coverage of the republican national convention than its democratic counterpart
6533587 it was always going to be an optimistic programme but we were confident we could achieve it this in no way reflects on the work undertaken by the technical team and our partners as it was due to circumstances beyond their control i also want to thank all our technical partners for their support during our intensive testing programme and especially for the supply of engines
6533588 we now have to concentrate on what we have ahead of us rather than behind we still have some great announcements to make in the near future we shall be able to announce our full race calendar as well as some deals that will enhance the overall package we are presenting to our fans for season four

6533595 we used to have a jewish neighbourhood which was one of the most authentic and historical streets in the city
6533596 the genocide was committed against civilians of south ossetia regardless of their ethnicity
6533597 he is quoted as saying that israeli arms sales to the georgian army should prompt the kremlin to strengthen the military alliance between russia and syria
6533598 i want to voice support for russia over the situation around abkhazia and south ossetia
6533599 we understand the essence of the russian position and consider its military reaction a response to provocation by the georgian side
6533600 syria was and is striving to develop strategic relations with russia in the interests of security in the whole world
6533601 one plan on the table in moscow debkafiles sources report is the establishment of big russian military naval and air bases in syria and the release of advanced weapons systems withheld until now to iran the s 300 air missile defense system and syria the nuclear capable 200 km range iskandar surface missile
6533602 we must freeze talks with syria until it stops calling on moscow to arm israels enemies and until damascus itself stops transferring arms to hizbullah
6533603 eight types of military vehicles explosives landmines and special explosives for the clearing minefields
6533604 georgian corporals and sergeants train with germans alpine units and the navy work with french instructors and special operations and urban warfare troops are taught by israelis
6533605 israels defense industries managed to sell to georgia drones automatic turrets for armored vehicles antiaircraft systems communication systems shells and rockets
6533606 israel has reportedly helped upgrade soviet designed su 25 ground attack jets assembled in georgia and former israeli generals serve as advisers to the georgian military
6533607 plans to establish a long term presence inside georgia and one of its breakaway republics
6533608 if implemented the plan would effectively put under russian control the border between georgia and south ossetia which is seeking independence as well as a small chunk of georgia proper
6533609 see whats in front of me completely uninfluenced by the clothing reputation hoopla conventional wisdom etc put on it by others
6533610 threaten ed the world with horrible poisons and diseases and gasses and atomic weapons
6533611 exploring ways of using these to target the united states
6533612 iraq probably would attempt clandestine attacks against the u s homeland if baghdad feared an attack that threatened the survival of the regime were imminent or unavoidable or possibly for revenge such attacks more likely with biological than chemical agents probably would be carried out by special forces or intelligence operatives

6533616 reflect the traditions of the chicago school and typify some of milton friedmans most interesting academic work including his advocacy for market alternatives to ill conceived policy initiatives
6533617 takes it as settled once and for all that the market is the only reasonable actor while states ngos and others just make a mess of things thats an ideologically committed narrow perpetuation of a right wing orthodoxy
6533618 when you think about the big battle between socialism and free markets
6533619 led the charge on behalf of the university of chicago there are a lot of people who will give back because of his name and effort and legacy
6533620 make the university of chicago a destination place for scholars across the spectrum
6533621 no intellectual enterprise at the university will ever be for sale
6533622 no that is not true we have not pulled out of the champions trophy but we have advised the icc about our considerable concern and we have made sure that they understand that we will not go anywhere which is not safe we are waiting to hear from them later this evening
6533623 ca at this stage hasnt made any official decision to not tour we are waiting to hear from icc the ball is in their court
6533624 we are very willing to tour pakistan we are very keen to do so and we will visit pakistan as long as the safety and security advisors say that it is safe
6533625 the only issue that is important for us is the safety and security of the players and the advice we get from our range of sources

6533639 for all practical purposes military to military cooperation had really already been suspended with the russians
6533640 nato canceled some exercises and i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6533641 they made a commitment to withdraw we expect them to withdraw
6533642 i would characterize it as others have which is that weve made good progress on it we are close
6533643 there are still some issues to work out but that its very premature at this point to say that we have an agreement secretary rice is there to work this issue specifically and a lot will be dependent on how well those discussions go
6533644 the conversations that were having with the iraqis now are based on the improvement in security and our mutual desire to bring more american troops home
6533645 i think the president and every american wants to see american troops come home but not until the job is done and there is more security more political progress and more economic progress inside iraq

6533658 if we are not willing to provide the troops necessary for victory however victory itself will be impossible
6533659 john recognized early on that more troops would be needed in order to achieve the security necessary for the iraqis to make the political progress were seeing now
6533660 he supported that action even though many said it would hurt his campaign for president he didnt care about popularity he cared about success for our troops and our country and now that the surge has worked it proves that johns judgment was correct

6533676 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who are indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
6533677 all this talk about creation of indian mujahideen needs to be probed i would not be surprised if such an organization has been floated by fundamentalist bodies like the rss rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or vhp vishwa hindu parishad with the sole intention of defaming muslims
6533678 i am not giving any clean chit to anyone but the manner adopted by the investigating agencies speaks of a blatant bias and a predetermined approach
6533679 an appropriate way to deal with the situation would be to constitute a high level committee comprising secular minded judicial luminaries like justice sachar justice krishna iyer and justice aa ahmadi it could even have representatives of hindu organizations like rss and vhp let them question the arrested young muslim boys and if the committee is convinced that they are actually involved in terrorism let them be hanged
6533680 okay so this really crummy thing happened but you will be okay you will still leave the birds cheese you will find a way to deal with this just take a sip of that wet drink in your hand and then go in and go to bed

6533764 when the fuck are you going to get it right
6533765 during the early part of 1998 while i was working on my business accounts in my cubicle mr
6533766 why in the goddamn hell are these boxes still sitting here and not mailed
6533767 and when are we going to get those things done
6533768 what the hell seems to be your problem whenever i tell you to get something done you cant seem to get it done
6533769 good intent or absence of discriminatory intent does not redeem employment procedures for testing mechanisms that operate as built in headwinds for minority groups that are unrelated to measuring job capacity
6533770 no employer having employees subject to the minimum wage provisions of the fair labor standards act shall discriminate with any establishment between employees on the basis of sex in such establishment for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill effort and responsibility and which are performed under similar working conditions
6533771 any woman over the age of fifty should be home in a rocking chair while element five would be challenging to establish i believe it could be done the most difficult problem arises under the third element that the employees did equal work while it is universally known and accepted that positions do not need to be identical they must at least require the same skill and responsibilities in the kaaren situation the entire staff of office workers were female while all the males worked in operations the responsibilities were different and so was the required skill furthermore even if kaaren were to establish a prima facie case claiming that she worked in operations hajoca has the defense of temporarily assigning employees to different divisions while paying them at the same rate 1 economic benefit employers may pay higher commissions to salesmen selling mens clothes because those sales generate more profit 2 market rate another common argument is that the wage difference is required to obtain the employees service this argument is difficult resulting in a split of authority the epa was not implemented to relieve individual consequences of their lack of value in the market place the other side of the argument is that the collective result of gender discrimination in employment gives men greater market value then women 3 remedying past discrimination there has been a split of authority when there is an increase in womens salaries to remedy past discrimination which results in the majority of women receiving more then men some courts have held that there is an absolute bar to discrepancy in pay even if it is intended to remedy past discrimination 21 conversely some courts have held that there is there is an absolute bar by fellow employees when the discrepancy in pay is to remedy past discrimination 4 shift differentials shift differential are a valid reason for pay differences 5 temporary reassignments the epa allows for employers too temporarily assign employees to other positions while paying them rate of their previous position instead of wages applicable to the current position being performed 6 temporary part time employees this is permissible 7 education and experience differences in pay is always permissible if it is due to differences in education or experience the difference is even allowable if the employers are doing equal workers as previously mentioned it is unlikely that kaaren could prevail under the flsa in the epa however kaaren may be able to pursue a similar claim under title viis equal pay act the title vii equal work for equal pay act is very similar to the equal pay act under the flsa but it does have a few key differences title vii applies when there is a discrepancy between the wages of two employees of opposite sex the difference between the equal pay act and title vii is that under the equal pay act the employees must be doing substantially the same job under title vii that barrier is removed the emphasis of title vii is to sex discrimination on the basis of compensation
6533772 it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for any employer to differentiate upon the basis of sex in determining the amount of the wages or compensation paid to employees if such differentiation is authorized by the epa
6533773 shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures the hiring the advancement or discharge of employees employee compensation job training and other terms conditions and privileges of employment
6533774 a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual
6533775 functions such as caring for oneself performing manual tasks walking seeing hearing speaking breathing learning and working
6533776 unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform ii significantly restricted as to the condition manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition manner or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform the same major life activity
6533777 1 nature and severity of the disability 2 the duration and 3 the permanent or long term impact of the impairment
6533778 the ada does not apply to the transient non permanent condition that the plaintiff experienced
6533779 if an individual is not substantially limited with respect to any other major life activity
6533780 the job from which the individual has been disqualified because of an impairment and the number and types of jobs utilizing similar training knowledge skill or abilities within that geographical area from which the individual is also disqualified because of the impairment
6533781 a person who satisfies the requisite skill experience education and other job related requirements of the employment such an individual holds or desires and who with or without reasonable accommodation can perform the essential functions of the employment position
6533782 a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities
6533783 might could or would be substantially limiting if mitigating measures were not taken
6533784 impose an undue hardship on the operations of the business
6533785 the impact of the accommodation upon the operation of the facility including the impact on the ability of other employees to perform their duties and the impact on the facilitys ability to conduct business
6533786 good intent or absence of discriminatory intent does not redeem employment procedures for testing mechanisms that operate as built in headwinds for minority groups that are unrelated to measuring job capacity
6533787 sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victims employment and create an abusive working environment
6533788 the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employees work performance
6533789 as far as i am concerned any woman over 50 should be home in a rocking chair

6533793 himalayan glaciers are retreating more rapidly than anywhere else in the world
6533794 the glaciers retreat is enormous up to 70 metres 230 feet per year
6533795 snow and glacial ice melting provide a very important source for fresh water for irrigation energy and drinking water downstream
6533796 the drier areas are becoming drier while the wetter areas are becoming wetter
6533797 in the past the rivers had a fairly constant flow throughout the summer due to melt water now you have a lot of rain in the spring and then you have fairly dry conditions throughout the rest of the summer
6533798 maybe before your district was suffering from one flash flood every season and that was perhaps what people managed to cope with but if you get three or four or five flash floods maybe thats too much the question is how much more can people tolerate without losing their basis for livelihood
6533799 this will transform the carbon sink into a carbon source more soil carbon will be released with the melting of glaciers and permafrost

6533829 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
6533830 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
6533831 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
6533832 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
6533833 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
6533834 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
6533835 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
6533836 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
6533837 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
6533838 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
6533839 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

6533842 if countries like australia pull out there is no question of the tournament going ahead with substitutes like bangladesh
6533843 obviously ess wants the best teams to participate and ensure a world class tournament
6533844 it is possible to ensure quality coverage if it is shifted to a nearby country even now but it will involve significant extra costs for the broadcaster
6533845 we are still fighting and are hopeful of hosting the tournament
6533846 the issue of security is subjective and what some may believe to be reality will be seen as mere perception by others
6533847 this is the issue that has to be resolved on sunday if the tournament has to go ahead
6533848 now think about that i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make five million dollars and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6533849 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their house you might have a different perspective
6533850 so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6533851 we cant afford eight more years or four more years or one more year of the same failed economic policies that president george bush has put in place
6533852 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6533853 he couldnt count high enough to know how many houses he owns
6533854 to put somebody in the white house who says i dont know much about the economy thats whats risky
6533855 does a guy who made more than four million dollars last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6533856 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6533857 im going to let the campaign speak for the campaign

6533891 non si capisce perch cittadini di pari reddito come milanesi e romani debbano avere trattamenti diversi per cui i primi pagano i pedaggi stradali mentre i secondi no

6533926 the reality is that football is a bulls world an insidious insipid egotistical greedy self motivated game and the problem is that nobody is going to change that
6533927 the ronaldo thing is about the fact he wants to go to spain
6533928 but im sorry little boy you signed a five year contract and youre going to do as youre told
6533929 he can sulk and pout and sit there with his earplugs in looking pretty for as long as he wants
6533930 but if hes not playing first team football for united hes going nowhere so hell pretty soon come in line get back in the team and will be doing as hes told
6533931 one thing that should change is the football establishments attitude towards footballers if sepp blatter said what he said then hes a bloody fool
6533932 agents are nasty scum theyre evil and divisive and pointless
6533933 they only survive because the rest of the sport is so corrupt and because leading football club people employ their sons in the job
6533934 in my opinion no owner in their right mind would willingly invite an average agent into his academy any more than a brothel owner would let a syphilitic nutter into his whorehouse
6533935 if an agent does a good job for me then i will pay him but i dont deal with players agents or agents employed by other clubs

6533944 once you have the volume mounted for the first time you can format it with any file system you want or if you have advanced applications such as high end database engines you could use it directly

6533946 snapshots also play an important role in building fault tolerance scenarios when combined with managing applications using elastic ip addresses and availability zones
6533947 one of the criticisms of ec2 when it first launched was the inability to run a fast data store across snapshots which made running databases or other data intensive applications slightly more complicated
6533948 the difference between ebs and s3 is that ebs allows block level access so that it can be mounted just like any other local storage device from within ec2 and can be accessed across servers and between instances

6533966 several of them went to prison but they were only in for a short time since they have money and political influence with which they are able to turn these cases into interminable legal disputes
6533967 a declared war on indigenous people by groups that have economic interests on their lands
6533968 the non indians arrived and invaded our land they started to hire us on their haciendas but when an indian would ask for his wages he would get a beating and would be thrown out
6533969 we were enslaved to buy a hammock we had to work for an entire month
6533970 amazonia is in brazil but the problem is a global one of concern to anyone who defends life
6533971 it doesnt only come from agribusiness but also from public works like roads hydroelectric plants or dikes
6533972 the last agricultural frontier on which agribusiness has its sights
6533973 we will see a major modification of the landscape here of water resources and the fauna and flora as a result of the rice plantations the agrotoxics used by the landowners are polluting the rivers and hurting the aquatic fauna
6533974 all the poison all the residues from the processing of rice are dumped into the rivers
6533975 indigenous lands will not survive unless there is an ecological and economic realignment of the country and of amazonia
6533976 brazil is the only country named after an almost extinct tree
6533977 as indigenous people we are going to defend nature because that is our conception of life that cosmogonic view of the world for the future of humanity
6533978 my understanding is that the program was approved by the nccu faculty senate
6533979 whatever the circumstances it was a grave oversight and i accept full responsibility for this mishap it was ultimately my responsibility to ensure that procedures were followed
6533980 i want to make it clear that there was no effort under way at the time to circumvent the approval process in keeping with best practices in academia i hope that the campus will find a way to help the students earn their degrees

6533984 were not just a bumbling bunch of preachers who cant talk and all were doing is baptizing babies
6533985 i deal with the white house i deal with tony blair i deal with presidents around the world
6533986 we saw a need in the community at that time and tried to fill it
6533987 what happened regarding this program is unfortunate because i have always tried to operate with integrity
6533988 i believe that through the strong leadership of nccu chancellor charlie nelms and unc system president erskine bowles they will do the right thing and find a way to ensure that these students are able to earn their degrees while protecting the integrity of the university of north carolina
6533989 when users mistype a domain name they are sometimes directed by their isps to a placeholder web site with generic advertisements
6533990 this is typically an additional revenue source for the isp in the case of china netcom customers of this prominent isp are directed to a web site under the control of an attacker
6533991 literally all microsoft users who havent updated to the latest patch are vulnerable to this
6533992 this is particularly dangerous in china because many users have pirated software or software that is not up to date
6533993 the online underworld is poised to launch targeted attacks in the coming weeks

6534009 snow and glacial ice melting provide a very important source for fresh water for irrigation energy and drinking water downstream
6534010 the drier areas are becoming drier while the wetter areas are becoming wetter
6534011 in the past the rivers had a fairly constant flow throughout the summer due to melt water now you have a lot of rain in the spring and then you have fairly dry conditions throughout the rest of the summer
6534012 maybe before your district was suffering from one flash flood every season and that was perhaps what people managed to cope with but if you get three or four or five flash floods maybe thats too much the question is how much more can people tolerate without losing their basis for livelihood

6534014 ive never seen anybody pay a real estate commission in the manner that you described it and i dont buy it im asking you to meet your commitments of openness by dispelling my suspicions of bribery and by allowing the public to see your 2002 tax returns and your brokers information showing where it went through your broker
6534015 was paid a reduced commission of 22 000 for that transaction you talk about a couple of months later i received a share of the calais buildings everything about me is an open book
6534016 its not my fault that she only has 20 000 to her name im a professional business manager i have a staff of more than a dozen i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
6534017 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market

6534023 when you consider that russia is a major exporter of oil outside of opec and is a major supplier of oil the threat of a supply disruption
6534024 the speculation is that we are drawing closer to the actual realization of any production being pulled offline in russia
6534025 the reason why gas supplies are so tight is because refineries are not making any demand is not there
6534026 we are going up for the same reasons we went to the highs concerns about the dollar the economy the feds ability to raise interest rates

6534060 a manned plane is sitting on a conveyor belt which has the ability to instantaneously match the speed of the plane but in the opposite direction when the plane throttles up will it be held in place or will it take off
6534061 and both are going at the airplanes takeoff speed but in opposite directions
6534062 held in place is in reference to the ground its really just simple english and sentence structure but you apparently dont get it this holds true with every version of the myth that has been presented here

6534076 these are not guys who typically see eye to eye and theyre all of the same mind
6534077 it seems to me theres a lot of unknowns here
6534078 id like to see the board to take action to get the legal staff to get whomever involved an opportunity to work through the things weve heard this morning and the board to go ahead and implement this jan 1 2010
6534079 board meetings are characterized by open and free wheeling discussions its not uncommon for board meetings afterward to have to go back and clarify what actions were taken
6534080 the agreement was staff was going to deal with implementation details and get back to the board but there was no question on the whether to have a surcharge and the only number i heard referred to was 25
6534081 my intention was the surcharge would be 25 based on the practice of other states
6534082 the bottom line is this is a crazy way for government to run
6534083 i like the ocean and the kids love it here and i love that
6534084 when i bought the first one my husband who is not a beach person said oh this is such a waste of money the kids will never go then it got to the point where they used it so much i couldnt get in the place so i bought another one
6534085 then it got to the point where they used it so much i couldnt get in the place so i bought another one
6534086 i was tasked by the atp board three years ago to create a vision that would involve bold changes for our sport i believe that has now been achieved

6534100 what we have accomplished in this agreement is the most advanced version of any
6534101 because the u s negotiators indeed showed a great deal of flexibility and understanding
6534102 we recognize that the government still has to review this agreement and well await that process and then it obviously has to go to the council of representatives
6534103 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6534104 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6534105 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6534106 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6534107 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6534108 the governments got a role to play but it is limited
6534109 a federal bailout of lenders would only encourage a recurrence of the problem
6534110 it is not the responsibility of the federal reserve nor would it be appropriate to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions but developments in financial markets can have broad economic effects felt by many outside the markets and the federal reserve must take those effects into account when determining policy
6534111 citigroup chief says worst of credit crunch crisis is over
6534112 to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions
6534113 to protect wall street and banking executives from the consequences of their financial decisions
6534114 would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country

6534133 were doing systematic observations now to determine if theres something that may trigger it but so far we havent found anything

6534138 seriously right amy is such a slut bag sandra was so into this guy she met at the bar but amy totally snatched him out of her hands i cant blame sandra but if she got to pick a fight at least fight about something other than manicure i dont understand why she couldnt just confront amy about her whoriness that night when amy wrapped herself around the bar dude like a koala on a eucalyptus tree or more like panda on a bamboo
6534139 thats because sandra didnt want to act like she cared she didnt want amy to know that her dirty little ho trick is getting to her
6534140 look bitch you are a meanie head and i do not wish our friendship to continue anymore because all you ever talk about are things that i dont care much for and you always say things to hurt people on top of that please dont walk next to me anymore because your purple eyeshadow embarrasses me

6534208 there was fire from machine guns on american planes that were guided by american special forces and we have no information that enables us to consider that the french soldiers were killed under fire from nato planes

6534382 from available statistics 100 000 infants die from sickle cell disease in nigeria annually making it the number one sickle cell endemic country in africa
6534383 based on world health organization who indices nigeria accounts for 75 percent of infant sickle cell cases in africa and almost 80 percent of infant deaths from the disease in the continent
6534384 this genetic disorder alone accounts for 8 percent of infant mortality in nigeria which calls for urgent attention
6534385 the mutant sickle cell gene confers a survival advantage against malaria which explains the prevalence of the disease in nigeria where malaria is endemic
6534386 this is why we advocate genetic counselling by intending couples before marriage to determine the status of their genes
6534387 people should go for a genetic test in the same way they determine their hiv status before marriage as the most effective way to protect their children and curtail the disease

6534450 the current round of protests kicked off with a march in chicago on friday so far its numbers have fallen well short of those seen in the first round on may 1 when protesters filled the streets of cities from california to new england
6534451 immigration protests that drew hundreds of thousands of flag waving demonstrators to the nations streets last spring promised a potent political legacy a surge of new hispanic voters
6534452 protest organizers principally unions hispanic advocacy groups and the catholic church acknowledge it has been hard to translate street activism into voting clout though they insist they can reach their goal of 1 million new voters by 2008
6534453 as i snapped a photo of one of the booths fronted with a spanish language sign advocating unconditional military defense of china cuba vietnam and north korea a white guy in a wide straw hat ran up to me wielding the workers vanguard newspaper published by the international communist league and trying to sell a subscription its unclear how much the marchers cared about freeing mumia abu jamal and theyremaking progress claimed the newspaper hawker or panning u n intervention in lebanon tucked inside the newspaper though was a flier advocating a fight for immigrants rights as well as breaking with the democratic party to build a revolutionary workers party and unite in class struggle against the capitalist rulers our aim is the achievement of new october revolutions nothing else nothing other nothing less reads the icl s website the answer coalition renowned for shoving itself into any event that remotely criticizes the bush administration provided slick signs and set up shop in front of a banner reading no borders in the workers struggle in spanish and english one white woman near the booth wore a kaffiyeh
6534454 no company should be above public scrutiny but much of the political criticism of wal mart is shallow and if followed undesirable wal mart doesnt pay high wages and benefits mainly because its in an industry retailing where those are rare in 2005 average hourly wages were 10 85 for food stores 10 63 for clothing stores and 10 84 for department stores as general motors and ford are now discovering companies that pay above market labor costs ultimately shrink and destroy jobs the efforts of some local governments notably the maryland legislature and chicago city council to mandate higher labor costs on wal mart are shortsighted

6534467 from all indications this falls midterm elections should confirm the judis teixeira thesis they could win back the house on nov 5 and are favored to win key governorships for the democrats happy days may be here again
6534468 when asked what would affect the future the british prime minister harold macmillan famously said events dear boy events the event this month that i think has done most to shape opinion was the arrest in london on aug 9 of 23 muslims suspected of plotting to blow up american airliners over the atlantic
6534469 theyve been trying to kill us for years going back at least to 1983 when a hezbollah suicide bomber killed 241 american servicemen in lebanon then they attacked the world trade center the u s embassies in kenya and tanzania and the uss cole in aden all while bill clinton was president sept 11 woke us up to the threat the political acrimony of 2004 and 2005 and this year made it seem remote the london arrests reminded us its still there

6534473 as steve sailer pointed out in the american conservative george bush carried the 19 states with the highest white fertility rates and 25 of the top 26 john kerry won the 16 states with the lowest rates
6534474 democrats swept the largely childless cities true blue locales like san francisco portland seattle boston and manhattan have the lowest percentages of children in the nation but generally had poor showings in those places where families are settling down notably the sun belt cities exurbs and outer suburbs of older metropolitan areas
6534475 simply put liberals have a big baby problem theyre not having enough of them they havent for a long time and their pool of potential new voters is suffering as a result
6534476 the fertility gap doesnt budge when we correct for factors like age income education sex race or even religion indeed if a conservative and a liberal are identical in all these ways the liberal will still be 19 percentage points more likely to be childless than the conservative some believe the gap reflects an authentic cultural difference between left and right in america today
6534477 first america should lift the economic embargo that president john f kennedy imposed in 1962
6534478 second washington should transform cuba into a giant free trade zone
6534479 third as part of this economic aperture the u s should terminate the absurd and destructive federal sugar program
6534480 finally uncle sam should smile upon greater travel to and from cuba by both americans and cubans
6534481 on thursday jacques chirac confirmed a le monde report that his government was prepared to offer only some 200 combat engineers in addition to the 200 french troops already in lebanon to what is supposed to be the resolutions centerpiece a 15 000 man u n force that will help the lebanese army patrol their southern border and ensure that hezbollah will no longer use the area as a staging ground for future attacks against israel given that the french contingent was supposed to be at the vanguard of this enhanced force its unclear whether other nations will be willing to chip in with troops of their own all of this after the french used the promise of a robust french led international force to get the u s and israel to agree to a cease fire and withdrawal even less reassuring is the insistence by french defense minister michele alliot marie that her troops will remain in the lead only until february after which apparently its salaam and adieu
6534482 and i would like to express my deep concern that the french apparently are not going to inject the number of troops that would be necessary to lead this 15 000 person peacekeeping force so far theyre saying they would only about 200 its very disappointing
6534483 civilization simply lacks backbone without the united states in the lead
6534484 this inability of europe to get its act together is what suggests 1938 back then churchill was hardly the only one who thought hitler was intent on war after all the german leader was an ideological zealot and a murderer to boot
6534485 ms arellano willfully violated u s immigration laws and is now facing the consequences of her actions by failing to report to immigration authorities
6534486 we will arrest and deport her as required by law at an appropriate time and place arellano illegally crossed into the united states in 1997 and was deported shortly afterward she returned within days living for three years in oregon before moving to chicago in 2000 arrested two years later at ohare airport where she was working as a cleaning woman she was convicted of working under a false social security number and ordered to appear at the immigration office in chicago
6534487 the illegitimacy rate among hispanics is high and rising faster than that of other ethnic groups their dropout rate is the highest in the country hispanic children are joining gangs at younger and younger ages academic achievement is abysmal
6534488 while i wholeheartedly agree with the general result the courts opinion and reasoning are weak in a variety of ways and given the magnitude of the opinion and the efforts that will be made to undermine it i fear that judge diggs taylor has in the long run undermined those of us who have believed the nsa program is illegal since its existence was revealed several months ago
6534489 the opinion is almost devoid of analysis on the key constitutional provisions it relies upon the court more or less ducks the issue of whether the intercept program is consistent with fisa and completely dodges the issue of whether the president has the inherent power to authorize the intercepts it reasons that the constitution trumps the statute page 39 and that the president lacks the inherent power to violate specific constitutional provisions pages 40 41 it is part of my job as a litigator and has been for more than 30 years to read and understand judicial opinions off hand i cannot recall reading an opinion as conclusory and content free as the key portions of this opinion
6534490 anyone who knows what legal analysis and legal argument look like anyone who knows the requisites of legal reasoning must look on the of judge anna diggs taylor in the nsa case in amazement it is a pathetic piece of work if it had been submitted by a student in my second year legal writing class at the university of st thomas law school it would have earned a failing grade
6534491 discomfort with the quality of the decision is almost universal said howard j bashman a pennsylvania lawyer whose web log provides comprehensive and nonpartisan reports on legal developments
6534492 this reasoning is ludicrous americans have no reasonable expectation of privacy when seeking to communicate with persons outside the united states u s privacy law consequently does not cannot apply moreover virtually every intelligence agency in the world is pursuing al qaeda operatives and intercepting their communications in judge taylors perfect world only the u s the primary target of al qaeda would be forbidden to do so
6534493 much will be said about this opinion in the coming days ill start with this i wouldnt accept this utterly unsupported constitutionally and logically bankrupt collection of musings from a first year law student much less a new lawyer at my firm
6534494 unlike judge taylor presidents are accountable to the voters for their war making decisions as the current white house occupant has discovered judge taylor can write her opinion and pose for the cameras and no one can hold her accountable for any americans who might die as a result
6534495 the starting point of course is the constitution article ii of the constitution sets out the powers and duties of the president
6534496 article ii makes the president commander in chief of the armed forces
6534497 if our soldiers or intelligence agencies discover a terrorist in afghanistan iraq or elsewhere the president or his designees can order an air strike or other attack to kill him it would be very odd if the president has the authority to kill a terrorist but not to intercept his telephone calls or search his cave
6534498 one of the serious weaknesses of our federal judicial system is that in many cases plaintiffs can forum shop for a favorable district or judge
6534499 it is quite clear that the government will appeal this opinion and because the courts opinion quite frankly has so many holes in it it is also clear to me that the plaintiffs will have to relitigate the entire matter before the circuit court and possibly the supreme court
6534500 the foiling of the plot in britain was a kind of public policy miracle a rare chance to rethink the u s could have spent the past week with 4 000 funerals we would have had calls for measures so stringent and draconian they would make the bush program look like pattycake we have none of that but unless our politics changes we will
6534501 unfortunately the decision yesterday by a federal district court in detroit striking down the nsas program is neither careful nor scholarly and it is hard hitting only in the sense that a bludgeon is hard hitting the angry rhetoric of u s district judge anna diggs taylor will no doubt grab headlines but as a piece of judicial work that is as a guide to what the law requires and how it either restrains or permits the nsas program her opinion will not be helpful
6534502 the antiwar left has a conveniently flexible moral compass consequently the clinton era echelon program was fine but bushs nsa terrorist surveillance program is an impeachable offense
6534503 the statistics on immigrants and crime are shocking but not for the reasons buchanan et al would have you believe
6534504 illegal immigrants got more than 22 4 million worth of non emergency medical care at parkland memorial hospital this year officials said tuesday the cost estimate was the first time parkland has quantified how much dallas county taxpayers are paying for such care for illegal immigrants
6534505 several dozen residents crowded into the council chambers to discuss whether the city should restrict illegal immigrants through such measures as making it illegal for landlords to lease property to them fining businesses that employ them making english the citys official language and halting funding for children of illegal immigrants to participate in summer funshine and other youth programs
6534506 in a letter in the local newspaper this month john kimmel who runs the detox bar and grill said he would create an
6534507 los secuestradores no se hacen en la calle se forman en las familias lo cual es un claro signo de que la descomposici n social en m xico ha llegado a niveles nunca antes vistos
6534508 la inseguridad es un problema estructural y multifactorial que se viene gestando desde hace muchas d cadas porque incluso actualmente existen bandas de secuestradores conformadas por familias enteras lo que habla de una descomposici n brutal del tejido social
6534509 cifra negra de ndices delictivos lo cual significa que la cifra oficial que se conoce no es la exacta
6534510 en realidad la cifra oficial siempre es mucho menor por varios factores uno de ellos porque mucha gente tiene miedo a denunciar y no lo hace
6534511 en honor a la verdad siempre se esconden cifras oficiales tanto en desastres como en delincuencia
6534512 plamegate is turning out to be as some have long suspected exactly the opposite of what weve been led to believe it was not a revenge inspired hit job by the bush administration but an example of d c s insider culture at its worst a public partisan and dubious attack launched in the op ed pages of the countrys biggest newspaper followed by innocent gossip between a reporter and a high level official and the subsequent shameful silence of that official influenced by interdepartment fears and rivalries followed by a firestorm of media speculation and innuendo followed by an investigation followed by an indictment for obstruction of justice over a crime that was never committed followed by revelations that the whole thing wasnt what it was portrayed to be by critics of the administration and the media
6534513 guess how many jelly beans are in the jar and win the car
6534514 if the 2006 midterm election were held today tomorrow or even next week it would be safe to say that republicans would hold on barely but with just enough room to spare to their majorities in both the house and senate they retain all the advantages of incumbency fundraising and redistricting and the democrats would still need a net gain of at least 15 seats to take over the house and a net of six to retake the senate
6534515 if the mid term elections were held today republicans would narrowly retain control of the u s senate according to rasmussen reports polling data our summary shows the gop is favored in enough races to hang on to 50 senate seats at the moment forty seven seats would be in democratic hands while 3 are in the toss up category
6534516 the democratic partys single biggest foreign policy liability is not that americans think democrats are soft it is that americans think democrats stand for nothing that they have no principles beyond political expedience and given the partys behavior over the past several months it is not hard to understand why
6534517 during the first phase of this war going back certainly to the 1970s we were essentially passive we were hit by increasing numbers of terrorist acts but though there was a gradual buildup of concern we did nothing significant in response to these attacks then september 11 woke america up we reacted powerfully putting in place a different philosophy and taking a great variety of actions to implement that philosophy
6534518 this year the new report says the deficit will be 260 billion or 111 billion less than the cbo estimated in march for 2006 the government deficit will be 2 percent of gross domestic product down from the old baseline prediction for 2006 of 2 6 percent
6534519 the u s deficit is worth comparing for starters with the data for european nations in the maastricht treaty of 1992 european leaders set a deficit goal of 3 percent of gdp eu member countries have had trouble meeting that target since a shortfall of 2 percent of gdp is also news in the u s context sure there was the surplus in the second half of the 1990s but 2 percent is below the average for the federal deficit between 1980 and 1995
6534520 the 2 percent figure stands out when you compare it with the deficit level in other periods of war in 1944 as the u s poured its energy into winning world war ii the federal deficit widened to 22 7 percent of gdp in 1968 the year of the tet offensive in the vietnam war the deficit was 2 9 percent of gdp much of the narrowing of the deficit in the 1990s and even the surplus of the late 1990s came because of reductions in military spending following the end of the cold war this was the short lived peace dividend the late 1990s boom also played a role it brought in hundreds of billions more than forecast
6534521 this isnt the moment for a politics based on comics turning the president and vice president into joke material
6534522 lord if only i could have talked with hitler all this might have been avoided this naivete in the service of endless accommodationism recalls also the flaccid foreign policy of the post vietnam democratic left it lost the day it lost the country to ronald reagan and a muscular foreign policy that in the end won the cold war

6534525 jug con salcido que lo conoce bien con rafael m rquez y dem s as que pese a que no juega en europa se mostr como todo un europeo eriksson hizo lo recomendable en este caso creo que el sistema que emple los jugadores que puso al servicio de ese sistema era lo ideal que se necesitaba para que ese sistema diera frutos ya que todos los jugadores europeos juegan bajo ese sistema
6534526 estamos hablando de rafael m rquez ricardo osorio carlos salcido andr s guardado de hecho el mismo fernando arce porque aunque juega en santos est jugando con dos l neas de cuatro entonces creo que emple a los jugadores adecuados para el sistema que ten a preparado
6534527 es normal por el entendimiento a un sistema de juego se vio un equipo con personalidad ya estamos viendo jugadores con un nivel importante creo que con el tiempo la selecci n con ese tipo de jugadores ser muy fuerte

6534531 ra l was always under the influence of alcohol and self importance ra l is generally perceived as a colorless minister of defense but he has also been the brutal head of one of communisms most criminal institutions the cuban political police i met him in that capacity he was cruel and ruthless fidel may have conceived the terror that has kept cuba in the communist fold but ra l has been the butcher he has been instrumental in the killing and terrorizing of thousands of cubans and there is no question in my mind but that he would fight tooth and nail to preserve his powers otherwise sooner or later ra l would have to account for his crimes and i do not know him to be suicidal in 2005 fidel was furious when forbes magazine estimated his fortune at 500 million particularly in view of cubas penury this amount is surely more than enough for ra l to bribe his political cronies and buy any new allies he needs i pray that others who know ra l as well as i knew ceausescu will come forward and disrobe the cuban tyrant allowing the world to see him naked the way he truly is an assassin and international terrorist who made a fortune from the illegal sale of arms drugs and human beings
6534532 in the first general election poll since ned lamont defeated lieberman in tuesdays primary the incumbent is hanging on to a five percentage point lead
6534533 what we are looking at here is cognitive dissonance the mindset of the left blogosphere is that theres no real terrorist threat out there we wouldnt have any serious problem if wed just do something different raise the minimum wage or reduce the number without health insurance the first issue lamont mentioned on election night withdraw from iraq or as some left bloggers suggest sell out israel
6534534 the white house commission on aviation safety and security led by vice president al gore issues its final report which highlights the risk of terrorist attacks in the us the report references operation bojinka the failed plot to bomb twelve american airliners out of the sky over the pacific ocean and calls for increased aviation security the commission reports that it believes that terrorist attacks on civil aviation are directed at the united states and that there should be an ongoing federal commitment to reducing the threats that they pose

6534665 its a tricky situation because if the mdc fails to take up its seats in parliament two things could happen after a certain number of days absent from parliament the elected officials could lose their seat and consequently that seat could then go to a bye election and given the current climate in zimbabwe that could be quite a dangerous thing for the mdc
6534666 they will not be in a position to elect the speaker and deputy speaker of parliament and these are very important positions they could lose that opportunity to zanu pf party
6534667 yes the mdc says if parliament is convened it is a violation of the memorandum of understanding which was the document that set the agenda for talks and in that document the parties agreed that parliament would not be reconvened without consensus however it may come down to deciding what is the best option on the day because the talks have not reached an agreement yet regarding a possible government of national unity and the leaders in southern africa are very keen that this agreement be reached as soon as possible but there are disagreements about what powers will be held by the various parties and particularly the party leaders in such a cabinet

6534709 himalayan glaciers are retreating more rapidly than anywhere else in the world
6534710 the glaciers retreat is enormous up to 70 metres 230 feet per year
6534711 snow and glacial ice melting provide a very important source for downstream
6534712 the drier areas are becoming drier while the wetter areas are becoming wetter
6534713 in the past the rivers had a fairly constant flow throughout the summer due to melt water now you have a lot of rain in the spring and then you have fairly dry conditions throughout the rest of the summer
6534714 maybe before your district was suffering from one every season and that was perhaps what people managed to cope with but if you get three or four or five flash floods maybe thats too much the question is how much more can people tolerate without losing their basis for livelihood

6534724 they believe it can steal time can affect consumer behavior and can influence how autonomous children are
6534725 based on the interviews the surveys and the time use diaries it appears that those who do not watch television not only reject television in order to keep sex violence shallow news coverage and consumerism out of their lives but also to encourage family interaction their childrens independence and creativity and a wise use of their time
6534726 i was surprised to find that two large groups of non viewers were exceedingly different in many ways but shared commonalities regarding television

6534728 by researching families without television i think we learn a lot about the role of television in the lives of american families

6534735 you touched on the idea that someones history may be truth like where you went to school but what if this is a matrix world and nmsu doesnt exist where does that leave your truth
6534736 he came up to me and said you know the funny thing is i think we both want the same thing
6534737 we kind of agreed to disagree but obviously you look at the life he led and all the things he accomplished its pretty amazing and he certainly leaves a legacy he certainly made an impact in a lot of ways in the nfl

6534750 they are here to stay they are part of our energy solutions
6534751 if were going to cut our dependence on foreign suppliers we must be committed to building this new energy portfolio
6534752 if we do that it would double the farm income in this country
6534753 this level of production should ease some of the pressure on retail prices and cool down that debate about whether were making the right choice about food versus fuel with our corps
6534754 the reason we get 70 percent of the energy from outside the united states is because americans and some of its leaders got complacent
6534755 our official position is that the way its working now works ok
6534756 unofficially if congress decides to move it into one agency or the other i hope they put it in usda

6534767 the role of the media in promoting and reducing tobacco use
6534768 the tobacco industry tried for five years to shut down our successful truth youth smoking prevention campaign
6534769 ninety percent of adult smokers began before the age of 20 so cultivating new smokers is critical to big tobaccos business model to replace the more than 400 000 adults who die from tobacco annually with new smokers keeping young people from starting to smoke is a critical part of the equation if we want to make major strides toward saving lives bold effective counter marketing campaigns that reduce smoking rates and change social norms are proven effective in doing just that
6534770 this report sends a loud and clear message to policy makers we need less tobacco company marketing and more anti tobacco advertising
6534771 it shows why we need strong regulation of tobacco products and their marketing to prevent tobacco companies from continuing to target our children it also should prompt states to fully fund tobacco prevention and cessation campaigns that are proven to work and it should spur governments worldwide to implement the international tobacco control treaty which calls on governments to ban all tobacco advertising promotion and sponsorship and fund effective public education campaigns

6534776 kalau dalam waktu 24 jam ada 50 orang berdoa buat kesembuhanmu maka kau akan hidup dan sebaliknya jika dalam 24 jam jumlah yang aku tetapkan belum terpenuhi itu artinya kau akan meninggal dunia

6534778 anakku aku sudah berkeliling mencari suara hati yang berdoa buatmu tapi sampai saat ini baru 3 orang yang berdoa buatmu sementara waktumu tinggal 60 menit lagi rasanya mustahil kalau dalam waktu dekat ini ada 50 orang yang berdoa buat kesembuhanmu
6534779 aku akan memberitahukanmu kenapa tuhan rindu memberikanmu kesempatan kedua itu karena doa istrimu yang tidak putus putus berharap akan kesembuhanmu
6534780 tuhan aku tahu kalau selama hidupnya suamiku bukanlah suami atau ayah yang baik aku tahu dia sudah mengkhianati pernikahan kami aku tahu dia tidak jujur dalam bisnisnya dan kalaupun dia memberikan sumbangan itu hanya untuk popularitas saja untuk menutupi perbuatannya yang tidak benar dihadapanmu tapi tuhan tolong pandang anak anak yang telah engkau titipkan pada kami mereka masih membutuhkan seorang ayah hamba tidak mampu membesarkan mereka seorang diri
6534781 ada beberapa yang berdoa buatmu tapi mereka tidak tulus bahkan ada yang mensyukuri penyakit yang kau derita saat ini itu semua karena selama ini kamu arogan egois dan bukanlah atasan yang baik bahkan kau tega memecat karyawan yang tidak bersalah
6534782 benar anakku kau pernah memberi bantuan bagi mereka beberapa bulan yang lalu walau aku tahu tujuanmu saat itu hanya untuk mencari popularitas saja dan untuk menarik perhatian pemerintah dan investor luar negeri

6534836 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6534837 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6534838 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6534839 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6534840 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6534841 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6534842 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6534843 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6534844 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6534845 i cant imagine a world without genes larger than life presence
6534846 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6534847 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6534848 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6534849 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6534850 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union
6534851 he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players playing alongside of gene was an honor and a privilege he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams

6534860 i constantly marvel at how bill iwocpo and his disciples at abel to yzerman can be so pompous and full of themselves throughout every regular season but come playoff time they collapse into wavering puddles of stress and nervousness as they anxiously await the impending and unavoidable collapse of the red wings in the post season
6534861 its just a shame that the most classless uneducated lowbrow fanbase in the league gets this sweep red wing fans dont deserve their team

6534881 we also have been working with some of their key software providers to port some of the applications that they have internally natively onto force com for them to use
6534882 and all of that together suddenly we were one of their key technology vendors and it really gave them the ability to sign what we call an enterprise license agreement with us
6534883 having a big hitter commit to developing on force com is really important
6534884 previously those committing have tended to be saas smb players like centive or xactly or midmarket on premise apps vendors looking to get saasy quickly like coda
6534885 talked proudly about not needing to rely on a third party vendors erp but creating its own apps
6534886 so i wonder if that might be a possibility as well as the ability to tailor salesforce crm more to the needs of its sales reps
6534887 you are going to see us offering our customers natively google app engine and other cloud computing paradigms directly from our application programming interfaces
6534888 you see it already where some of our isvs independent software vendors build the majority of their application in force com but maybe will reach out to amazon reach out to google app engine or others were going to collapse that access into our api to make it as easy as possible for them

6534961 creo que importantes decisiones sobre nuestra cooperaci n con la otan se tomar n durante esas consultas
6534962 rusia no necesita m s a la otan de lo que la ella nos necesita a nosotros la ayuda de rusia es crucial para la otan en afganist n donde se juega su futuro
6534963 todo depende de las prioridades de la otan si la prioridad es el apoyo al deca do r gimen de saakashvili presidente de georgia en perjuicio de la asociaci n con rusia no es culpa nuestra
6534964 intentar convertir al agresor en v ctima justificar al r gimen criminal salvar a un r gimen que se hunde y apostar por el rearme

6534966 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into transatlantic structures
6534967 today we have received an encouraging signal from mechel and other companies engaged in the sale of coking coal that they are voluntary ready to cut their prices by 15 percent
6534968 we intend to complete the probe into the activities of evraz holding and raspadsky coal in the next two weeks
6534969 capital inflow will be slightly below the official forecast due to the persisting global financial crisis and certain political risks that have emerged recently and influenced foreign investors behavior
6534970 the bonds in which we have invested have not incurred losses but instead have made us more than a billion dollars in the last six months
6534971 wiretap those suspected of cartel conspiracy and simplify the process of collecting proof of guilt
6534972 it is not enough to show the judge that 10 companies had raised their prices simultaneously he needs evidence of conspiracy clearly it would have to be the tapes of phone negotiations since nobody signs any papers to this regard
6534973 all of this is manual management while we need to create a system that would regulate the market based on the existing legislation fairly and rationally
6534974 we have to think about improving the legislation and eliminating the loopholes that it has
6534975 it has not been addressed well by the candidate and it has not been handled honestly by pundits until it is it lurks as a torpedo that could spell the doom of his promising candidacy
6534976 there are a number of beliefs in mormonism which directly contradict mainstream christianity and which challenge objective history the question is how many people will learn of these things and run in the direction of other candidates
6534977 if an entire society existed in north america for centuries before and after the birth of christ planting crops worshiping in a judeo christian fashion using an egyptian hebrew hybrid language riding chariots and smelting iron wouldnt there be archeological evidence of it
6534978 i really dont think its productive for me to say let me tell you about this doctrine or that doctrine
6534979 do you believe that the earth is 5 000 years old and that the biblical account of the creation is accurate what evidence can you point to
6534980 do you believe that god is three people the father the son and the holy ghost

6534982 the democratic congressional campaign committee has a 10 1 cash advantage over its republican adversary and the democratic senatorial campaign committee has a cash advantage that is three times greater than the national republican senatorial committees take in addition the loss of control of congress has stripped republicans of one of their most lucrative fund raising assets committee chairmanships according to a center for inquiry study released last week corporate donors have made a seismic shift since january toward the new democratic chairmen in the first six months of this year political action committees donated 41 million to democrats compared with 24 million for republicans during the previous year republicans received 32 million in pac contributions compared with 22 million for the democrats the report concluded in the presidential field the democrats two top candidates sens barack obama ill and hillary rodham clinton n y each have nearly as much money in the bank as the combined savings of the entire 2008 republican field the 10 republicans running for president reported a combined total of 36 million cash on hand obama has 35 million and clinton has 33 million available for the primary race
6534983 either people know beforehand that the thing is a fake or they are satisfied with the quality of goods they purchase
6534984 as the majority of counterfeit goods are imported these measures are quite effective
6534985 at present the government seems to be taking a piecemeal approach what they need is more comprehensive action i believe the government should appoint an agency specifically responsible for crimes against intellectual property at the moment this area is covered by several agencies which is much less effective than a single agency would be
6534986 on the whole the current laws are quite effective but there also need to be economic measures to tackle the problem such as teaching customers to detect fake goods and to protect their rights as well as a reduction in prices on genuine goods
6534987 the russian yacht market has increased by 50 70 percent every year for the last three years
6534988 certainly such duties essentially reduce the opportunity for russians to buy boats especially yachts
6534989 a yacht still remains a status symbol frankly speaking a competition between yacht owners over who has the best yacht really exists
6534990 in russia this type of event was held for the first time it wasnt flawless but it was a pretty good beginning
6534991 they organize different meetings and discussions with their partners or sign treaties on board the yacht rather than in the office i personally think its a good idea
6534992 however with the popularization and development of yachtings infrastructure it has attracted wider layers of the population
6534993 how much would a dollar or two help in reaching the goal

6535004 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
6535005 for this small colony of snails to remain undiscovered for more than 100 years despite thousands of people visiting cliveden every year is remarkable
6535006 it really is a case of hidden nature revealing itself to the world after remaining in splendid isolation for so long and demonstrates how important our built structures can be for wildlife discoveries like this are rare and its a chance for us to celebrate the amazing nature of wildlife
6535007 although the cliveden snail hitched a ride to the uk accidentally it doesnt appear to be a threat to our native wildlife as it has taken one hundred years to get from the balustrade to the house so were now working to ensure that it has a secure future at cliveden
6535008 you get to a point where you dont care theres a lack of hope the future is bleak
6535009 if you teach people who are impoverished how to get out of poverty that gives them hope and that breaks the cycle of impoverishment

6535041 we still left a lot of opportunities on the field i still want to see more in our team possession and our defending as a team we had a lot of room for improvement in those areas we addressed that over the last couple of days and i think it will be much improved

6535057 as far as nato and isaf natos international security assistance force isaf are concerned the allegations in le monde are completely unfounded
6535058 we deny the report we have no information whatsoever that would indicate that the french soldiers were killed by nato planes
6535059 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or wounded were consistent with air delivered ordnance
6535060 we know that the planes supplying what we call close air support could not engage because the french troops were very close to the taliban insurgents
6535061 if they had engaged there might have been considerable collateral damage if bombs had been used
6535062 no french soldier at any time during the incident came on the radio to say that they were taking friendly fire and no french soldier after the event has mentioned to the chain of command that this might have been the case
6535063 there was fire from machine guns on american planes that were guided by american special forces and we have no information that enables us to consider that the french soldiers were killed under fire from nato planes
6535064 fifteen to 20 minutes after the engagement of our forces a support section left the base camp and took around 40 to 50 minutes to get to the scene
6535065 as far as nato and isaf nato amp squo s international security assistance force isaf are concerned the allegations in le monde are completely unfounded
6535066 we deny the report we have no information whatsoever that would indicate that the french soldiers were killed by nato planes

6535071 people inquire about our position on those who consider themselves so called gay and lesbians we love them as sons and daughters of god they may have certain inclinations which are powerful and which may be very difficult to control if they do not act on these inclinations then they can go forward as do all other members of the church if they violate the law of chastity and the moral standards of the church then they are subject to the discipline of the church just as others are
6535072 you know i remember the month of august very well when my two daughters were in college because that meant a big payment we had to make writing those checks to help them pay their tutition pay their room and board get those books purchased
6535073 i dont think students are leaving because of college tax credits paying tuition theyre leaving because theres no opportunity here they go where theres opportunity they go where theres an exciting cultural life and thats what we need to address
6535074 there is a firewall between management and our news room

6535076 my expectation is we will have to fill it from within even though our reporters are as thin as they have ever been we do have a handful of people from which we can select anyone of whom could take over the anchor position
6535077 i love what ive been doing and im reluctant to give it up i dont think i could wear three hats
6535078 i love going out into the world every day the anchor sits indoors much of the day and is desk bound for me it is more gratifying to be reporting

6535080 this kind of testing has many applications but certainly political polling at election time would be one it cant give answers to all questions but it could certainly help pollsters to get more information than people now share
6535081 the sight of a feather in a peacocks tail whenever i gaze at it makes me sick
6535082 how can this trait be made in one gender and not the other
6535083 males and females basically have the same set of genes so how do you specifically modify the activity of a males genes but not a females genes
6535084 the flies did not need new genes to make a new pattern
6535085 they just changed how males and females use a common set of genes
6535086 the switch existed for tens of millions of years because it had a different job
6535087 but it got remodeled evolution is a cumulative process you have this machinery and its easy to add a bell or a whistle with this particular trait it evolved by exploiting genetic information that was already there to make male bodies different from female bodies
6535088 we have enough evidence to believe this evolved in a male specific way
6535089 if female tastes change these traits go away there is no reinforcement
6535090 if the dot makes any attempt to amend the uasl or even proposes a new 3g licence it is obliged by law to seek our recommendations
6535091 the uas licensees are authorized to provide triple play services 3g service providers are not new category of licensees and they shall be offering 3g services under terms amp conditions of uasl this will include 3g spectrum allocation so section 11 of the trai act is not applicable in this situation
6535092 there is also a need to clearly specify licence fee charges without spectrum the authority is of the view that the licence fee charges should be on a reduced scale to facilitate penetration of telecom services
6535093 this is the best time for the government to take lead to revive the primary market

6535096 it is hereby agreed and decided to refund excess premium to insured persons above 60 years who have renewed their policies between august 16 2007 and april 9 2008

6535107 i think its a great means to get to people particularly young people
6535108 i think its important to use the means thats out there this is whats popular now this is whats effective now
6535109 i think its a fun medium and a way to reach a lot of people at a reasonable price

6535120 this is something ive always done for kicks it accidentally became my job my posters are just loud eye candy theyre designed to look cool get attention and create a buzz for a rock n roll show im really more of an entertainer
6535121 i would like to extend my deepest condolences to the family and friends of gene upshaw he was a giant in the nfl since entering the league in 1967 first as a hall of fame offensive lineman then as an active member of the collective bargaining process in the late 1970s and early 1980s and finally as the executive director of the nflpa gene continually served in the best interests of the game of football he played a colossal role in the success the nfl enjoys today even more than many people realize
6535122 with genes passing the nfl has lost an innovator players have lost their advocate and i have lost a friend a hall of fame player gene was also a hall of fame businessman and negotiator he always had the best interests of the nfl players at heart and that played a large role in building our league to the prominence it enjoys today my prayers and the prayers of the washington redskins organization go out to his family at this sad time
6535123 on behalf of the philadelphia eagles i am very saddened and shocked to learn of gene upshaws passing this morning whether it was as a hall of fame offensive lineman with the oakland raiders or as executive director of the nfl players association gene was a tremendous leader and a wonderful person gene always believed the best way to build the popularity of our sport was to craft a dynamic partnership between the players and the owners that served the best interest of the fans we as well as the entire nfl family will miss his presence dearly and our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife terri and their three sons
6535124 from where the union started to where it is today is leaps and bounds a lot of that credit has to go with gene and what he stood for he stood his ground on a lot of key issues with the backing of the players he was able to get us in a pretty good position in terms of health benefits with the presidents at the time be it troy vincent and trace armstrong they worked to get us in a very good position and hes left us in a very good position
6535125 a tremendous shock i dont know the situation of when he was diagnosed i dont know any of that information to have someone of genes age and the way he carried himself to all of a sudden receive a phone call that gene has passed away was a huge shock to me thats why i always live my life in a certain way and thats to make sure my house is in order because you never know when that time is coming
6535126 this is a loss for the entire nfl gene was the epitome of what the nfl stands for

6535333 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
6535334 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
6535335 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
6535336 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
6535337 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
6535338 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
6535339 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
6535340 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
6535341 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
6535342 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
6535343 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
6535344 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
6535345 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
6535346 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
6535347 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
6535348 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
6535349 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
6535350 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
6535351 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
6535352 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
6535353 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
6535354 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
6535355 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
6535356 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
6535357 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
6535358 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
6535359 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
6535360 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
6535361 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
6535362 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
6535363 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
6535364 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
6535365 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
6535366 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
6535367 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
6535368 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
6535369 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
6535370 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
6535371 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
6535372 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
6535373 try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value

6535414 it does not take a majority to prevail but rather an
6535415 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6535416 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6535417 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6535418 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6535419 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6535420 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6535428 we hope the very difficult and delicate task of identification can be done with the utmost efficiency
6535429 tony and i both laughed at that we got a chuckle out of it
6535430 we arrived three minutes late and they let us check in but we did not make it we ended up trying to find a new flight then we discovered the plane we would have been on had crashed
6535431 we had no idea what had happened my mouth dropped open
6535432 we have to fly to the canary islands were from there and that about sums it up

6535434 four attacks in two days ships being hijacked and crews being taken and large ransoms being demanded is completely unacceptable
6535435 this is the worst number of attacks that we have seen in a short period of time for years
6535436 give piracy a much higher priority to bring this under control there have been seven vessels hijacked since the 20th of july
6535437 they have some of their vessels which are tracking some of these hijacked ships but the problem is its very difficult to take action once the hijackers are on board

6535442 they were a combat engineer reconnaissance team and they were at that point in time conducting a routine reconnaissance
6535443 they were on their way to the site where they were going to do the reconnaissance of a route thats going to be used for a future operation
6535444 youre full of it i saw you walk up to the door just now
6535445 have you ever considered getting the hell out of my way before i break that jaw of yours
6535446 how do you know you have to go more than me
6535447 theres probably a potted plant out back you could use
6535448 well since you thought of that wonderful potted plant idea you should get to run with it
6535449 then shut up and let me go take a leak
6535450 i dont know did someone else just go in there
6535451 its not about being taught fixed positions postures in which to hold the body and it isnt manipulation like say physiotherapy or massage
6535452 the goal of at is to set up the right circumstances under which the body can function as it was meant to
6535453 youre learning the tools you need to use your body more effectively and efficiently and getting to know your patterns and habits so you can let go of the bad ones the hands on element is important because it helps you feel how a movement can be different thats difficult to do from a book
6535454 definitely by the time people walk through the door they are usually willing to change something
6535455 theyve been through the my backs not working can you fix it mindset and tried a lot of other things so by the time they come to me they are more open to change
6535456 with physiotherapy you can receive some treatment and be shown all the exercises you need to do in say six sessions
6535457 with at theres no clear timescale or end point its a bit like learning a musical instrument at what point have you learned it
6535458 we dont diagnose and we dont treat our role comes after treatment and any good teacher will ideally work one to one in conjunction with the clients medical practitioner
6535459 pilates is brilliant for backs because it works the spine through all its planes of movement
6535460 extension flexion rotation and side flexion as well as teaching good body awareness and use improving breathing and posture
6535461 chiropractic is wrongly pereceived to be simply a manipulative technique thats just like saying dentists only do fillings
6535462 its actually a complete package of care which could involve everything from hands on treatment to postural assessment and stretching
6535463 symptoms are the last thing to come and the first thing to go so we tend to blame the problem on the last action we did rather than looking at the bigger picture
6535464 when a patient walks in yes i want to alleviate their pain but i also want to look at its cause and the aggravating factors because without addressing these the problem will return
6535465 the role of the osteopath is to help the individual manage themselves in ways that will optimise their recovery
6535466 treatment will likely involve a combination of hands on treatment movement re education and exercises to practise at home as well as the development of coping strategies
6535467 the level of sacrifice required to qualify for the combat action ribbon by engaging the enemy in combat should warrant the issuance of a corresponding medal
6535468 require no exceptional performance sacrifice or engagement of the enemy
6535469 we have awards in place that recognize combat action such as the bronze star and the combat
6535470 we constantly review our awards process but do not feel a change of this nature is warranted at this time
6535471 said the 24 year old sailor who asked that his name not be used for fear of retribution
6535472 the navy and marine corps achievement medal and the navy commendation medal those used to mean something not anymore now it just means you didnt catch a social disease while you were here or youre an e 7 who just showed up for work

6535475 as of this writing i have received 414 responses survey respondents were self selecting most heard about the survey through recruitment messages posted on several high traffic online messageboards devoted specifically to these game
6535476 the content and range of the qualitative responses in the surveys does seem to match the range of perspectives i have encountered through other research channels
6535477 while i must re emphasize the caveat that these statistics are not necessarily representative of all players it does seem important that nearly three quarters of respondents had played an instrument particularly given that respondents were recruited primarily from gamer discussion boards as opposed to some more specifically music oriented population
6535478 this fact stands in intriguing tension with the mission statement often repeated in media interviews with harmonix designers to give that awesome feeling of performing music to people who arent musicians who would never get to have it

6535482 when i heard about this it bothered me greatly as a parent
6535483 so many parents are not even aware that their children may have downloaded programs from the internet like that and as a result opened the familys personal information up to perfect strangers
6535484 to best protect yourself you need to continually update your virus protection software and educate your children on the dangers of downloading material without your knowledge or permission also arm yourself with knowledge it is illegal to download music or videos without properly paying copyright fees
6535485 it is impossible to separate the political from the commercial aspects of that display
6535486 for example the state argues that frazier can sell his shirts without displaying the soldiers names but fraziers product is his message and his customers message
6535487 what we have accomplished in this agreement is the most advanced version of any
6535488 because the u s negotiators indeed showed a great deal of flexibility and understanding
6535489 we recognize that the government still has to review this agreement and well await that process and then it obviously has to go to the council of representatives
6535490 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6535491 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6535492 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6535493 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6535494 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success

6535501 anyone who flew for the government had to get past him
6535502 were a bunch of loose cannons we have our own opinions but everything is in jest

6535514 if its mrs clinton thats the next president or if it is the breck girl or if its obama my guess is they will not pull us out of iraq theyre not going to do that theyre going to still engineer defeat dont suggest that ive changed my mind about the democrats owning defeat you dont have to be in the white house to secure defeat theyre doing everything they can to mobilize the enemy theyre doing everything they can to motivate the enemy theyre doing everything to de motivate and demoralize us troops but primarily you have to understand everything they do is through the political prism this is all about reacquiring the white house in this massive surge for power that theyre trying to get

6535519 in 1994 republicans took over control of this place congress

6535571 iran today is in a sense the only country where progressive ideas enjoy a vast constituency it is there that the ideas that i subscribe to are defended by a majority
6535572 iran is the only country in the world that has now had six elections since the first election of president khatami in 1997 it is the only one with elections including the united states including israel including you name it where the liberals or the progressives have won two thirds to 70 percent of the vote in six elections two for president two for the parliament the majlis two for the mayoralties in every single election the guys i identify with got two thirds to 70 percent of the vote there is no other country in the world i can say that about certainly not my own

6535575 its a sad story that really began in the 1950s when the united states deposed mr mossadegh who was an elected parliamentary democrat and brought the shah back and then he was overturned by the ayatollah khomeini driving us into the arms of one saddam hussein we got rid of the parliamentary democracy there back in the 50s at least that is my belief

6535795 gene was the rare man who could go through a knock down drag out fight and then be able to put that aside and forge a productive relationship with the other side
6535796 the period from 87 to 93 was a death match between the union and league
6535797 people have no idea of the personal attack gene took some real cloak and dagger stuff from the ownership side yet he was able to go from there and become a good partner with the league to keep the game strong
6535798 most of the people who i hear criticizing gene have no understanding of what he has done for this union
6535799 they dont know what the union was like when gene took over and what it is now
6535800 when gene took over we didnt even have money in the bank to make sure everybody got paid there were plenty of times when i wasnt sure if my paycheck was going to bounce now its not even a comparison what the players have in terms of both benefits and strength of the union
6535801 when you look at the growth in salaries alone you understand what gene has done
6535802 genes biggest job for the players was as a negotiator to take what the executive council asked for and get it every time he went in with the owners he got what we asked for and usually more
6535803 gene didnt always listen and he was stubborn but he knew what he was doing
6535804 the players in this league have never had a better friend than gene upshaw
6535805 hes one of the most gifted negotiators i ever saw and ive never seen a guy better under stress he never showed doubt or fatigue even in the darkest days
6535806 ser ambicioso e ir a por el partido con el objetivo de consolidar la imagen ofrecida en el encuentro de ida y evitar que esa imagen se convierta en un espejismo
6535807 debemos ir con la mentalidad de que tenemos opciones reales de ganar la supercopa
6535808 cualquiera de los de arriba tiene calidad suficiente para ganar la final
6535809 hay que dar pasos peque os y seguros porque no hay que olvidar que venimos del abismo ahora tenemos la posibilidad de ganar un t tulo y comenzar la liga cargados de confianza
6535810 ha de saber cuando vender a sus jugadores y es mejor hacer el esfuerzo para que ellos se queden convencidos comprometidos y con ilusi n que salir fuera a comprar jugadores de sus caracter sticas
6535811 se le da m s importancia de la que tiene
6535812 lo m s importante no es quien lleva el brazalete sino quien da la cara por el equipo en los momentos complicados lo importante es que la persona que lleve el brazalete est respaldado por el vestuario
6535813 ha sido algo realmente tr gico y que te marca
6535814 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife terri and their three sons eugene justin and daniel gene learned he was sick just this past sunday and he died with his family at his side we ask that the media respect our need to begin the process of dealing with this unexpected tragedy and to begin the grieving process
6535815 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights genes tremendous love of the game also showed in his wide ranging support of football at all levels it is a sad day for the nfl but genes positive impact and legacy will live on for decades to come all of us in the nfl reach out with our sympathy to terri and the upshaw family
6535816 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions gene was a super bowl champion and a very deserving member of the pro football hall of fame
6535817 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players playing alongside of gene was an honor and a privilege he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams
6535818 he was a giant in the nfl since entering the league in 1967 first as a hall of fame offensive lineman then as an active member of the collective bargaining process in the late 1970s and early 1980s and finally as the executive director of the nflpa gene continually served in the best interests of the game of football he played a colossal role in the success the nfl enjoys today even more than many people realize
6535819 hopefully everyone in this locker room recognizes that theyre a lot better for having gene as their leader he did so much every guy in this locker room can say they benefited from his leadership the league has benefited from his leadership the salaries are it is what it is our game is better from his leadership
6535820 with genes passing the nfl has lost an innovator players have lost their advocate and i have lost a friend a hall of fame player gene was also a hall of fame businessman and negotiator he always had the best interests of the nfl players at heart and that played a large role in building our league to the prominence it enjoys today
6535821 whether it was as a hall of fame offensive lineman with the oakland raiders or as executive director of the nfl players association gene was a tremendous leader and a wonderful person gene always believed the best way to build the popularity of our sport was to craft a dynamic partnership between the players and the owners that served the best interest of the fans
6535822 i have great respect for genes unprecedented hall of fame career i also admired gene upshaw the union leader for his leadership intelligence and partnership during his 25 year career with the nfl players association most importantly i admired gene upshaw the person he was a true gentleman and his contributions to our great game first as a high character highly skilled player and later as the head of the players union will never be forgotten
6535823 i knew gene for more than 30 years he was an extraordinary player perhaps the equal of anyone to ever play guard in the nfl after his long career as a player he dedicated his efforts to tirelessly working to improve the salaries benefits and working conditions of generations of nfl players we talked often about common issues and i will miss those conversations
6535824 i only had the opportunity to get to know gene upshaw over the last year but during the short period of time that i knew him i found gene to be an engaging and candid individual gene was a staunch advocate of nfl players rights and was concerned not only with the well being of his membership but for players in other professional sports as well
6535825 you are looking at a great player he is a guy from a players perspective that has done well through the players union he has done a really good job
6535826 from where the union started to where it is today is leaps and bounds a lot of that credit has to go with gene and what he stood for he stood his ground on a lot of key issues with the backing of the players he was able to get us in a pretty good position in terms of health benefits with the presidents at the time be it troy vincent and trace armstrong they worked to get us in a very good position and hes left us in a very good position
6535827 personally i owe a lot to gene i had the chance to work with him first as a player representative and then he gave me a start with the players association as an assistant executive director in 1985 after my playing career had ended i was impressed that he always had the best interests of the game in the forefront even though he remained a strong advocate for the players at the end of the day he always wanted to do what was right for the game
6535828 you lose a guy who has been in the fire for a long time he has been around before a lot of us even thought about playing in the nfl he has been doing it since guys went on strike back in the day before we knew anything about it we lose a lot of knowledge a great person a great human being and someone who was leading in the right direction
6535829 gene upshaw was a leader on and off the fields of friendly strife he personified strength and integrity in both his football career as well as president of the nflpa he channeled that strength with dignity and determination for the betterment of the nfl as well as players past and present all who played the game know of his great contributions in directing the players union but also his passion for the game and for the future of youth football thats the gene upshaw i will remember
6535830 today the 49ers stand side by side with our cross bay rival team the raiders in mourning the passing of a great player on the field and a great leader off the field for 14 years upshaw set the standard on one of the best offensive lines in the game
6535831 in his position representing the players i felt like gene was always very frank and fair when he came in and visited the club he wouldnt come here to visit without wanting to sit down and talk for 15 minutes to see how our players were doing and what else was going on how were they doing how was i doing a time didnt go by when he didnt do that and i appreciated that
6535832 he is a man i have always admired and respected through hard work and perseverance gene accomplished so much in his life he was passionate about the game of football and dedicated much of his adult life to improving the game not just for the benefit of the players but for the benefit of all our fans too his many on field accomplishments earned him a place among the all time greats in the pro football hall of fame but his contributions to the game go way beyond the playing field his union leadership has been one of the key factors to the exponential growth that the league and all of its players have enjoyed over the past two decades gene represented the players the way i would want to be represented with understanding integrity and a steadfast commitment to doing what was right for them and what was best for the game
6535833 i was so sure the girls would redeem brazil after argentina humiliated us
6535834 they played better and deserved to win but it just didnt happen well have to wait another four years
6535835 the brazilian team deserved to win in regulation time they pressured nonstop and would have scored several times but the adversarys goalkeeper destroyed every attempt
6535836 they ran so much that by the time they returned to the field they were exhausted and lost to players who were in better physical shape they lost to the most successful team in the history of womens soccer
6535837 i hate my job and i want you to help me get one that i like
6535838 do you want to get a job you like or do you want to like the job you have
6535839 the past is the past and if this doesnt make people forgive and talk to me about this all the time i dont know what will
6535840 there were days when this was only a dream now its a reality
6535841 we have to see the positive side of things and that is that nothing stays hidden
6535842 all federations need to do their homework but the public can see that everything is brought into the open
6535843 when the president gave him the honor of carrying the flag in the opening ceremonies
6535844 we knew it would be much more difficult in manus heart to stay away it wasnt like he needed any pressure to get him to play though
6535845 theres not much of a chance only a very very small one
6535846 hes one of the top players in the nba and if you ask me hes even better for them because hes the man on that team
6535847 these guys are probably the toughest competitors in the olympics
6535848 i admire him probably the same way i did with michael jordan
6535849 but the difference was he was representing me with the argentine jersey that changes everything
6535850 a generation of players that will be difficult to replicate
6535851 its probably best that were not allowed to make those decisions for players because obviously national teams present risks not only with injury but with length of career and cumulative fatigue
6535852 but weve also built our program with great respect for national team representation pop and owner peter holt understand its what makes our guys great
6535853 the u s team had limos lined up at the hotel to get them out of town as fast as they could
6535854 you looked in that room and after a crushing loss when they had gotten screwed in the gold medal game against and they were all there together some of them had their kids on their knees they were just so passionate about competing together about being together they didnt like leaving each other
6535855 we are strongly encouraging corporations that value their products and reputations to join forces with us in order to put those who steal your product out of business in jail or both hiring a former agent from the fbi or waiting for global law enforcement to help is a pipe dream with a serious global recession looming corporations cannot just sit by while someone else makes amp resells their product the epicenter of all of this is china and india
6535856 we had no idea how vast the problem is nor did we understand that virtually every legitimate corporate manufactured product is being counterfeited in china or india with the increasing probability of a severe global recession americas watchdog is urging corporations to utilize the very unique services offered by the global piracy amp counterfeiting consultants
6535857 the top ten global pharma companies are each losing billions of u s dollars a year to pharmaceutical counterfeiting the big tobacco companies are each losing billions of dollars per year to counterfeit cigarettes 200 billion of which are made in china auto parts manufacturers are losing billions a year sporting goods or entertainment companies are losing billions of dollars a year etc it has to stop and we have an integrated approach that will identify the counterfeit product retailers wholesalers and manufacturers there is nothing even close to our capabilities in the world
6535858 big pharmaceutical companies have done a pathetic job of protecting their brands and consumers are probably dying because of it
6535859 do not purchase any product on the internet unless you are 100 satisfied you are purchasing the authentic product amp it is produced by the legitimate manufacturer

6535867 after a couple of years of wanting to collaborate with alicia keys it took james bond himself to finally make it happen alicia put some electric energy into her breath that cemented itself into the magnetic tape very inspiring to watch it gave me a new voice and i wasnt myself anymore i drummed for her voice and she mimicked the guitar tones then we joined our voices and screamed and moaned about these characters in the film and their isolation having no one to trust not even themselves maybe we became them for a few minutes the memphis horns were there to help us out along with some of nashvilles finest might be the first analogue bond theme in twenty years i dont know we wanted to push soul into those tapes and join the family of barry bassey connery and craig

6535947 its about what people become when they get into their cars
6535948 this is our country and we have to save it lets debate this for however long we want but the house should find a solution and tell the government how to deal with the situation
6535949 we cannot allow terrorists to challenge the writ of the government how is it fair that terrorists can give the government one week time to resign and threaten to start bombing if they dont get their way we have to secure the lives and property of our people if we do not stop them now tomorrow they may attack this very house they may cause a terrorist incident inside the house they may take the members hostage
6535950 the war on terror cannot be won on defensive we have to take the battle to the doorsteps of the extremists
6535951 we are not being attacked by any outside military or a known army our enemy lurks silently within our society this is our own war
6535952 utilizing selective arrests and prosecutions the federal government has sought to sabotage californias reasoned approach to medical marijuana use
6535953 for the first time a court has recognized that a calculated plan by the federal government to undercut state medical marijuana laws is patently unconstitutional todays decision forecasts an end to any organized federal effort to sabotage state medical marijuana laws
6535954 it is obvious to anyone paying attention that federal officials have gone to great lengths to sabotage state efforts to allow for appropriate medical marijuana use
6535955 the court made clear that this deliberate interference once proved would be unequivocally unconstitutional
6535956 we expected today to be about gcse results and what you then find is one of the youngsters who has worked very hard for their gcses has been the victim of this tragedy so people are very shocked and upset
6535957 he didnt get into trouble he was at home most of the time he always helped people out if he could
6535958 the victim was with a group of friends on the 13th floor of a tower block when they became concerned about another group of youths cycling towards the tower block
6535959 this caused the victim and his friends to leave the area the victim was separated from his friends
6535960 he climbed on to the outside of the tower block via an open balcony and then climbed down several floors trying to escape
6535961 he reached the seventh floor when he could no longer carry on after this point he fell to his death
6535962 the other group involved are described as black male youths some were wearing hooded tops others were wearing bandanas and were riding pedal cycles
6535963 ministers have undermined confidence in the exam system so more and more independent schools are choosing alternative qualifications such as the igcse
6535964 unfortunately the government refuses to allow state schools to do these new exams so richer families get another advantage over poorer families we would allow all state schools to do these new exams so that all children have the same chance to take these high quality qualifications
6535965 we believed the igcse was a far better course than the national curriculum version because there was no coursework involved this enabled us to teach the boys the core subjects for longer and the result has been successful beyond our imagination
6535966 we do not agree that the igcse is in any way superior to the gcse it is aimed at international students and therefore does not major on english cultural or historical concepts and achievements the igcse debate is a distraction parents care about having more good schools and that is precisely what we are delivering
6535967 growing awareness among students teachers and their parents about what their options are
6535968 it makes sense for students to concentrate on eight or nine gcses rather than 11 or 12 and to do them well

6535981 we would like to thank volvo for helping to protect our lives
6535982 as he climbed out of his car he grabbed hold of something it was a memorial cross someone else had died in an accident at the very same spot
6535983 the car was a write off my daughters head hit the window on the passenger side but all three of them were able to get out and walk away from the car
6535984 that was a really bad week for us but even though the tree fell onto the hood the car would still start and it was still drivable although i have had to let it go as a result it was the apple of my eye it had done almost 500 000 miles
6535985 naturally very disappointing these things do happen but on average once every 50 pit stops or even less now it happened twice in the same race what is definitely positive is that we have taken 50 of all the pole positions this year and our qualifying margins are growing also we have made a big step forward to reduce tyre wear under the race our lap times towards the end of the races are continuously getting better now we need to have patience and continue to push
6535986 to the law and to the testimony if they do not speak according to this word they have no light of dawn

6536007 it was hard and this win wasnt just down to my goal
6536008 its the greatest feeling its my first olympics and my first olympic gold medal
6536009 the more minutes together the better we played and ive been working for nine months now with this team and it was about finding the rhythm and in the way we believed in attack
6536010 it is a hard moment i dont know what to say
6536011 it was not a lack of opportunities but rather it was a lack of patience on the one shot the usa had they scored and whoever scores the goal wins we lost focus after the americans scored

6536016 the signing of djibril shows how far this club has moved on since the end of last season
6536017 his experience will bring a lot to the squad and he will hopefully add some goals to the side he is known for scoring them as well as creating them
6536018 im really pleased to join a good club with good players sunderland is a club i think is going to achieve things they have big ambitions thats why i chose to come here i liked what the club had to say to me
6536019 security forces arrested him when he tried to enter nouadhibou and turned him over to the police who are bringing him to the capital now
6536020 preparing a coup to be carried out on august 9
6536021 a group of heavily armed men wanted to kidnap him and he was shot after the plan aborted
6536022 he was very shocked by the attack but he was unable to explain who his assailants were
6536023 there was a plan to kidnap him and demand a ransom we are getting some information about the identity of the attackers and we will take immediate action
6536024 the evidence is overwhelming that there is a specialized system dedicated to processing faces and not other objects
6536025 why we are so good at recognizing and remembering faces
6536026 a brief glance at a face conveys a wealth of information about identity expression gender age mood intent attractiveness social states and even honesty
6536027 the ability to extract this information within a fraction of a second of viewing a face is important for normal social interaction and has probably played a critical role in the survival of our primate ancestors
6536028 are completely baffled why robbers cover their faces in movies
6536029 its like viewing grains of sugar rather than the whole cube
6536030 a region could serve more than one function said scott huettel a professor of psychiatry at duke university in durham n c
6536031 just by looking at an fmri we can tell if a subject is looking at faces or places
6536032 it tells us what kinds of minds we have and that is one of the most fundamental questions i can imagine tackling
6536033 im looking for character more than anything you could be the greatest musician in the world but if you stand in jeans and a t shirt next to me no one will notice you

6536036 i told you she was good sure hope e remembers us little folks when she makes it big time
6536037 our efforts to become genuinely anti racist are hampered by another liberal ambivalence that history helps to make clear
6536038 our deep seated fear of community when combined with our tendency toward formalism and abstraction leads to a deep fear of otherness that we have barely begun to recognize and address
6536039 liberal political and social theory too often echoed in liberal religion tends to protect the individual from the community from true engagement with the other this kind of negative freedom tends to produce a constricted sense of self but a love based understanding of the community would extend the individual and expand the self outward toward the other this sort of re conception of community seems essential if we are serious about our anti racism work

6536042 disk drives are constantly increasing in capacity and were keeping up
6536043 by the end of this year we should have a 750 gigabyte cartridge available and in the next 18 months we will have a terabyte cartridge
6536044 our strategy from the beginning when we first launched this product line was to create a single industry standard
6536045 and as we add more pc vendors to our client base i think we will see a domino effect occur where vendors recognize rdx as the chosen standard to the detriment of all other media types
6536046 in most enterprises were seeing companies employ a two tiered system with rdx as the lower tier and tape for everything else
6536047 but as rdx improves and companies migrate their infrastructure i think well see that migration to rdx happen overtime
6536048 these are not guys who typically see eye to eye and theyre all of the same mind
6536049 it seems to me theres a lot of unknowns here
6536050 id like to see the board to take action to get the legal staff to get whomever involved an opportunity to work through the things weve heard this morning and the board to go ahead and implement this jan 1 2010
6536051 board meetings are characterized by open and free wheeling discussions its not uncommon for board meetings afterward to have to go back and clarify what actions were taken
6536052 the agreement was staff was going to deal with implementation details and get back to the board but there was no question on the whether to have a surcharge and the only number i heard referred to was 25
6536053 my intention was the surcharge would be 25 based on the practice of other states

6536061 reactive oxygen species lead to oxidative stress in the body which can also cause dna damage we were able to gather clear evidence of a short term increase in certain indicators for oxidative stress during the competition and have already published these results however now we were also able to demonstrate that despite this increase no notable and persistent damage was caused to the athletes dna this is a surprising result which initially appears to contradict the data gathered in similar studies
6536062 the comparable studies analysed different biomarkers for predominantly short lived dna damage our study focused primarily on damage to dna that was subsequently evident in daughter cells following cell division and could therefore be of long term detriment to the body however we can sound the all clear in this respect our study clearly shows that in this case extreme competitive sport did not result in any increase in dna damage

6536069 thats not the way we perceive being a champion i have no problem with him doing a show i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100m
6536070 i understand the joy he might have interpreted it in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6536071 he must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s
6536072 he still has to mature he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that
6536073 i guess theres mixed feelings among athletes to me i dont feel like hes being disrespectful if this guy has worked his tail off every day on his knees throwing up like i was in practice he deserves to dance
6536074 a lot of people are hoping i will go to the 400m but dont hold your breath

6536087 you have the dollar down over 1 today and that is a pretty meaningful move for the dollar
6536088 running back to gold running back to oil so it seems we are seeing some of the running back to safe haven
6536089 the risk factors are back on the rise with the latest fears about fannie mae and freddie mac and that seems to have captured the imagination of the market
6536090 if the dollar does fall off a lot of these guys foreign investors are able to consume more and buy more on a pure dollar per dollar basis
6536091 when you consider that russia is a major exporter of oil outside of opec and is a major supplier of oil the threat of a supply disruption
6536092 the speculation is that we are drawing closer to the actual realization of any production being pulled offline in russia
6536093 the reason why gas supplies are so tight is because refineries are not making any demand is not there
6536094 we are going up for the same reasons we went to the highs concerns about the dollar the economy the feds ability to raise interest rates

6536118 the falling dollar seems to be the primary catalyst for the fall in commodities
6536119 there are inflation buyers who are scared by paper problems at lehman fannie and freddie so theyre using commodities as a flight to quality investment
6536120 demand is still strong especially after prices fell to 111
6536121 wall street analysts keep saying the commodity bubble has burst but the bubble isnt over because demand is still strong

6536129 we ve had folks from china and japan visit the oilsands in previous years and now we ve had some very high profile wealthy people form the u s to go and take a look
6536130 the visit may be somewhat symbolic in a way but i don t expect warren buffett or bill gates to go out and start buying oilsands companies at this point i think they re just going up there to kick the tires and see what it s all about
6536131 we d be very surprised if this was a precursor to a major investment on their part especially on the part of warren buffett
6536132 he looks to invest in companies at the bottom of the cycle and there s no reason to believe that we re at the bottom of the current commodity price cycle
6536133 it s more likely that warren buffett and bill gates were brought to the oilsands area as a form of damage control
6536134 the most likely future investors especially given the rising environmental lobby in the states against the oilsands would be companies from northeast asia
6536135 they re not going to be able to produce domestically to satisfy their needs and they re looking elsewhere

6536201 i think an objective analysis would say ive been right a lot more than he has for all his years in washington
6536202 who goes around spending all their their time insulting people
6536203 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6536204 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
6536205 its one big step forward in improving the safety of fresh produce
6536206 its expensive and it doesnt really address the problem at the source

6536216 to halt international military co operation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6536217 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military co operation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6536218 we still have some very important issues that we need to work with russia on
6536219 its a whole series of things that are not very important theyve got important sounding titles but reality of that nato russia council is they look for things to talk about
6536220 theres plenty of agenda items but theres not much substance in them
6536221 en una confrontaci n tan intensa como la actual donde se presentan centenares de combates diariamente y miles de hechos de guerra por todo el territorio nacional es entendible que se presenten adem s de muertes capturas de integrantes de las fuerzas en lucha

6536233 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6536234 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6536235 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6536236 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses

6536238 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6536239 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6536240 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6536241 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6536242 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
6536243 its one big step forward in improving the safety of fresh produce

6536259 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6536260 planned parenthood continues to be concerned that the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6536261 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6536262 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6536263 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience
6536264 we got a chuckle out of it if tony wanted to call her and be with her he would
6536265 i like to help people but im here to follow my dreams
6536266 i think setting an artificial timetable for withdrawal is a significant mistake it is it sends and bad signals to the region and to the iraqi citizens listen the iraqis are wondering whether or not were going to stay to help people in america wonder whether or not theyve got the political will to do the hard work
6536267 and if the congress wants to test my will as to whether or not ill accept the timetable for withdrawal i wont accept one i just dont think its in the interest of our troops i think it im just envisioning what it would be like to be a young soldier in the middle of iraq and realizing that politicians have all of a sudden made military determinations and in my judgment that would put a kid in harms way more so than he or she already is
6536268 theres a temptation to let the politics at home get in the way with the considered judgment of the commanders

6536282 what is said every day the people of the south have rejected the constitutional amendment and therefore we will march upon them and force them to adopt it at the point of the bayonet and establish military power over them until they do adopt it
6536283 if congress shall break up the present union by unconstitutionally putting strife and enmity and armed hostility between different sections of the country instead of the domestic tranquility which the constitution was meant to insure will not all the states be absolved from their federal obligations then the union must utterly perish at the moment when congress shall arm one part of the people against another for any purpose beyond that of merely protecting the general government in the exercise of its proper constitutional functions

6536285 who are citizens in the state in which they reside
6536286 law of nations named out here spoke only of the one written by emmerich de vattel written in 1758 and was thereby fully incorporated in our constitution word for word as stated by john jay to all the grand juries he instructed around the circuits
6536287 the constitution is certain and fixed it contains the permanent will of the people and is the supreme law of the land it is paramount to the power of the legislature and can be revoked or altered only by the authority that made it what are legislatures creatures of the constitution they owe their existence to the constitution they derive their power from the constitution it is their commission and therefore all their acts must be conformable to it or else they will be void the constitution is the work or will of the people themselves in their original sovereign and unlimited capacity law is the work or will of the legislature in their derivative or subordinate capacity the one is the work of the creator and the other of the creature the constitution fixes limits to the exercise of the legislative authority and prescribes the orbit within which it must move whatever may be the case in other countries yet in this there can be no doubt that every act of the legislature repugnant to the constitution is absolutely void

6536328 the ip incident involving men coming for army recruitment and ip hostel girls was a slap on the face of all those who say that du is safe for women the immediate concern for those in power should be to make du a space where students can study without fear
6536329 students are at the core of every revolution across the world that needs to be the case in du as well also there ought to be greater funding for students from lower income groups

6536379 the american people need a choice they want a choice they deserve a choice
6536380 bob barrs independent candidacy will allow oklahoman voters a real choice this november even though our states antiquated ballot laws kept our party off the ballot this year we expect barrs conservative message of limited government and personal responsibility will resonate with oklahomans
6536381 it would be great for voters to have three choices for president was the only state limited to just two choices for president in 2004 and the last time we had an independent presidential candidate was ross perot in 1992

6536383 while republicans and democrats will fight for their own power libertarians will fight for americans bob barr is one of the strongest candidates in the partys 37 year history and we look for him to have an enormous impact in the 2008 race

6536396 according to romans 13 1 christians have a responsibility to obey the civil authorities we should obey the laws of the land yet no earthly power has the authority to intervene between the individual conscience and god the commands of god supersede the human laws of state if any state passes laws requiring its citizens to violate gods law gods people are always subject to the higher law of god

6536426 we had dreams that computers would improve education and improve communication and help us achieve a lot of tasks a lot of us in our group understood it
6536427 what we were doing was not figuring out how build a computer it was how you get a computer that fits into the home price looks a lot of that stuff it gave us more passion we used the word revolution all over the place
6536428 i was doing really advanced computer designs when i was 10
6536429 i just loved computers and what they were and ones and zeros and the logic and how they added
6536430 sometimes when youre short of resources it forces you to do better work
6536431 i couldnt afford an online timeshare computer system i had to write down ones and zeros and simulate the computers operations it was all done by hand never once on a computer

6536451 andrew was certainly unlucky he and tom ashley were the guys who really stepped up and sailed very well
6536452 the others didnt quite take their chances but it was a very random place to sail we always knew there was a risk of variable results and we saw that
6536453 there wasnt quite enough consistency they were one or two races short of a really good result

6536482 the major reason is the omneon equipment for us the ability to share clips and to secure them with no tape to misplace makes a tremendous difference and as for setup once the network with the fcp stations has been established its a matter of plugging it in hooking up the wire flipping a switch and its done we are happy and confident going on the road with omneon
6536483 a local station competing in 24 7 news in the discerning new york market has tremendous pressures the decision by ny1 to leverage cutting edge technology for efficiency gains and to adopt the spectrum system for its all in one solution for field production helps the station address these pressures and deliver the high quality content expected by its viewers
6536484 it comes from a candidate who said he was against this kind of thing

6536506 im very proud of the extraordinary work that our artistic team in the directors office has done to put together the 2009 season over the past few months all of us on this team want very much to be a part of something truly great
6536507 our approach to creating a season is artist driven we havent simply come up with a list of plays and slotted people in we have encouraged artists to come forward with their own dream projects we see our responsibility as supporting those artists to help them fulfill their dreams and visions this is the best way to serve not only them but our audiences the key to creating transcendent theatre is having passionate people at the helm of each production
6536508 im delighted that the 2009 season will bring together many of the festivals favourite artists as well as some of the finest new talent
6536509 we have created a playbill that builds on the excellent work accomplished in the 2008 season and positions the festival well for the future
6536510 its important for us as a classical repertory theatre to have living playwrights in our midst
6536511 it helps keep us honest in our approach to the classics reminding us that our productions must speak to burning contemporary issues and the important subjects of our own times
6536512 the classics feed and inform new plays just as our own writers help us to focus on the pertinence of the classics
6536513 he is certainly our greatest playwright but to truly know his work it is vital to explore the plays of his contemporaries which is why we present ben jonsons rollicking city comedy bartholomew fair in the coming seasons we hope to continue expanding our elizabethan jacobean repertoire and produce works by marlowe kidd middleton and the other great playwrights from shakespeares scene

6536530 bristol is not required to offer school choice for any of our schools
6536531 i know what its like to make big shots and to win a playoff series or two ive reshaped my game to make a good team into a scary one
6536532 ive only been to the conference semis how do i get further
6536533 execution you have to focus on xs and os on how you want to take your opponent apart thats what its about its not about the crowd being loud or how many towels they wave
6536534 the trick is to get everybody playing together trying to accomplish the same goal if you have the talent and the sacrifice on top of that you have a championship caliber team one player can only do so much if you havent gotten to the next level you havent figured out how to get everybody on the same page
6536535 id never been on a winning team that got along prior to 2008 when i was young i was like take it or leave it trains gotta keep moving if you want to win a championship if youre slacking im going to let you know and that went from shaq down to rick fox but when you have that togetherness you dont get into finger pointing if a guy makes a mistake loses a game everyone plays the next game to redeem him that attitude was critical to our getting the number one seed this year
6536536 everybody has all the cliches you have to sacrifice you have to be on the same page but theyre all true when youre on a team that isnt championship caliber nobody looks around and says youve got the better matchup tonight lets ride that you cant care about whos going to be on sportscenter s top plays whos going to be in espn the magazine whos making the all star team when you win everyone gets the glory
6536537 one of the main things is and i may be biased great guard play a great center is a plus but it doesnt matter who your center is if your guards cant get the ball to him
6536538 my first three years sometimes he was so hard on me he made me cry
6536539 it seemed like i could never do enough for him but when i was finals mvp his eyes were watering and mine too thats why it gives me goose bumps anytime i see anyone win a championship i know how it feels to work hard all year just so you can hold that trophy at the end
6536540 my first finals everything went so fast i didnt realize what i was doing and what i was part of i enjoyed the second time more but the third is when i saw everything in slow motion everything was so easy

6536548 all the new dancers in the finals had black and blue knees
6536549 i put makeup on my knees to hide the bruises
6536550 competing was really cool because it feels like all the hard work has paid off if you do well
6536551 sometimes you dont do well and thats a learning experience too
6536552 dancing at osu was a big time commitment without any help from the college
6536553 i always looked up to the blazer dancers but i didnt think it would actually happen
6536554 i didnt really have a regular childhood because i was at gymnastic classes four times a week
6536555 i had competitions on weekends and that didnt leave me much time to hang out
6536556 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6536557 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
6536558 its one big step forward in improving the safety of fresh produce
6536559 its expensive and it doesnt really address the problem at the source
6536560 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession
6536561 the decline in the leading index should therefore not be interpreted as a sign the outlook is quickly deteriorating
6536562 thats critical while consumers may be cautious and conservative in their spending as long as the rate does not spike there should be enough income growth to keep the economy muddling along
6536563 has lost 10 partners in the past year and its overall head count is down considerably
6536564 its not like we were doing it behind closed doors
6536565 scrutinizing our direct and indirect expenses and looking at our staffing needs in new york and d c
6536566 laid off less than 7 percent of attorneys and staff
6536567 to eliminate any redundancies and to try to improve our internal operating efficiency
6536568 we wanted to make sure we had all the appropriate people in the office
6536569 robs passion coupled with the knowledge that he has gained from the past five years with providence makes him a good fit for us
6536570 we believe strongly in cultivating talent within the bruins family and rob is a good example of someone who deserved a promotion given his commitment to the organization
6536571 you know that you are in the frontline in the fight against the taliban you know that by what you are doing here you prevent terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6536572 this week we are celebrating the olympics where we have had great success but this week also i believe that our olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that you have showed exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication you make our country proud every day of the week and every week of the year you are truly the heroes of our country
6536573 but i call this a scratch and not a wound
6536574 now hast thou gotten a good mark befitting thee and even such should more of you have
6536575 nought good is the mark yet most like it is that i shall have the heart to bear it manfully little have ye yet to brag over
6536576 maybe the widow will think the kissing of thee worsened
6536577 long hath it been not over good and now must it be much spoilt forsooth yet it may be that thou wilt not tell thereof to thy sweetheart
6536578 but this i am sure of that his bill is at home
6536579 thus we break spear shafts my lads let us go briskly on nothing hurts me
6536580 i think setting an artificial timetable for withdrawal is a significant mistake it is it sends mixed signals and bad signals to the region and to the iraqi citizens listen the iraqis are wondering whether or not were going to stay to help people in america wonder whether or not theyve got the political will to do the hard work
6536581 and if the congress wants to test my will as to whether or not ill accept the timetable for withdrawal i wont accept one i just dont think its in the interest of our troops i think it im just envisioning what it would be like to be a young soldier in the middle of iraq and realizing that politicians have all of a sudden made military determinations and in my judgment that would put a kid in harms way more so than he or she already is
6536582 the prime minister says what iraq and her people now need is time not a timetable they seek our patience not political posturing they require resolve not our retreat were going to succeed in iraq if given a chance liberty will succeed every time and liberty will help yield the peace we need
6536583 theres a temptation to let the politics at home get in the way with the considered judgment of the commanders thats why i strongly rejected an artificial timetable of withdrawal its kind of like an arbitrary thing you know we will decide in the halls of congress how to conduct our affairs in iraq based upon polls and politics and were going to impose this on people as opposed to listening to our commanders and our diplomats and listening to the iraqis for that matter
6536584 in the area of security cooperation the president and the prime minister agreed that improving conditions should allow for the agreements now under negotiation to include a general time horizon for meeting aspirational goals
6536585 anytime you can see others performing you can pick something up and its good training environment and in a convention of this nature youre bringing from all walks of the state together so everybody gains through something like this
6536586 i cant express how honored i am to represent bill at the democratic national convention
6536587 bill loved helping and serving people he wanted to make arkansas better for everyone
6536588 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
6536589 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6536590 mr ayers is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something that i deplore 40 years ago when i was 6 or 7 years old
6536591 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6536592 when the american public fully understands the close continuing relationship between their potential president and a remorseless domestic terrorist we believe it will send a chill down their spines
6536593 however it should be noted that there are facts in this case that are disputed including the findings of the medical examiner and urge that judgment be withheld until the legal proceedings are complete
6536594 its a challenge for the batsmen theres no point playing on flat tracks and scoring 300 runs all the time
6536595 from a players point of view this is a great challenge
6536596 curiously mahendra singh dhoni did not seem to read the pitch particularly well on either occasion choosing to bat first the first time and then suggesting that the pitch may not have had that much in it for the fast bowlers in the second match despite choosing to field
6536597 this was a very deceptive wicket i thought there was less grass and perhaps it wouldnt assist the seamers
6536598 but there was some help for the fast bowlers consistently
6536599 the seamers from both teams enjoyed the conditions over at dambulla picking up 19 of the 29 wickets to fall but they might just find the going tough at the r premadasa stadium where the remaining matches will be played
6536600 its really tough for the bowlers in sri lanka most of the time in sri lanka its not a bowlers paradise
6536601 yes it feels good to see that so many boxers after us are doing well and raising the bar you can say its an improvement on the good work started by us
6536602 these days even sub juniors get three four exposure trips every year so stage fright or lack of experience isnt a problem when they graduate into the senior sections
6536603 then you were lucky if you got one exposure trip per year at the junior level forget sub juniors we used to turn up at international events as strangers thanks to the federation which manages funds on its own when the government says no this has changed you can say these boxers are products of a system they are talented but to come this far wouldnt have been possible if a system was not in place
6536604 no doubt that the cuban would be a very tough opponent

6536617 despite a pledge by moscow to withdraw its forces to the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia by friday russian troops still showed not signs thursday of relaxing their grip on critical georgian roads and ports
6536618 are part of georgia and the united states will work with our allies to ensure georgias independence and territorial integrity
6536619 russia made clear on wednesday that it had no intention of bowing to natos calls for a withdrawal to the positions its forces held before the invasion of georgia
6536620 the upper and lower houses of russias parliament agreed to convene next week to discuss the recognition of independence of abkhazia and south ossetia
6536621 these breakaway republics remaining georgias parts is out of the question
6536622 europeans are frustrated and annoyed by russias foot dragging on a cease fire deal to pull back its troops from most of georgia but few want this conflict to be the start of a new confrontation and many feel a degree of sympathy with russia the united states has talked in cold war terms with secretary of state condoleezza rice comparing the russian move to the soviet invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 but many european leaders believe that mr saakashvili acted rashly when he sent his troops to take over the autonomous ethnic enclave of south ossetia bringing down much of the destruction upon his own head
6536623 german chancellor merkel is emerging as a pivotal player in reshaping the wests relations with moscow
6536624 reduce divisions over russia between the eus old and new members and move europe closer to the u s on the need to prevent russia from reasserting control over neighbors
6536625 russia was involved in this crisis as a result of saakashvilis adventure who would not have dared for it without outside help russia could not have stayed inactive and so a response followed and the aggression was stopped the decision by president dmitry medvedev about termination of military operations is a right and responsible step the russian president has been acting cool confidently and firmly in case someone had been calculating on confusion in moscow that calculating failed
6536626 president saakashvili had every right to send troops to south ossetia it is georgian territory
6536627 like the soviet union russia today is still not willing to accept the sovereignty of its smaller neighbors sure russia has transformed itself since the days of the soviet union and one can hardly deny the positive changes however the imperialistic great power attitude has remained the same and is still enforced with tanks if smaller countries dare to oppose
6536628 whilst it is easy to expose cracks in the alliance germany and france remain more skeptical of georgian nato membership than the u

6536634 i dont want to elaborate on these now but we did face some very difficult times for us
6536635 we had a couple of sponsors lined up but none gave us any commitment they simply backed out
6536636 of late we have been getting whatever we wanted we have procured good quality boxing gloves and bandages we had a couple of training cum exposure trips in germany and kazakhstan that really helped us
6536637 his presence helps us indian railways has sponsored his trip and his presence here has also helped the boxers in training

6536643 physiotherapy is a very specialised field i have been asking for physios and masseurs for while but with heath coming into the support staff i could focus on purely on boxing
6536644 we have sessions with the boxers then we try to flush out all the negative elements from their mind and try to build on their confidence
6536645 so now the boxers are very confident they dont think about whom they are playing
6536646 the nutritionist mathews who also tried his hand at fast bowling for durban was ecstatic on wednesday
6536647 when he first joined the camp in patiala in may he was shocked to see the boxerss diet
6536648 the intake of the fat content used to very high and the value of nutrition was not good
6536649 boxing where one has to keep his weight under check without losing power must have the best nutrition so i have chalked out a plan for them that worked to reduce their weight without diminishing their power
6536650 what we had been dreaming for decades finally came true and 8230 the boys have given an olympic medal to the country
6536651 before going to beijing our best performance in the sport was by gurcharan singh who reached the quarterfinal in the 2000 sydney games olympics
6536652 after the 1998 asian games gold by dingko singh we had high hopes from him as well as from gurcharan but unfortunately he missed the medal

6536664 the decision came in the form of a letter from the clerk of the supreme court that indicated justice souter had denied the request
6536665 i appreciate that he accepted our motion and acted very quickly on it and rendered a decision
6536666 by acting in the rapid fashion that he did justice souter has allowed us the time to pursue other options
6536667 there are a couple of legal avenues that are available
6536668 theres even another one that is available to people that signed the petition that is independent of the candidate their constitutional rights are in question because of this
6536669 thats a difficult burden because theres a tremendous amount of collegiality on the court
6536670 i dont want to say what it is at this time
6536671 that would likely benefit future candidates that are in the same position but not mr hoffman
6536672 if they take action it would be a new and separate proceeding than the one we are involved in were dealing with people of principle they may keep fighting for their first amendment rights thats what drives mr hoffman and his supporters
6536673 we want to be clear that mr hoffman is impressed by the integrity of the maine secretary of state and attorney general in this process
6536674 they stood by what is right and were not influenced by partisan politics

6536704 this reality means that there will be a hard fought campaign centering on this initiative in the coming months
6536705 during that campaign we call upon both sides to avoid portraying ohio as unfriendly to business and economic development

6536742 there are hundreds of thousands of pounds to be made but the guys who buy in london and sell in the west country arent the bad guys
6536743 the errors are being made by mortgage lenders and their advisors in taking it to london in the first place
6536744 youd have thought the mortgage lenders would have wanted to make the best price rather than give an easy profit to someone
6536745 certainly the impression we are getting as we go through the responses is that most lenders have gone for the original mortgage exit administration fee option
6536746 around 10 million mortgages have been redeemed in the last four years
6536747 but the number of people who claim compensation will no doubt be largely influenced by the amount of media coverage this topic receives

6536749 former customers will have to be pro active about this
6536750 the figures suggest that in the short term the recent strength in the housing market will support consumer spending

6536773 the strong economic growth and rising employment enjoyed by the uk at present is supporting housing demand even in the face of recent increases in interest rates
6536774 while activity is past its peak and should slow gradually in coming months price rises will continue as the market moves towards a soft landing

6536786 we found significant failings in the advice giving processes in a number of mortgage firms
6536787 poor processes increase the risk of unsuitable advice being given
6536788 it is essential that firms have robust processes in place so that they treat their customers fairly and provide suitable advice
6536789 job training to upgrade the skills of tennessees workers is one of the best things we can do for our economy

6536811 there is a real shortage of accommodation both to rent and to buy as hospital trusts have sold off a lot of on site nurses accommodation

6537036 its a very sad day i heard this morning probably around five oclock i came in to work out and someone told me it was on the radio then we confirmed it
6537037 it goes way back a lot of people dont know that some people see him now and some people have different opinions about the guy but the guy was about the national football league he was about the integrity of the league he was about how the players handled their job on a professional football field and he loved the game theres no doubt about it he did everything in his power to make sure that the players understood that this is an important league theres a little fraternity of players and youve got to respect that so with that said its going to be a big loss no ones ever going to fill his shoes theyll have another guy to represent the players and all that he did a lot taught me a lot as a young player and hes going to be missed
6537038 played against him in the super bowl played against him a couple times you know we were in hawaii a couple times together and he was a heck of a football player he was a raider thats for sure he was a true raider he will be missed
6537039 its like anything else in life you have choices to make and people have attitudes about how they want to handle things i just think sometimes you dont have all the information when you sit in a chair like he sits in youre not going to please all the rank and file its for the betterment of the rank and file its for the whole its not for a few guys i think a lot of things go unsaid stories get spun different ways but i think at the end hes meant a lot for this league hes done a lot for this league
6537040 i dont know what happened to him i think he tweaked his knee or something well find out
6537041 hes doing okay hes doing all right hes got a lot to learn but hes getting better he really is hes a very powerful guy in the run game hes just got to learn pass protection at this level he played left tackle in college now hes at right so thats a new form of footwork hes got an upside we feel
6537042 its part of football you cant prevent injuries they happen life goes on the next guy gets an opportunity which is the good thing about it its not season ending hes going to come back he had a good camp hes played well for us hopefully its nothing serious and he can get back
6537043 but the pieces are coming back theyre not left they didnt retire you know theyre going to miss some time but theres nothing you can do about that thats part of it we know it theres going to be some good days and some not so good days but youve got to take it for what it is nothing is going to come fast there are going to be times where you scratch your head and say i wish this wouldnt have happened but its how you look at it and i just look at it as hopefully hes going to get back hopefully its not for long and well find out
6537044 any player any player we like to evaluate them when theyre playing and practicing when theyre not there its hard because you dont get that time back even for veteran guys we have some veteran guys who havent practiced in a long time theyre not just going to step on the field and know what to do they think they are but generally they dont play well when they dont practice well get through it thats part of it
6537045 yeah well get a pretty good feel i just think that its a game for us on both sides of the ball were going to play a little bit more into the third quarter i think thats important getting into game shape all of a sudden now coming out of the locker room and playing and participating ive got a feeling that we know most of our guys weve kind of got a feel offensively what they can do defensively i think were still searching at the linebacker position for whats going to be the fit there i think the defensive line we kind of understand the back end the secondary is okay but the linebackers weve got two good players that have been hurt so far so well see where were theyre at in the next week or so
6537046 well what you do is you try to put your best players out on the field the way you do that sometimes is you play nickel bring your nickel guys in the game and if theyre your best players you play nickel thats what you do thats okay too you want to get your best 11 on the field when you can so if we have to do that at times well do it
6537047 well yeah wed like to score when we get into the red zone thats going to be our deal this week especially if we get down there now i dont know what the weathers going to be like i heard its going to rain a lot so well see what happens wed like to score when we get down in the red zone no doubt about it weve been pretty good offensively staying on the field and moving the ball we ran the ball fairly well last week wed like to make some bigger passes in the passing game thatd be great wed like to take the ball away on defense we havent done that yet
6537048 for me 53 in my mind im not saying who those 53 are but its 53 in the end and im okay with the 53 were going to keep
6537049 well i dont know about that we have an idea youre talking now in my opinion its not 53 its 60 because of the practice squad so its 60 in my mind its how do you develop 60 guys out of the guys youre going to keep who is the 53rd guy and then from there who is the eighth guy that makes up 60 to me thats the juggling match the rest of it kind of falls into place its just the numbers how many numbers are you going to keep are you going to keep 11 offensive linemen or 12 thats the number game you play and a lot of it has to do with availability of players if guys are hurt then all of sudden that puts a monkey wrench in the system of what you want to do youve got a pretty good idea of who you think is going to make it youve got a feeling of who you think can play pretty well you feel pretty good about that so now its just a matter of letting them play this week again and getting some guys in there because to me our roster is a little bit different than everyone elses most of our drafted guys are either starting or theyre in a role right now our draft choices play with the first group most of the time so its all about finding the players that can fit the role
6537050 linebackers too you know there are some receivers there you know youre going to keep so many receivers because youve got to keep some on the practice squad too those are the numbers you always juggle

6537073 it cant rely indefinitely on oil and dirty coal as global temperatures and sea levels rise clean alternatives such as solar and wind power are promising but not yet ready to shoulder the lions share of the nations fuel needs consequently nuclear energy has taken on an air of inevitability as the country transitions out of fossil fuels nuclear energy is low in carbon emissions and new reactor designs have the potential to greatly cut the danger of radioactive accidents or misuse

6537146 im endeavouring to get the people in the united states to take back our country and disempower the billionaires and the multinational corporations who are driving our foreign policy our international trade policy and our military policy and wrapping canada into it as well
6537147 they represent the most dangerous aspect of the global elite
6537148 canadians supply a lot of logistical support for our troops in iraq
6537149 in addition of course by taking a major role in afghanistan the canadian military has freed up american soldiers to play cannon fodder in iraq
6537150 though he does not want a war with iran right now and he has a more moderate policy toward the middle east he does want to get rid of russia and china as competitors on the world stage
6537151 so hes going to be playing some dangerous games as well what im calling for is for the united states to return to having a government that follows the constitution honours the truth and serves the people

6537154 there are always some crazy things i get flashed quite often luckily mostly from girls
6537155 i am writing to follow up on recent serious allegations regarding the creation of a false letter from tahir jalil habbush saddam husseins former chief of intelligence to saddam hussein
6537156 the letter which was allegedly backdated to july 1 2001 attempted to establish an operational link between al qaeda and saddam hussein in the period before the 9 11 attacks by specifically stating that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had received training in iraq
6537157 at the time of the alleged decision in 2003 to concoct the false letter the vice presidents office had been reportedly pressuring the cia to prove this connection as a justification to invade iraq
6537158 upon careful review of the allegations concerning this matter i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
6537159 the law specifically provides that no covert action may be conducted which is intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
6537160 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
6537161 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
6537162 i asked chairman conyers to investigate these claims because if true the administration fabricated evidence and used it to lead the country into an unprovoked war
6537163 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
6537164 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
6537165 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
6537166 probably passed through five or six people george tenet probably showed it to me but then passed it probably to jim pavitt the cias deputy director of operations who then passed it down to his chief of staff who passed it to me cause thats how you know so i saw the original i got a copy of it
6537167 my absolute belief that the charges outlined in mr suskinds book regarding agency involvement in forging documents are not true
6537168 during my time as a senior officer i saw many documents from various offices of the white house regarding many topics
6537169 i was also involved in many queries from elements of the administration trying to document an and saddam government link proof of which was never found
6537170 it is important to note however in the transcript just released i make no mention of having received an order to fabricate the letter as claimed by mr suskind in his book i do speak to discussions regarding using habbush which were frequent during that period but what i was talking about was the possibility of using him to tamp down the insurgency not to influence western public opinion
6537171 the fabrication of a letter as claimed by mr suskind would have been much more than a non event
6537172 an order such as the one outlined by mr suskind would have been a huge event and in my opinion illegal an order to fabricate such a document would have been rejected out of hand and it is improbable to believe anyone would write such a request
6537173 the suskind account states that two senior cia officers robert richer and john maguire supervised the preparation of the document under direct orders coming from director george tenet not so says my source
6537174 tenet is for once telling the truth when he states that he would not have undermined himself by preparing such a document while at the same time insisting publicly that there was no connection between saddam and al qaeda
6537175 richer and maguire have both denied that they were involved with the forgery and it should also be noted that preparation of such a document to mislead the media is illegal and they could have wound up in jail
6537176 who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
6537177 the pentagon has its own false documents center primarily used to produce fake papers for delta force and other special ops officers traveling under cover as businessmen
6537178 it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity
6537179 was inappropriately performing intelligence activities of developing producing and disseminating that should be performed by the intelligence community
6537180 the southern border of the so called zone of responsibility crosses the highway in two places near the villages of agara and shaveshebi
6537181 the russians want to set up their so called zone of responsibility near to gori but this is a violation of any agreement
6537182 there will be no buffer zones we will never live with any buffer zones well never allow anything like this

6537204 be aware that this is the first version of the api and were struggling hard to keep it in sync with our feature set while simultaneously planning for the future you can think of it as an alpha api we have much more coming while weve tried to anticipate how when and why you might want to utilize 12seconds we probably definitely havent thought of everything so when the api changes well let you know so that you can keep in step with our growth and advancements
6537205 we have these fake queues at front of 20 stores around the country to drum up interest in the iphone
6537206 the news is positive as mts is promoting 3g networks and this is a toy for advanced users who will become the main consumers of the services which the company is going to offer within these networks
6537207 we need to know on what conditions the companies have reached an agreement whether they are exclusive but it is not such a trigger for the company which will radically influence its results
6537208 no my friends go there so its more fun to have their company no special place just disco clubs i was having really good time met some people i know for example radulov was in the hotel next to mine
6537209 no it was before the scandal but even then radulov were telling he wanted to go to russia and mentioned an offer from salavat yulaev
6537210 i think its obvious salavat has offered him several times more than he could have made in nashville
6537211 right the opposite to leave the best league in the world no thank you
6537212 there are still a lot of barriers for the russians that come over here especially the obvious ones like getting used to the language and getting used to the customs former predators captain greg johnson told glennon
6537213 i always found that the russians were just a different breed i dont know if youd call it pride or what but i found when i was coaching that if you piqued that pride theyd get a little upset i dont think the skins of russians are as thick as other guys

6537217 well a lot of other people have the skill to be a great doctor and yet they decide they dont want to be a doctor anymore stefan felt that he wasnt quite ready to attend training camp next month
6537218 hes a passionate kid i loved him as a player he plays with an edge but he also knows how to play he was intelligent he was very very well liked by his teammates he liked to be the center of attention but in a good way
6537219 that is the larger issue here the demands placed on teenage prospects at the highest level may be doing many of them a disservice
6537220 not everyone wants to be immersed in the sport for the unwavering 24 7 commitment that is demanded these days with summer development camps off season conditioning programs and ice time available year round it is a never ending process seemingly there are no breaks in a sport once rooted in our winter culture but which has now spilled into all four seasons
6537221 being able to buy the way out of an existing contract

6537223 thank you to all of you back home who care what the troops have to say
6537224 we do know that the contemptible armitage failed to come forward and clear the air as his colleagues were smeared for months on end we do know that his boss colin powell sat by as the very character of the administration was corroded
6537225 one california state legislator introduced a bill that would get rid of private health insurance in the golden state altogether wow its fascinating how the people most likely to yammer about the right to privacy and the sanctity of choice are the first to sweep rights aside when a greater good presents itself and theres always a greater good that trumps your personal rights if one looks closely enough
6537226 my problem comes from nimrods who speak with great confidence while pontificating in sophomoric sound bites press these know it alls for details on iraq or answers to the greatest foreign policy crisis in a generation and they mutter something about standing behind the troops or how the president is an idiot all very comforting for political hacks on the right and left but meaningless to the rest of us
6537227 you are of your father the devil and you want to do the desires of your father he was a murderer from the beginning and doesnt stand in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaks a lie he speaks on his own for he is a liar and its father
6537228 considering that a true fix has yet to be issued for users 3g problems this could just be the tip of the iphone lawsuit iceberg
6537229 this is about protecting the right of a physician to practice medicine according to his or her moral compass

6537232 this regulation is not about contraception it is about abortion and conscience

6537235 people who would never drive their car after consuming too much alcohol dont consider those same risks when operating a boat
6537236 weve seen the same tragic consequences on the water as weve seen on the streets
6537237 when boaters anchor on the lake for longer periods theres more time for drinking some boaters are not paying attention to how much alcohol theyve consumed
6537238 if they pull up anchor and drive away drunk thats when they are breaking the law and theyre subject to arrest
6537239 the council of ministers has decided to establish diplomatic relations between lebanon and the syrian arabic republic including setting up an embassy in damascus

6537241 tampoco se detect una preferencia general pero lo que s pas fue que las mujeres que hab an empezado a tomar la p ldora registraron un cambio de preferencia hacia los hombres con un mhc similar al suyo

6537249 its a frickin mansion he doesnt tell people that you have a mansion you bought in a shady deal with a convicted felon
6537250 you are going to see more of that now that this issue has been joined youll see more of the rezko matter from us
6537251 two years ago obama bought a mansion on the south side in the kenwood neighborhood from a doctor on the same day antoin tony rezkos wife rita rezko bought the vacant lot next door from the same seller the doctor had listed the properties for sale together he sold the house to obama for 300 000 below the asking price the doctor got his asking price on the lot from rezkos wife
6537252 on the same day obama closed on his house rezkos wife bought the adjacent empty lot meeting the condition of the seller who wanted to sell both properties at the same time

6537254 i always liked libraries but when i left school i couldnt decide what i wanted to do i chose to do a double degree so i wouldnt have to make too many decisions
6537255 we made the decision to move to yass because we were sick of living in sydney it was a conscious decision
6537256 belonging to a community and being apart of a community were really important to us
6537257 we are building a home on acreage we would never have had the opportunity to do that in sydney
6537258 the clientele is a lot broader i work with people from six months of age to im not going to say how old
6537259 the age range is very different and the needs are very different it is really rewarding to come out of my office and see so many different groups from the community using the public spaces of the library
6537260 my background has really helped me with baby rhyme time and story time i can also understand what teachers require from the students who use the library to do their homework
6537261 i try to use my love of literacy and early learning through the story sessions
6537262 i love that we have the books for babies program at the library it is important to highlight the importance of literacy in the early stages of a childs life
6537263 i would always welcome suggestions from the community about cross promotional activities
6537264 i think it is very important that the library is a common hub and a safe place for people to come
6537265 weve had a huge increase in the usage and the number of people coming through the doors
6537266 to think the library used to be a little room outside the front of the yass memorial hall and now even with more extensions we still seem to be outgrowing the space
6537267 the yass library has always been considered a well used library but of course i would like to see it used more
6537268 it is amazing what resources a country library can have we have access to 100 000 items and there really is no need for people to travel
6537269 people dont realise what treasures exist in their local libraries they might think they only have access to what is on the shelf but there is so much more
6537270 we have our regulars they miss you when youre on holidays and you build up a relationship with them sometimes you play a very important part in their day to day life and you need to appreciate that
6537271 ive seen many kids grow up over the years they have grown up with me and with the library
6537272 i love childrens literature there is so much more than what meets the eye a childrens author tends to get away with far more than an adult author ever could
6537273 i can pick up anything and read anything but my real love is childrens literature
6537274 distances are only the relation of space to time and vary with it we express the difficulty that we have in getting to a place in a system of miles or kilometers which becomes false as soon as that difficulty decreases
6537275 art is modified by it also since a village which seemed to be in a different world from some other village becomes its neighbor in a landscape whose dimensions are altered
6537276 attending a polling place is a different environment from the theatre the cinema or performance spaces where the community has a choice regarding the material they view or read
6537277 electoral material must meet the broadest community expectations of not causing offence to the broadest range of people in the community from very young adults to older citizens of different views beliefs and perspectives
6537278 the 527s and the independent groups can say things that the candidates cant
6537279 theyre going to have some role this year but the role is unknown we wont really be able to evaluate it until after the election
6537280 groups in 04 waited until the fall to ramp up their spending
6537281 there wont be a lot of good information until its already too late
6537282 if people want to support our campaign they should do it through our campaign
6537283 mccain would prefer that people give money to him and the rnc republican national committee and let us run our own campaign
6537284 and if these groups are useful they will not repudiate them
6537285 well funded 527s might be prepared to just push ahead and pay a fine
6537286 obviously its got nothing to do with boosting the campaign of either candidate
6537287 i can see it the future being very rosy for transborder express
6537288 id like to think weve looked after our passengers well over the past 50 years but now weve handed over to a larger service at the end of the day its a great thing for everybody
6537289 we now have the opportunity to extend our service to regional areas which can only benefit the people of yass
6537290 were well versed in law enforcement operations conducting boardings is like second nature to us queries escorts we can do all that i definitely think were needed i was out here four years ago doing boardings in the same arabian gulf
6537291 from what ive seen i think its gone pretty well the foreign nationals ive spoken to here on base they seem very very happy for us to be here we have the iraqi air force here that were training theyre very very receptive i really do think its going great i wouldnt recommend pulling out there have been people more than i can count that have lost their lives in support of this war if we just give up and pull out then those lives have been lost in vain this place would go to ruin if we were to pull out now theyre starting to set up their own government theyre not even on their own feet yet if we were to take out all of our support it would go to shambles
6537292 theres got to be more journalistic responsibility to report the positive things going on we have tvs on around us all the time where i work a lot of guys share the feeling i have theres not enough focus on the positive happening out here
6537293 you have to accept that the revolution happened and it changed cuba objectively thats where you have to start from
6537294 a sweeping law recognizing all current residents of property as the uncontested owners such a law he argues is the only way to guarantee stability and avoid legal battles that could tear the island apart
6537295 i did get to work with iraqi recruits who were trying out for the special forces and the motivation was overwhelming it showed me that they are very determined to do whatever they can to do right by their country

6537298 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6537299 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6537300 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

6537318 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6537319 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6537320 t he short answer to the short question posed by my short title bereft of postcolonial discourse since it has no colon is no humanists cannot talk to postmodernists this might seem paradoxical at first since people who consider themselves humanists do in fact talk to people who consider themselves postmodernists every day they meet for example in faculty dining rooms and on payroll lines and they discuss for example whether the cafeteria chili should be avoided or whether their health plans cover anti depressants
6537321 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6537322 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6537323 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6537324 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6537325 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6537326 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6537327 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6537328 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6537329 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas

6537331 es geht jetzt darum den t ter dingfest zu machen und zur verantwortung zu ziehen
6537332 wir m chten kein t terwissen bekanntgeben so lange er frei heruml uft
6537333 ohne eine intervention der uno k nnen wir nichts machen weil somalia keine zentralregierung hat
6537334 if the best defense is a good offense then i am more than willing to offend my enemies
6537335 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6537336 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6537337 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6537338 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6537339 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6537340 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6537341 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6537342 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6537343 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6537344 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6537345 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6537346 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6537347 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6537348 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6537349 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6537350 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6537351 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6537352 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6537353 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6537354 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6537355 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6537356 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6537357 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6537358 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6537359 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6537360 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6537361 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6537362 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6537363 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6537364 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6537365 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6537366 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6537367 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6537368 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6537369 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie

6537371 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

6537375 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6537376 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6537377 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6537378 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6537379 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6537380 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6537381 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6537382 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6537383 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6537384 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6537385 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6537386 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6537387 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6537388 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6537389 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6537390 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6537391 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6537392 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6537393 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6537394 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6537395 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6537396 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6537397 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6537398 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6537399 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6537400 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6537401 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6537402 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6537403 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6537404 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6537405 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6537406 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6537407 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6537408 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6537409 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6537410 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6537411 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6537412 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

6537415 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6537416 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6537417 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente

6537421 i represent the u s a and this is the only uniform ill ever put on i had no idea i was going to make this team i was on the bubble i was one of the last three players named if i made it wonderful if i didnt id cheer for my country to win a gold medal
6537422 to me its no different from australian tom maher coaching china my teammates disagree theyre not the first people to do it it has been done for years its nothing that i would do

6537435 pero lo m s doloroso es que la orden de su asesinato fue impartida por jos stalin jefe de la burocracia sovi tica quien hab a usurpado el poder a la clase obrera sovi tica asesinado perseguido y exiliado a millones de revolucionarios que se opusieron tenazmente a su criminal pol tica de conciliaci n de clases y de acuerdos con el imperialismo
6537436 a 68 a os del asesinato de le n trotsky la vigencia de su pensamiento y su obra tiene plena vigencia la reesturaci n del capitalismo en la extinta urss en los pa ses del este europeo y en china con sus p rfidas secuelas de mafias y sometimiento a millones de trabajadores a un r gimen semi esclavista nos deben comprometer a luchar con m s decisi n para avanzar hacia el socialismo eliminando la explotaci n del hombre por el hombre denunciando las capitulaciones al imperialismo las multinacionales la burgues a y los terratenientes y desarrollando una batalla sin tregua contra la burocracia

6537440 it was always going to be an optimistic programme but we were confident we could achieve it this in no way reflects on the work undertaken by the technical team and our partners as it was due to circumstances beyond their control i also want to thank all our technical partners for their support during our intensive testing programme and especially ferrari for the supply of engines
6537441 we now have to concentrate on what we have ahead of us rather than behind we still have some great announcements to make in the near future we shall be able to announce our full race calendar as well as some deals that will enhance the overall package we are presenting to our fans for season four
6537442 and its nice to see gaming center stage like this but
6537443 there will be no more flowers sent my loved ones are getting giant fortune cookies from now on
6537444 with photoshop elements im able to capture memories that are very special to me in my life and create beautiful works of art
6537445 if there was something we thought could enhance our team for the future and help us in some areas that we felt we had some serious needs then fine so be it we would entertain it that never happened
6537446 it goes back to doing the right thing at the right time
6537447 weve never benefited from doing the short term move weve always benefited from making moves with long term vision and weve stayed with that for a number of years
6537448 obviously we wouldnt have been as good a team and we wouldnt have had the same potential going forward it also would have changed the culture
6537449 we were happy that everyone stayed here we have a pretty good team and hopefully with the way weve been playing lately we can keep it going
6537450 my mom just roots for whichever one plays the best
6537451 to come up with the bases loaded and two outs and be the guy
6537452 every day he comes out even when hes not playing you see him sitting on the bench staring at the field he doesnt walk around he doesnt go in the clubhouse he pays attention when he goes out there you will see he more than anybody on this team with a runner at second base and nobody out gets him over consistently he knows what to do and how to do it
6537453 hes a professional baseball player he goes out there and does all the little things right
6537454 he just goes about his business and goes out there and does his job
6537455 willys a baseball player every day he comes out even when hes not playing you see him sitting on the bench staring at the field
6537456 i didnt know he was this good of a defender
6537457 and thank god its not something i have to focus on anymore
6537458 i just think that when youre in a good environment around good guys everything just tends to form in the right way
6537459 he just seems comfortable he seems relaxed and when you have that combination it makes you go out there and be yourself and play your game
6537460 all of our guys have played and theyve been participating all year when theyre out there they feel comfortable about it they feel like they belong they feel like theyre part of something special and that brings out the best in all of our guys
6537461 its a great honor for me obviously the biggest game of my career
6537462 im very confident im just going to go out there and do what ive been doing all year im not going to change in any way if they hit me ill tip my cap to them
6537463 hes pitched a whole lot of international play this year and i wanted to give him more rest its that simple
6537464 hes had a very successful college year and then pitched for usa baseball right to this point
6537465 i plan to pitch him against cuba were not worried about his makeup
6537466 any time you have one of the worlds best teams going against you its something you get up for now i have a chance against cuba its a win win situation for me im excited just to go out there against the best competition its great for me to have a couple of extra days rest especially at this stage of the year
6537467 hes got good stuff thats why he showed he can compete against this level
6537468 hes going to pitch his game hes stephen strasburg he is who he is hes gonna come in and challenge these guys and throw his game
6537469 thats it for me do that move my fastball inside and out set up the slider
6537470 the rivalry between cuba and usa is close to my heart
6537471 this is a big ball game i think that these are two teams with great quality i think the united states is very good offensively with good pitchers and good team speed
6537472 all the baseball players here are a lot farther down the road
6537473 but we can all relate once were in the dugout its something you never get a chance to do
6537474 i dont think the pressure of the medal round will make much difference he has his game plan and it is about executing it you are talking about a guy who has overpowering stuff at times so it would be interesting to see if cuba will be able to adjust to him
6537475 that feels good im from san diego so the whole community there is really taking interest im thankful for my coaches back there everyone
6537476 we are proud to extend our affiliation with the angels
6537477 theyve been a great partner over the past eight years and have provided our fans with some memorable moments its also been great to watch so many of our former players find success in the big leagues
6537478 the sport is getting closer and closer to being drug free theres no one person who is guaranteed to win pressed she says this is a reference to
6537479 but in my opinion when it comes to the relays there is not so much gelling these words will soon be prophetic
6537480 it would be ungrateful for me to say im disappointed with a silver medal when so many people dont even get the opportunity
6537481 i dont think i can be thrilled because my expectations were so high but i cant be ungrateful
6537482 shes been looking forward to this for four years he says
6537483 and shes had a lot of success along the way but right now shes disappointed its not easy
6537484 i think i felt it hitting my hand says gay
6537485 i didnt feel it all the way in my hand ill take the blame they got the stick around to me and i let them down
6537486 thats tyson gay very humble guy its my job as the incoming runner to get the stick to the next guy
6537487 people want to assess blame to me thats okay ill take it williams says
6537488 my hand was there the stick was there the stick had a mind of its down it wasnt my fault it wasnt torris fault maybe the stick had a little bug in there and it jumped out
6537489 those last 50 meters hurt he will tell me later merritt rolls past him and through the line in a brilliant personal best of 43 75 seconds which knocks 21 seconds from merritts pr and makes him the fifth fastest 400 meter runner in history
6537490 other athletes are just running fast yall cant say were not competing to our best
6537491 some people think my career is over or my domination is over this was just one championship one race next year there is a world championship and theres another olympics in four years
6537492 weve now got barrett and dichio who is on the road to getting healthier and this will also help bring young ibee ibrahim along properly were very excited to get ruiz in here he holds the ball up well and is a clinical finisher
6537493 we have got every reason to be confident that a government that is committed to its own policy the government has the mandate of the australian people will in fact take legislation that reflects that to the parliament
6537494 the real challenge will be will the liberal coalition actually support it
6537495 im delighted to be involved with iron chef america supreme cuisine
6537496 my video game counterpart is as passionate and competitive in the virtual kitchen stadium as i am in real life and i think the participation of chef morimoto and i adds a great level of authenticity to the game
6537497 having been an iron chef in both japan and america i am pleased to partake in another exciting frontier video games hopefully iron chef supreme cuisine can inspire a new generation of great chefs
6537498 work was supposed to have started before the end of the year and we wont even be close to seeing a bidder selected the way things have been going

6537512 our goal for the chevrolet cruze is to lead in fuel economy in this very competitive car segment
6537513 these are the things we must go back and work on
6537514 the players know that work has to be done to improve their strike rate etc etc
6537515 i think setting an artificial timetable for withdrawal is a significant mistake it is it sends mixed signals and bad signals to the region and to the iraqi citizens listen the iraqis are wondering whether or not were going to stay to help people in america wonder whether or not theyve got the political will to do the hard work
6537516 and if the congress wants to test my will as to whether or not ill accept the timetable for withdrawal i wont accept one i just dont think its in the interest of our troops i think it im just envisioning what it would be like to be a young soldier in the middle of iraq and realizing that politicians have all of a sudden made military determinations and in my judgment that would put a kid in harms way more so than he or she already is
6537517 the prime minister says what iraq and her people now need is time not a timetable they seek our patience not political posturing they require resolve not our retreat were going to succeed in iraq if given a chance liberty will succeed every time and liberty will help yield the peace we need
6537518 theres a temptation to let the politics at home get in the way with the considered judgment of the commanders thats why i strongly rejected an artificial timetable of withdrawal its kind of like an arbitrary thing you know we will decide in the halls of congress how to conduct our affairs in iraq based upon polls and politics and were going to impose this on people as opposed to listening to our commanders and our diplomats and listening to the iraqis for that matter
6537519 in the area of security cooperation the president and the prime minister agreed that improving conditions should allow for the agreements now under negotiation to include a general time horizon for meeting aspirational goals

6537527 islington councils trading standards are aware of sos master tickets and are in the process of carrying out an investigation into their activity
6537528 so far there have been more than 300 complaints to the national consumer direct helpline
6537529 we alerted the authorities to this some months ago because the prices they were offering for tickets were simply not achievable
6537530 they were offering a weekends camping at these festivals for 200 pounds that is not a realistic figure

6537534 the sultan who inherited the riches of an unbroken 600 year old muslim dynasty has had to cut back on his countrys oil production because of depleting reserves
6537535 there will be further consequences to russias action theres no doubt about it
6537536 but russia has already i think begun to suffer some of the consequences of their actions and their continued reluctance to adhere to the withdrawal plan only further isolates them
6537537 i think the for all practical purposes military to military cooperation had really already been suspended with the russians we nato canceled some exercises and i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6537538 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6537539 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
6537540 its one big step forward in improving the safety of fresh produce
6537541 its expensive and it doesnt really address the problem at the source
6537542 even with that we really wanted them to get paid its just there is a lot of processing involved there is a lot of paperwork there are a lot of transactions that have to be downloaded into the system

6537561 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6537562 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6537563 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6537564 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6537565 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6537566 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6537567 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6537568 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6537569 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6537570 he is someone who purports to campaign as a man of the people but who resides in a whole series of wealthy million dollar chateaus and mansions
6537571 its just one more contradiction and example of him being out of the mainstream with america

6537573 we see walls being built what is the u s afraid of
6537574 i sat on an old rush chair id pulled up against the far wall turned the lamp down then blew across its chimney to put out the flame i wondered if somehow all the things that had come our way that summer were not real but some terrible long nightmare that id soon waken from feeling rattled but all would be right again or was it instead all part and parcel of some plan by the almighty to wear me to the bone or see if id either give up or dig in ive had ups and downs tribulation of one sort or another just like any woman this time ive been given a stony cliff to climb
6537575 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6537576 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6537577 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6537578 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6537579 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6537580 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6537581 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6537582 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6537583 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6537584 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6537585 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6537586 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6537587 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6537588 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6537589 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6537590 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6537591 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6537592 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6537593 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6537594 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6537595 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6537596 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6537597 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6537598 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6537599 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6537600 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6537601 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6537602 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6537603 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6537604 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6537605 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6537606 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6537607 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6537608 the federal government has been using its system of border checkpoints to greatly expand a database on travelers entering the country by collecting information on all u s citizens crossing by land compiling data that will be stored for 15 years and may be used in criminal and intelligence investigations
6537609 part of a broader effort to guard against terrorist threats
6537610 unprecedented expansion of data gathering for national security and intelligence purposes
6537611 even though market conditions have definitely become more difficult the past year we are happy to see that many professional services organizations and agencies are looking at this as an opportunity to strengthen their internal systems and procedures and invest in business solutions like maconomy
6537612 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6537613 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6537614 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6537615 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6537616 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6537617 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6537618 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6537619 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6537620 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6537621 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6537622 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6537623 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6537624 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6537625 the former president says hes ready should his wife be elected to the white house for role reversal
6537626 bill clinton charmed the crowds in south africa this week showing the diplomatic skills he could put to use if his wife becomes americas first female president
6537627 i dont know what arkansan is for chutzpah but this is a gigantic case of it
6537628 senate blocks a measure as democrats fail to get needed votes
6537629 senate minority leader mitch mc connel r ky said the program is costing 265 billion less than anticipated
6537630 this will be a major issue in the next election elections have consequences this issue isnt going away
6537631 climate change other than the war in iraq is the most important thing we can work on
6537632 the real issue is whether were going to agree to a surrender date and thats not going to happen
6537633 jai plus darguments alors je vais essayer de te blaster sur ton francais
6537634 as weve become aware of the severity of the problem weve taken action to arrange short term measures and to investigate the possible long term solution
6537635 we need a spirituality that embraces and embodies the insights of the great founders of religion but then we created dogma and ideology we made it divisive and went to war we need to rely on something more than just belief
6537636 god has managed the amazing feat of being worshiped and invisible at the same time the aim of spirituality is to learn to cooperate with god most of us learned to do the opposite
6537637 g o d the generator the organizer and the deliverer of the universe we tend to project how we think of ourselves onto divinity so divinity being infinite unbounded eternal beyond space and time is not a he or a she its a field of intelligence
6537638 while beliefs vary from place to place faith is essentially the same
6537639 while beliefs vary from place to place faith is essentially the same
6537640 typically its the undecided voter that gives politicians a hard time its the undecided voters that you need to get
6537641 this study shows that by using these measures there is some potential for improving the prediction of election outcomes
6537642 the inspiration for this study came from the development of a particular class of measures that enables us to assess these automatic mental associations
6537643 over the past couple of years a lot of research has shown that these measures are able to predict behaviors that psychologists have had a hard time predicting with standard methodology or self report
6537644 this type of measure in the domain of prejudice and stereotyping has found that in north america there is a large proportion of individuals with relatively negative views of african americans even people who hold very strong egalitarian opinions or beliefs sometimes show negative associations
6537645 this can influence their voting behavior particularly for undecided voters in a way that they may not be aware of
6537646 its not uncommon for me to stay up until 2 or 3 in the morning watch the game we just played watch the team were going to play prepare a practice then go to work the next morning
6537647 the new investment arrangement with lupin will greatly contribute to our longer term market share ambitions though its equity investment will result in no change in the day to day operations of generic health
6537648 we want to bridge the gap between the paid up capital of rs 145 crore and authorised capital of rs 1 500 crore along with some soft loans however this will not be a bailout package as its being described
6537649 based on certain parameters a judicious decision will be taken
6537650 fares have gone up due to increase in jet fuel prices we are cutting costs but the real thing will be fall in fuel prices
6537651 it is a loss for the union government as well since the paddy is mainly grown for the national food basket our farmers had put in all inputs except the harvesting process they should be getting at least rs 15 000 per acre for their losses
6537652 unexpected abnormal rains and increased flow of water from himachal pradesh even the dams overflowed
6537653 i had checked up from the army also they said when the water was overflowing at such a great speed it was not possible to carry out any work
6537654 currently bafl is present in around 150 dealerships our plan is to spread this to 250 in the next eight months and gradually to our entire network in the next few years
6537655 with the thrust on its expansion bafls share in our overall sales is likely to rise substantially
6537656 if the customer profile is good and he offers a good down payment interest rates could be offered at lower and fair rates though this will not be the norm
6537657 the idea is to increase finance penetration and make it available to all eligible customers also with our finance network we can focus more intimately with our prospective customers and build relationships with them
6537658 we plan to offer things like extended warranty packages through the bafl route and the finance offer can also club insurance schemes within them
6537659 i have this form here and i want to be sure im not missing anything it says the date on my tax form was missing
6537660 yes thats right just put in todays date and send it back in the return envelope
6537661 you sent me four sheets of paper for this isnt this a waste of taxpayers dollars
6537662 i cant comment on that maam but if you just send back the envelope with the information well be all set
6537663 biasanya bulan kesembilan sudah hujan maka sebelum bulan itu gorong gorong harus sudah selesai supaya air dapat mengalir dari selatan ke utara tol menuju sawah saya
6537664 saya telah memberi masukan kepada pemerintah pusat agar membangun saluran air dengan benar kalau tidak akan terjadi banjir atau kekeringan karena air tak mengalir atau terserap
6537665 kalau ada tol mungkin orang jadi jarang mampir penjualan pasti turun
6537666 di dekat junction persimpangan jalan tol kami bangun perbelanjaan atau perumahan lalu kami juga mengonservasi lahan hijau yang bisa dijadikan lokasi wisata
6537667 tidak dapat dihindari perubahan tata ruang tetapi akan kami kelola supaya masyarakat tidak dimarjinalkan kami akan kerja sama dengan universitas gadjah mada dan universitas diponegoro untuk meneliti dampaknya masyarakat sekitar jelas akan dipekerjakan

6537670 kids reject the bad taste of medicine because its basic biology their system is designed to reject that taste because many toxic substances are bitter and distasteful
6537671 our basic biology is telling us to reject bitter that its poison were really designed to reject this stuff
6537672 when it comes to many of the senses childhood is a time of heightened sensitivity the preference for sweet and salt starts shifting in adolescence
6537673 i would caution those who make medicines not to make them so palatable that kids think theyre candy
6537674 my favorite trick is chocolate syrup before and after the medicine
6537675 a lot of times children refuse a food and parents give in and dont offer it again but parents need to persevere and offer the foods again repeated exposure may help

6537680 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6537681 mr ayers is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something that i deplore 40 years ago when i was 6 or 7 years old
6537682 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6537683 when the american public fully understands the close continuing relationship between their potential president and a remorseless domestic terrorist we believe it will send a chill down their spines
6537684 lots of shows not just news are recording all time lows because of the continued fragmentation of viewing choices and in some cases due to dvr time shifting
6537685 lots of shows not just news are recording all time lows because of the continued fragmentation of viewing choices and in some cases due to dvr time shifting
6537686 got so fed up with his attitude that they locked him in a cupboard under the stairs and all went to the local pub for a pint or two
6537687 this is going to be another high quality piece for us
6537688 this is going to be another high quality piece for us
6537689 the us price comes with a two year airtime contract so it is not fair to compare these rates we are selling these phones to enhance customer experience not to make a profit
6537690 the average age range is 45 to 55 with some as young as late 30s and some as senior as 65 to 70 plus
6537691 some matches have resulted in women becoming incredible friends and travel partners nice for single women as well as for those who have been widowed and are hesitant to travel alone
6537692 every year we experience importation of measles from other countries and from those going abroad but this year is different once measles is imported here were seeing it spread to many more people
6537693 many cases are in children who are eligible for vaccination but who have not been immunized because of parents decisions
6537694 we need very high levels of population immunity approximately 95 percent
6537695 why dont you sell it for 1 99 lb like the other guy
6537696 lady when im out mine is 1 99 lb too
6537697 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession
6537698 the decline in the leading index should therefore not be interpreted as a sign the outlook is quickly deteriorating
6537699 thats critical while consumers may be cautious and conservative in their spending as long as the rate does not spike there should be enough income growth to keep the economy muddling along
6537700 could then be easily used by a file system task to copy move or delete a file perhaps
6537701 its sending a very clear message out to sex abusers and potential sex abusers that they are no longer going to be able to get away with hopping from one southeast asian country to the next in the hope of having easy access to children and impunity from justice
6537702 he complained that he was sick and he needed a doctor
6537703 i want to put it all behind me and live my life
6537704 when they fine these people or put them in prison nothing is ever said about who takes care of the kids
6537705 we are utterly resolute in our determination to support this new democracy in afghanistan
6537706 i accept that pakistan and the problem of terrorism there and coming from there is something thats got to be raised with the pakistan government
6537707 your indication that youre willing to put a person who has a clear unequivocal pro abortion record within a heartbeat of the presidency is alarming
6537708 senator mccain you are exceedingly proud of being a political maverick you wear it as a badge of honor well poke the base of the republican party the conservatives in the eye one more time by choosing a pro abortion vice presidential candidate and conservatives will show you that two can play the maverick game
6537709 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats the best that i can tell you
6537710 can nominate or try and nominate anyone he wants he is in fact the leader of the party now going forward but it would be a very bumpy road
6537711 main criteria would be a person that would allow us to sleep at night knowing that we had selected someone that could immediately be president of the united states
6537712 he will select the person that is best and if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6537713 we arrived three minutes late and they let us check in but we did not make it we ended up trying to find a new flight then we discovered the plane we would have been on had crashed
6537714 we have to fly to the canary islands were from there and that about sums it up
6537715 were stranded here until we catch a flight lets see if were lucky
6537716 you are not going to believe it but we are going to fly again with spanair
6537717 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6537718 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6537719 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6537720 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time
6537721 our music now is not representing the times at least not socially and politically or maybe were just distracted
6537722 these musicians speak to millions of people every day so for them to use their voices to inspire people is a key part of our program
6537723 we just saw jamaicas usain bolt set the world record in the 200 meter dash and the first thing that came to mind was this how fast would he be if he hadnt spent much of his life breathing second hand marijuana smoke
6537724 among the arguments put forward for renaming azcarraga was that
6537725 which hasnt been officially announced it will be released in 2010
6537726 what happened to the people that had this job before me
6537727 hay argumentos plausibles en el criterio del gobierno del estado y la legislatura

6537729 some people are wealthy and rich in their lives and their children and their ability to educate them others are poor if theyre billionaires
6537730 shouted at them cursed them and eventually slammed the phone down on them it was ridiculously immature behavior

6537732 can have their say about identity issues in the uk
6537733 i think its pretty disingenuous of the government to come out and say
6537734 so far the stats look like 100 say no to id cards time to lose these results in a train station
6537735 thought id reupload this piece of propaganda on behalf of jacqui smith but with the option to post comments and rate on you know seeing as the videos meant to be promoting discussion and everything
6537736 we would also be concerned for the safety of students personal information if they were forced to enter the id card system
6537737 by the end of the 22nd we will pull back to the checkpoints line
6537738 first his troops are going to be out on monday then his troops were going to be out on wednesday now his troops are going to be out on friday
6537739 im beginning to wonder if the russian president is ever going to keep his word or can he keep his word or whats going on there
6537740 i wouldnt have left a finnish major who was a military observer there so of course we didnt know but you know as ive said theres no point in escalating the war of words in this the osce is an international organization which is serious about its military monitoring and tries to help everyone for a permanent cease fire
6537741 lets just put all the energy that we have into trying to maintain the cease fire get the humanitarian aid there get people back into their homes and start real peace negotiations
6537742 all of this rubbish screaming and shouting left and right does no good for anyone
6537743 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
6537744 so basically i had prophylactic double mastectomies people would say three weeks ago i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me and so this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
6537745 se trat de un individuo que dirigi su agresi n hacia otro no a la escuela ni a los estudiantes dentro de la escuela
6537746 el recibi un disparo y empez a caminar y se estaba tocando el pecho
6537747 it was pretty tough out there in the wind whilst we got some rain early on and that always makes it uncomfortable
6537748 the good thing is that a two under par 68 is probably the worst score i could have shot today and if it had not been for a couple of three putts i could have easily finished at four under
6537749 but ive got no real complaints and it was another day for being patient and im pleased i managed to do that
6537750 i still need to work on my putting and thats why i am heading to the practice putting green so hopefully this round will be my poor round for the week

6537771 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6537772 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6537773 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6537774 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6537775 suge knight came in once and i got really scared
6537776 i think i made someone else move it i didnt want to be laid out
6537777 i come from a moral background and i can see the power of the show and imagine my old school teachers cringing or my grandparents thinking oh my god when they see me say having sex on a barstool
6537778 but you have to remember this is not a reality show its supposed to be pure entertainment
6537779 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6537780 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6537781 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6537782 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6537783 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6537784 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6537785 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6537786 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6537787 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6537788 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6537789 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6537790 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6537791 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6537792 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6537793 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6537796 he didnt even take the time to think this through therefore he must really not love me
6537797 proposition that guards of the same sex serve as mentors or role models for the prisoners
6537798 because it is based on folk wisdom it could in principle be based on facts such as proof that recidivism rates fall or legitimate income after release rises when a prison has more guards of the inmates sex but the county conceded that it lacked such data when it adopted this policy and neither expert witnesses nor any published studies supplied an empirical foundation for the policy at trial
6537799 why then should courts accept the same sort of justification for sex discrimination
6537800 the time has passed when cheap talk and unverifiable assertions of professional experience may substitute for the kind of evidence
6537801 too often we underestimate the power of a touch a smile a kind word a listening ear an honest compliment or the smallest act of caring all of which have the potential to turn a life around
6537802 there are two big forces at work external and internal

6537878 has already begun meetings with numerous stakeholders to gather community input for the design

6537933 sponges have one of the most ancient lineages and dont have nerve cells
6537934 so we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form
6537935 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
6537936 what we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves or what may be called the nerves ancestor the proto neuron
6537937 we found sets of these genes in sponges when we really didnt expect it
6537938 the significance of our study is that it identifies smurf1 as the signaling partner through which tnf does damage in ra related bone loss
6537939 that has enabled researchers to begin designing small molecule drugs to shut down the action of smurf 1 and its relatives furthermore since mice engineered to have less smurf1 expression develop thicker bones future drugs that shut down smurf1 may be also useful against more common forms of osteoporosis simply by changing the dose of course this is early stage work with many obstacles ahead but it is exciting nonetheless

6537944 the system proposed for poland and the czech republic doesnt exist has never been tested and has no demonstrated effectiveness to defend europe or the u s under realistic operational conditions
6537945 for these reasons the u s bmd system proposed for europe is causing strife with russia for nothing
6537946 it can never work and everybody knows it but it makes russia mad
6537947 if the ground based mid course system proposed for poland were effective against missiles launched from iran then it would also be effective against russian missiles launched towards the u s this is something which russia cannot accept
6537948 iran is not reckless enough to attack europe and neither is north korea
6537949 okay so this missile defense is useless then why is russia getting upset
6537950 bang on things when you see colors on the screen
6537951 being barraged by a constant stream of negative information is one of the things that creates worry
6537952 its hard to understand what applies to you and what doesnt
6537953 they put off opening their bills or pay just the minimum each month
6537954 they become erratic cutting back on trivial things then turning around and making huge purchases
6537955 in an effort to save money panicked people will unnecessarily cut things they actually need like insurance
6537956 when worry leads to denial it really means that you feel stuck and alone
6537957 ask what they can do for you like setting up a payment plan
6537958 once you face your money fears youre often able to turn a difficult situation around
6537959 try keeping a pen and pad of paper next to your bed
6537960 before you go to sleep jot down your five biggest money worries and resolve to begin acting on them in the morning
6537961 people may cut back on buying expensive sandwiches for lunch for instance and then turn around and purchase a pricey pair of shoes
6537962 you have to be able to accept limitations and say no sometimes to the things you want
6537963 take a hard look at it and be honest with yourself
6537964 the truck left wednesday morning for bristol and we left at the crack of dawn for a test at iowa
6537965 were doing it in two different trips going to iowa to test and then coming back and leaving for bristol on thursday morning
6537966 certainly for us and all teams out of the top 35 its qualifying on friday
6537967 thats our main focus because you cant really concentrate on race trim until you actually make the race bristol anything can happen and it can happen real quick we just have to be prepared get in the show and then focus on the race
6537968 fridays wear on you the stress of trying to qualify into the races but other than that you always try to go out and win and do the best job you possibly can it doesnt really wear you out on race day its more the anxiety of friday trying to make the race

6537975 as far as nato and isaf natos international security assistance force isaf are concerned the allegations in le monde are completely unfounded
6537976 we deny the report we have no information whatsoever that would indicate that the french soldiers were killed by nato planes
6537977 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or wounded were consistent with air delivered ordnance
6537978 we know that the planes supplying what we call close air support could not engage because the french troops were very close to the taliban insurgents
6537979 if they had engaged there might have been considerable collateral damage if bombs had been used
6537980 no french soldier at any time during the incident came on the radio to say that they were taking friendly fire and no french soldier after the event has mentioned to the chain of command that this might have been the case
6537981 there was fire from machine guns on american planes that were guided by american special forces and we have no information that enables us to consider that the french soldiers were killed under fire from nato planes

6537986 in all topics mr obama displays a similar worried serious looking facial pattern even when talking about more positive subjects his facial expressions do not signal positive affective states
6537987 there is an element of the fact that he is on the edges of his comfort zone here
6537988 going into a presidential campaign is not something he has done before and you could say it is written all over his face
6537989 the dominating attitude as transmitted by his vocal style is that of concern and sincere involvement
6537990 his smile is often not fully developed ie his cheek raising muscles do not participate enough in the expression of positive affect to be perceived as genuine

6538010 the murderburgers bitches blunts and pop punk i fuckin love this cd unaffected highly accelerated pop punk played just perfectly by a 3 piece who climb to the top of my bands to see list with ease everything pop punk should be is rattled out here short melodic and most importantly fun another great accolade for label dont give up the day job records with this exceptional band producing a 21 hit classic we are the murderburgers opens in fine style makes the titled statement and prepares the listener for the superb ive got a plan to kill you a truly great song ripping in with the 1 8 count and breezing along on crisp melody and enjoyable vibes pounding in my head has me pondering similar songs but placing a name to them in my tumultuous grey matter is another thing indeed brians got an asbo is a brilliant basic burst and effervesces with tongue tying lyrics before booming into the delightful full on chorus dont piss me off tonight tends towards the more sonic flowing side of things with the excellent everythings alright another prozac piece in a bottleful of promising pills at this point the impression made is mighty but the next 4 songs are for me choice epics and ones that will put this band in good stead for the rest of their musical careers phantom maggot if im an arsehole so are you braindead from hanging around with you and outta my mind are where every facet of this bands talent combines to create a quartet of purely outstanding tunes that compliment one another ideally and are of such an individual stature they are worthy of a position on any compilation alongside any other great tunes phantom maggot will surely be one of the best songs i hear this year even though it is a cover originally hammered out by the lillingtons a band i have yet to grace my hears with classic stuff moving on from the momentous cd high we wind down with still another 11 tracks of crackin standard in fact this 21 track cd is so good all the way through even this is not enough and i craved yet more infectious tunage to bombard my pop and pogo brain with the highs of the turn for home are many and i honestly cant find a lull in the quality but the truly awesome moments are the brilliantly delivered retarded girl the comic book x ray specs another lillingtons cover must check these buggers out the typical yet effective punk nastiness of fuck you the crazed ear bashing of lazy piece of shit and the boozing bop of drink to get drunk its a great close down but the exceptional my babys too far gone is a monstrous finale and again the question needs to be asked of how many better songs will i hear this year despite being another behemoth ditty it also i feel gives an insight into the murderburgers ability to write songs with a deeper texture amid an ambience with more emotive vocals and cultured guitar a classic end note and i hope a taster of what is to come on future recordings there is such a downpour of brilliant musical offerings on the market today and i am lucky to be given the chance to review a small segment of this talent soaked scene but even i on occasions like this am truly grateful and privileged to come across and praise something so special this is a music fans dream moment as all the watching and listening to bands finally results in the discovery of something so wonderfully enjoyable as my initial thoughts stated and with each and every listen become more and more accurate i fuckin love this cd

6538031 she cant quite yet understand it conventional has gone astray but her conviction to this part she has landed wont contradict her now that its the day consciously she knows its a bit candid cautiously she walks onto the stage conversing into the mic she was handed but he made her forget what to say amidst the crowd he seemed to be screaming yet remaining silent all the same words lost with thoughts streaming she knows she must be dreaming because somehow he knows her name in the darkness his glazed eyes are gleaming again screams her name but alas in vain in her spotlight still beaming two hundred gazes steaming thoughts frozen inside of her frame he says to her he says to her welcome to the show
6538032 bringer of wrong shes waited so long for some kind of change for some kind of rain to wash down her sins and cleanse away the pain of living so hollow and living so right it all ends tonight tonight is the night when all her dreams come true by mornings first light hell have smashed all she knew she welcomes his presence his lessons she learns and yearns for more hes opened a door inside of her soul a hole to be filled yet still her soft beauty remains still hes unable to change the fact that shes playing her part
6538033 the blind heart pretends the cruel north winds are stronger than the sun slicing down on everyone sharpening its razor on exposed skin to strip the flesh from the bones and sometimes when the glass in the mirror breaks it shatters everything that ive known and then sometimes i see myself as a prisoner in someone elses cell tortured for all the secrets i know forced to keep quiet when i should tell i do not like the answers i see in front of me written backwards in the mirror reflections telling me that i should get out get out get out get out i cannot leave this world that i have built around me out of hate i cant believe its grown so strong pain offers no escape i left behind the world i wanted and now its too late i cannot find a way to end this the blind heart must wait cruelty beyond comprehension as the sun lies high overhead something whispers softly in my ear it knows the real reason i am dead and then i saw a man i thought i recognized from a life i knew biting at my consciousness he looked me in the eye and said i am you i do not like the answers i see in front of me written backwards in the mirror reflections telling me that i should get out get out get out get out i cannot leave this world that i have built around me out of hate i cant believe its grown so strong pain offers no escape i left behind the world i wanted and now its too late i cannot find a way to end this the blind heart must wait the blind heart remembers the suns burning embers burning holes into your soul while the north winds blow so cold confusion takes a hold and paranoia takes my mind in every direction looking for answers my eyes fix on the eyes of the man inside the reflection and then i think of my lost childhood and peopel i knew and i finally find broken shards of glass rearranging the truth its not me the reflection is blind i do not like the answers i see in front of me written backwards in the mirror reflections telling me that i should get out get out get out get out i cannot leave this world that i have built around me out of hate i cant believe its grown so strong pain offers no escape i left behind the world i wanted and now its too late i cannot find a way to end this the blind heart must wait the blind heart descends as with the north winds not stronger than the sun slicing down on everyone

6538104 jetzt werden die innenminister sich untereinander nicht mehr trauen k nnen
6538105 w hrend der vergangenen herbstkonferenz der innenminister wurde zwischen senator ehrhart k rting und dem damaligen hamburger amtskollegen nagel die absprache getroffen kollegen nach berlin zur ckholen zu wollen
6538106 man darf bei der diskussion nicht au er acht lassen dass die vom land berlin ausgebildeten 502 beamten von hamburg als vollwertige vollzugsbeamte bernommen wurden ohne dass die hansestadt sich wenigstens anteilig an den kosten f r diese ausbildung beteiligt h tte dass herr glietsch sich jetzt auch vielleicht gegen die meinung einzelner mitarbeiter f r das anschreiben entschlossen hat ist aufgrund dieser grundlage durchaus nachvollziehbar
6538107 es gibt bereits ger chte wonach ein bestimmtes bundesland einer vielzahl von bewerbern f r den gehobenen dienst empfohlen hat sich mangels eigener ausbildungsm glichkeiten in berlin zum polizisten schulen zu lassen um nach erfolgreichem durchlauf der ausbildung in das eigene land zur ckzukehren
6538108 somit w rde das finanzielle ruinierte berlin die polizeiausbildung anderer bundesl nder finanzieren ohne selbst davon profitieren zu k nnen
6538109 polizeipr sident glietsch kann auch nur die stellen besetzen und die geh lter zahlen die ihm von der politik bewilligt werden das land hamburg hat davon profitiert dass wir keine freien stellen hatten die hansestadt hat 500 gute beamte quasi auf dem silbertablett serviert bekommen
6538110 wenn hamburg uns nun davon nur sieben zur ckgeben will ist es nur clever vom pr sidenten weitere zu k dern zumal es sich bei den 21 betroffenen um kollegen handelt die ernste gr nde f r eine r ckkehr haben

6538149 the idea came when i was talking to a friend of mine joe samuel who on the day of the rajiv gandhi assassination could not travel that day we spent a lot of time talking about the assassination and were wondering what could have made her do it this stayed with me for quite some time so finally when i wanted to make a film i decided that since in our country women are considered very creative people here you have a person who is very destructive maybe if you put a woman in a natural environment where she is very much associated with nature it rains theres violence and very real things and maybe she starts feeling differently maybe it affects her i liked the whole idea of how these thoughts run through someones head so we did a lot of screen tests we finally discovered ayesha dharker who i thought was simply beautiful because she didnt need not to talk to express her feelings which was i think what i like about her
6538150 the intelligence bureau later briefed the informal meeting of the ccpa cabinet committee on political affairs about the technology of the assassination based on the inspection of the scene of the blast discussions with the eye witnesses and experts including doctors and forensic science experts study of the photographs examination material objects recovered from the scene etc

6538187 we wouldnt go into a market without a partnership with someone who wanted us
6538188 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
6538189 this nation was built on a foundation of free speech the first principle of free speech is protected conscience
6538190 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6538191 planned parenthood continues to be concerned that the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6538192 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6538193 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6538194 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience
6538195 i felt like id do a lot better than this
6538196 when you practice and youre out there by yourself and you just want to turn it on and go you just go
6538197 im really disappointed in how flat i was in the last 200 meters
6538198 a lot of people dont understand that in running you practice different things just like a basketball team practices different plays you practice different segments of a race i really practiced closing it didnt work out well
6538199 ive got nothing else going on so i might as well
6538200 the other girls were just more ready to go it might just be one bad race its a shame it had to come at the olympics
6538201 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6538202 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6538203 if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions
6538204 we urge beneficiaries to choose wisely when selecting their drug coverage
6538205 again we emphasize that any changes to the coverage gap would need to come from congress
6538206 we will employ between 30 and 40 full or part time nurses and care assistants and have already been given permission to build subject to the repositioning of the entrance
6538207 small businesses are the backbone of our economy creating new jobs while developing innovative products and services
6538208 having a dream is enough to get your business started but to find success entrepreneurs must build a strong financial foundation and establish their presence on the web
6538209 our goal is to provide entrepreneurs with the easiest to use business management tools and resources available so they can clear these hurdles
6538210 starting a small business is the american dream but keeping your books in order can be a nightmare
6538211 i speak on behalf of cincinnatis smallest enterprises and job creators when i say that this opportunity to receive free software and training is invaluable to entrepreneurs
6538212 the members of ccia are eager to share the benefits of their financial management software with those who need it most from free tax preparation for low income americans to start up financial software for small businesses ccia knows that technology is meaningless if it is not accessible to all
6538213 il milan ha aggiunto galliani aveva dato la disponibilit ad acquisire il giocatore in prestito con diritto di riscatto ma il chelsea ha detto di no poich voleva un acquisizione a titolo definitivo quindi ha concluso il dirigente rossonero la trattativa saltata
6538214 the key for me is that you play as a unit of five and you incorporate that speed into your game
6538215 a lot of it stems from just moving your feet youre going to put the opposition on their heels
6538216 every player has a comfort level of skating where they know theyre not going to fall down
6538217 we try to push players beyond that comfort level so that when they get in the game there may be a little bit of a drop off but its better than the level they were playing at
6538218 the style of play that we want to instill in our players is we want to play to win the game not play to not lose the game
6538219 its very easy to play and be afraid to make mistakes instead of forcing the play it can be tempting to back off and see what they bring when you do that youre on your heels and youre in chase mode toward your own net instead of chase mode toward the oppositions
6538220 playgrounds provide children with a sense of freedom and develops their skills of exploration
6538221 the chrysler jeep and dodge dealers of hampton roads are proud to participate in the building of this play structure that will attract children and families back to denby park
6538222 thanks to the generous support of the projects sponsors the children of the denby park will now have a close and convenient playground to call their own
6538223 it is clear that those who are rich and white will continue to be treated differently to those who are poor
6538224 these cases and outbreaks serve as a reminder that measles can and still does occur in the united states
6538225 these cases resulted primarily from failure to vaccinate many because of philosophical or religious belief
6538226 the vaccine against measles is highly effective in preventing infections and high immunization levels in the community are effective at preventing or drastically decreasing the size of outbreaks
6538227 we are so pleased to showcase the wonderful talents of afterschool students by using a poster designed by one of them for lights on afterschool this year
6538228 on october 16 all across the country we will send the message that americans want to keep the lights on for children and well do it in an energy conscious way supporting afterschool programs and conserving energy both help ensure a better future for our youth
6538229 it was pretty tough out there in the wind whilst we got some rain early on and that always makes it uncomfortable
6538230 the good thing is that a two under par 68 is probably the worst score i could have shot today and if it had not been for a couple of three putts i could have easily finished at four under
6538231 but ive got no real complaints and it was another day for being patient and im pleased i managed to do that
6538232 i still need to work on my putting and thats why i am heading to the practice putting green so hopefully this round will be my poor round for the week
6538233 its disappointing whenever anyone leaves the police but its also disappointing the way he did it
6538234 this has been done to ensure that students are held accountable for their actions and that the school does everything possible to ensure the safety of all students both at school and while travelling to and from school
6538235 we can confirm that mr gadd has left bangkok and is heading to the uk
6538236 our industry feedback is indicating that urac accreditation is becoming a standard for purchasers and benefit consultants
6538237 it demonstrates that companies have achieved organizational excellence and validates their commitment to quality and accountability
6538238 i mean clearly my obsession isnt going to be so secret anymore
6538239 rafa est jugando mejor que todos y es el favorito est ganando en todos lados da igual la pista lo nico que va en su contra es el esfuerzo que le puede pesar

6538245 it wasnt the greatest night it was pretty hot and halfway through the course she ran out of gas a bit
6538246 its only her second competition back after surgery and the week caught up with her a little bit
6538247 i just feel a bit sorry for the horse she deserved better than that
6538248 were going to have a bit of a lay off and try competing again next year
6538249 girl y frilly as we were so dramatically full of imagination too
6538250 he better respect you and try never to touch you too much
6538251 we are more than conquerors through the one who loved us for i am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor rulers nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor anything above nor anything below nor anything else in all creation can separate us from the love of god that is in christ jesus our lord
6538252 while he was cleaning the fish tank in his house he was holding a fish in his hand and went to the toilet for passing urine
6538253 when he was passing urine the fish slipped from his hand and entered his urethra and then he developed all these symptoms
6538254 mentally he was sound and clinically he was absolutely a normal person with no previous history of any psychiatric illness
6538255 these foreign bodies were inserted or applied for autoerotic psychiatric therapeutic or no definite reasons by the patient
6538256 most patients were too ashamed to admit they had inserted or applied any object and usually presented when a complication had occurred from the foreign body such as difficulty in voiding hematuria pain or swelling extravasations or abscess formation our case is a peculiar one
6538257 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
6538258 as if say the obama campaign countered criticisms of his resume by pointing out that hes black oh wait

6538264 we often run surveys among our members to ensure we have a continual understanding of their challenges and needs
6538265 this particular survey shines a bright spotlight on the struggles of working parents and because its simply impossible for parents to be in two places at once also reminds us how crucial it is for todays families to find affordable child care options that dont have them digging deep into their pockets
6538266 were excited to tell atlantis stories on a bigger canvas
6538267 the best argument against democracy is a five minute conversation with the average voter
6538268 our goal is to work together with local leaders and citizens for the benefit of healthier communities and that starts with children
6538269 rep turner and his efforts represent terrific examples of what we can all accomplish when we keep the end result in mind rep turner has been a true champion for the childrens health insurance program and through his leadership and commitment the legislature has increased access to health insurance for texas children in need were thrilled to recognize rep turner for his work and were equally excited to witness achievements that will assist in making our kids and communities healthier
6538270 the amerigroup foundations commitment and many contributions focused on encouraging healthy families and communities have been tremendous
6538271 i appreciate their support of great organizations like the brookhollow baptist church ralph douglas west scholarship ministry that positively impacts so many lives in our community
6538272 what the heck why not try to get buzz bissinger come and speak to the class
6538273 theyre putting in instant replay at the little league world series
6538274 i dont want to crush any dreams here but the odds of you making it to the nba are infinitesimal but your odds of being a doctor or a lawyer or an accountant are not
6538275 i wish boobie was here tonight so that he could tell you how much he wished he had taken his education seriously
6538276 cleveland clinic continues to put patients first this expansion allows the initiation of cleveland clinic care upon the arrival of our teams and ensures the highest quality of service world wide
6538277 while in the air our team has the full complement of cleveland clinic expertise at its disposal via direct communication with the clinic or back to the referring physician we provide a seamless transition of care and on scene initiation of cleveland clinic treatment
6538278 as one of the leading healthcare institutions in the world it is our responsibility to share our resources with others
6538279 this expansion brings cleveland clinic care to a patients bedside worldwide it is an advanced practice model that is designed to meet the needs of the patient not one in which the patient must meet the needs of the system furthermore the addition will broaden the resources that will be available for a global response
6538280 rant what is up with live earth 1 of 2
6538281 people would not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
6538282 the overhaul of the edgar system is something edgar online has advocated for years through its involvement in the development of xbrl as an interactive data solution
6538283 idea is built upon xbrl the same platform underlying i metrix and our other core products and services as a result we are uniquely positioned to offer additional tools and services as other asset classes are moved into idea using xbrl
6538284 were at the tip of the iceberg on financial information yet to be tagged in xbrl and edgar online is positioned to play a key role in providing tagging services infrastructure and analytic tools to regulators corporations and investors looking to take advantage of this rapidly expanding format
6538285 if the secs xbrl proposal is mandated we expect approximately 2 3 of
6538286 while cornyn hasnt contacted our campaign for the past two weeks to even agree to debate more unfortunate is that hes been out of touch with texas families for nearly six years
6538287 theres a whole lot more pressure on retailers to hold back price increases and theres less pressure when prices are coming down so theyre able to expand margins
6538288 the reality is if the retailer didnt start expanding margins right now youre not going to see that station open much longer
6538289 many gasoline stations are now trying to recapture some of the lost margins as the cost of gasoline comes down
6538290 we still have some of that to get passed through we still have certainly more than a dime to go probably more than that
6538291 over the last month the supermarkets have played a large part in bringing prices down by forcing other retailers to bring prices down too
6538292 its typical that at retail level when wholesale gasoline prices and the price of oil goes up they tend to get passed on more quickly than when prices are coming down
6538293 over the long term prices will come back down due to competitive market pressures
6538294 as far as transfer speculation is concerned i know nothing about whether he is going to go or stay
6538295 as far as him as a person he is a great professional a tremendous player and for me last season he was probably one of the top three buys in the premier league
6538296 he is just the whole package good in the air he can hold the ball it was a great return for what blackburn paid
6538297 but when it comes to transfer money i dont even know if he is saleable what with myself and bentley already gone youd have to call john williams blackburn chairman and ask him that
6538298 it would be tough if three of us were to leave in one summer
6538299 hes a hard worker and came into the premier league with people thinking hed had a lot of injuries and might not play that much
6538300 but i think he missed two training seasons all year and worked his socks off
6538301 i cant believe people passed up on him last year maybe they were thrown off by his injuries i cant say enough good things about roque santa cruz hes a lovely fellow and a great guy
6538302 i do not see them having a problem with relegation
6538303 no club has been in touch with us at all
6538304 the best thing that could happen is that no player leaves right now espanyol have a fantastic team
6538305 the club has fixed a price on the player and we are not going to accept less this is exactly what has happened with espanyol striker luis garcia and this is the strategy that we are going to follow with all
6538306 it caught me unaware i must say i thought in the spirit of a friendly match that sort of thing wouldnt have happened
6538307 of course it is we all try in this day and age to respect other people
6538308 its been a central plank of the work fifa and uefa are doing
6538309 weve got very very good relationships with the scottish football association
6538310 lets get it in perspective lets deal with the issue and lets deal with it in a way that we can learn from it
6538311 the sfa is obviously disappointed that a minority of our fans chose not to respect the visitors national anthem
6538312 the tartan army have a richly deserved reputation as fantastic ambassadors for their country
6538313 friendly matches are in the domain of fifa it is not uefas responsibility
6538314 unfortunately this is not a new thing but there are no sanctions we can impose
6538315 we ran a successful campaign during the european championships to get fans to respect their opponents national anthems
6538316 its about education and we can only hope that respect is shown
6538317 it is unfortunate that the actions of some supporters have tarnished the outstanding reputation of the tartan army
6538318 all fans should respect the national anthems of all teams
6538319 i can surprise you sometimes as i got one in whom you did not expect and there still might be one more player coming in
6538320 you know the position but i cannot tell you much more
6538321 but we are not in a desperate situation because we have song back from the olympics diaby does not look too far away and hopefully we can good news from tomas rosicky in the next two weeks
6538322 we are not short short but one more body is possible
6538323 i believe once somebody cannot play for you in europe it devalues the player for the season but it is not necessarily stopping you from buying a player
6538324 i felt manchester united had made up their mind to let him go before we were interested to maybe manchester city or to france so it was not necessarily us going in there and buying a player
6538325 he can play centre back he can play left back and that is an area where we were a bit inexperienced
6538326 he has a great team attitude and he can help us in the dressing room as well with his maturity
6538327 you know how important he is on the creative side of our game and you want him to be in the team but we do not want to face a gamble for just one game and we have to be patient
6538328 we will have to asses him on monday or tuesday to see how big a gamble it will be to start him or not
6538329 football raises a lot of money and if you can help other people you should
6538330 a club has a social responsibility maybe in england more than anywhere else because here a club grew out of its environment within a city
6538331 one of the strengths at arsenal is that we are very conscious of that social responsibility
6538332 sie haben demnach entschieden internationale milit rische zusammenarbeit zwischen russland und nato staaten zu stoppen
6538333 when i pulled up a crowd of people surrounded the car and stared as if they were seeing extraterrestrial beings
6538334 instead of focusing on the burn victims the nurses kept repeating you drove them here
6538335 my daughter took the right decision at the right time
6538336 as far as nato and isaf natos international security assistance force isaf are concerned the allegations in le monde are completely unfounded
6538337 we deny the report we have no information whatsoever that would indicate that the french soldiers were killed by nato planes
6538338 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or wounded were consistent with air delivered ordnance
6538339 we know that the planes supplying what we call close air support could not engage because the french troops were very close to the taliban insurgents
6538340 if they had engaged there might have been considerable collateral damage if bombs had been used
6538341 no french soldier at any time during the incident came on the radio to say that they were taking friendly fire and no french soldier after the event has mentioned to the chain of command that this might have been the case
6538342 there was fire from machine guns on american planes that were guided by american special forces and we have no information that enables us to consider that the french soldiers were killed under fire from nato planes
6538343 to determine how to improve quality increase production improve working conditions and reduce costs
6538344 by using a quality circle you can create your own system of reflective feedback no need to wait for the law school administration to implement a whole new system of evaluations
6538345 at the beginning of the term announce that a quality circle will be used to provide feedback about your teaching the classroom experience and student performance in class ask for a handful of students to volunteer for the quality circle as a service to other students or ask the class to hold an election
6538346 unfortunately i cannot pay you for your advice nor will i bump up your grade the only credit for participating therefore is the knowledge that you will be influencing the development of the course and some fun conversations and perhaps some good cheese if you catch me at the right time of day
6538347 volunteers should be willing to devote about an hour each week to the task if you take class participation into account in grading it is important to emphasize that participation in the quality circle will not be considered this would inhibit frank discussion in quality circle meetings and would be unfair to other students
6538348 we might die from medication but we sure killed all the pain
6538349 scarred on mtv a few years ago i fell while rollerblading and my arm looked like something off that show its still kinda crooked to this day
6538350 is currently on loading humanitarian relief materials in her home port of gaeta italy and will proceed to georgia later this month
6538351 the ships will deliver thousands of blankets hygiene kits baby food and infant care supplies to save lives and alleviate human suffering
6538352 the russians have been informed along the way about our activities and our intentions
6538353 this storm is turning into a serious catastrophic flooding event particularly in southern brevard county
6538354 to save lives and to protect property public health and safety
6538355 a slow motion toward the west northwest is forecast to begin soon and continue for the next couple of days
6538356 this was not a shooting that was a random act
6538357 we dont know the particulars as to why it escalated to the situation that occurred today
6538358 it is clear that those who are rich and white will continue to be treated differently to those who are poor
6538359 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6538360 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6538361 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6538362 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6538363 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6538364 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6538365 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6538366 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6538367 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6538368 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6538369 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6538370 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6538371 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6538372 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6538373 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6538374 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6538375 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6538376 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6538377 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6538378 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6538379 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6538380 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6538381 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6538382 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6538383 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6538384 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6538385 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6538386 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6538387 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6538388 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6538389 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6538390 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6538391 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6538392 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6538393 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6538394 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6538395 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6538396 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6538397 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6538398 spiritual discourse always keeps the soul free from self esteem for it gives every part of the soul a sense of light so that it no longer needs the praise of men
6538399 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6538400 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6538401 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6538402 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6538403 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6538404 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6538405 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6538406 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6538407 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6538408 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6538409 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6538410 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6538411 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6538412 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6538413 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6538414 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6538415 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6538416 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6538417 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6538418 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6538419 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6538420 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6538421 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6538422 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6538423 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6538424 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6538425 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6538426 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6538427 it was built for god but not used for god
6538428 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6538429 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6538430 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6538431 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6538432 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6538433 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6538434 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6538435 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6538436 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6538437 this is a planning took where all things are going
6538438 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6538439 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6538440 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6538441 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6538442 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6538443 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6538444 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6538445 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6538446 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6538447 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6538448 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6538449 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6538450 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6538451 as far as nato and isaf natos international security assistance force isaf are concerned the allegations in le monde are completely unfounded
6538452 we deny the report we have no information whatsoever that would indicate that the french soldiers were killed by nato planes
6538453 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or wounded were consistent with air delivered ordnance
6538454 we know that the planes supplying what we call close air support could not engage because the french troops were very close to the taliban insurgents
6538455 if they had engaged there might have been considerable collateral damage if bombs had been used
6538456 no french soldier at any time during the incident came on the radio to say that they were taking friendly fire and no french soldier after the event has mentioned to the chain of command that this might have been the case
6538457 there was fire from machine guns on american planes that were guided by american special forces and we have no information that enables us to consider that the french soldiers were killed under fire from nato planes
6538458 fifteen to 20 minutes after the engagement of our forces a support section left the base camp and took around 40 to 50 minutes to get to the scene
6538459 as far as nato and isaf natos international security assistance force isaf are concerned the allegations in le monde are completely unfounded
6538460 we deny the report we have no information whatsoever that would indicate that the french soldiers were killed by nato planes

6538471 in most other asset classes 63 percent growth in assets under management would be a pretty good story but the 100 percent plus growth in carbon markets between 2006 and 2007 has outpaced growth in carbon funds

6538475 i think the market is now taking into account the major implications by russias power play on the global market in the longer term
6538476 since the 110 level wasnt broken the bears dont have the momentum trade on their side anymore and were moving back to a market dominated by supply demand data and geopolitical news

6538479 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you gotta make five million dollars and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6538480 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6538481 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6538482 when somebody makes that argument particularly given that i spent my entire life working with workers low income communities to try to make peoples lives a little bit better then thats when you know were in political silly season

6538489 although we were unable to capture the dogs animal services will be working with zoo officials to place traps in the area to capture the dogs additionally we are actively patrolling the area
6538490 because of the quick response of our security animal control and eppd no other animals were harmed
6538491 our zoo keepers are crushed at the loss of these two longstanding animals at the zoo
6538492 hope was a female pronghorn antelope who arrived here in 1990 and dakota a sandhill crane known for following keepers around when they were feeding him or cleaning the exhibit he had been here since 1994
6538493 there are a lot of dogs that run lose throughout neighborhoods and its a problem at many zoos

6538560 to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions

6538665 e inaccettabile che in una democrazia un uomo che ha il monopolio dellinformazione televisiva si candidi a guidare il paese per cinque volte di seguito in 14 anni chi ricorda che questa e una cosa inaccettabile per una democrazia passa per una persona noiosa ovvia che dice cose grossolane ma non e grossolano dire queste cose ma e grossolana la realta italiana lassuefazione italiana a considerare normali cose che in una democrazia non lo sono e una cosa molto molto grave

6538692 a consideration of the applicability of the fair use doctrine simply is part of that initial review
6538693 having reviewed the video we acknowledge that its inclusion in the take down notice was an error and the error however was completely unintentional
6538694 viacom has no alternative accept to repeatedly search the entire youtube library
6538695 and send take down notices this is a massive effort we have manually reviewed over 1 7 million clips on youtube and have identified more than 187 000 pirated clips of our copyrighted content in an effort of this scale some inadvertent error is inevitable
6538696 if that doesnt prove that viacom knew my film wasnt their material i dont know what can
6538697 universal said she infringed on her copyright and sent a take down notice she then has an opportunity to appeal to youtube counter notification remedy which is what she sought and the video was restored
6538698 the dmca streamlined the process but the law also tried to balance it

6538710 having moved to the united states in 1961 he francisco ayala was shocked when in the mid 1970s california sought to introduce an antievolution curriculum into its public schools how could this be in the most scientifically advanced country in the world his bewilderment led ayala to a lifelong study of how evolution is or is not taught in public schools

6538712 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
6538713 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6538714 mr ayers is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something that i deplore 40 years ago when i was 6 or 7 years old
6538715 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6538716 when the american public fully understands the close continuing relationship between their potential president and a remorseless domestic terrorist we believe it will send a chill down their spines
6538717 one of the aims of irans 10 year space program is to send a manned rocket into space

6538720 the leadership of nma and its officers have voiced strong support for the organization
6538721 if customers really were clamoring for conspicuous calorie counts restaurants would provide them voluntarily

6538723 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
6538724 in terms of whos an elitist i think people have made a judgment that john mccain is not an arugula eating pointy headed professor type based on his life story
6538725 michael bay really knows how to make an actor feel welcomed at first its a weird sensation but after awhile it feels like a tiny kitten delightfully romping in a dewy meadow
6538726 we can confirm he has left bangkok for the uk
6538727 i can confirm that he has now left on the flight to london
6538728 god am i happy to be leaving vietnam and that jail i should never have been in there
6538729 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6538730 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6538731 la vida vale la pena si aprendo a hacer el camino
6538732 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
6538733 now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you gotta make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6538734 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6538735 what people are going through every single day here in america
6538736 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6538737 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6538738 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6538739 maybe youre struggling just to pay the mortgage on your home
6538740 then again that same day when asked how many houses he owns mccain lost track he couldnt remember well its seven seven houses
6538741 and heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6538742 from my perspective obama needs to introduce a game changer and fast before public opinion starts to gel around the notion that he is a phenom who deserves great respect but is not seasoned enough and would be too much of a risk in the oval office

6538750 we raised the legal issues and reasoning to explain to the constitutional council of our denial of the complaints of irregularities by the political parties
6538751 we have full legal documents and fair evidence to show the constitutional council to defend the nec decision
6538752 all of the documents are very strong legally because all the decisions by the nec depend on legal principles internal rules and procedures so we hope that the decision of the constitutional council ill also depend on the same legalities

6538767 the power of accurate observation is commonly called cynicism by those who have not got it
6538768 nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity
6538769 i do not feel obliged to believe that the same god who has endowed us with sense reason and intellect has intended us to forego their use
6538770 if you cant say anything nice come sit by me
6538771 the beautiful part of writing is that you dont have to get it right the first time unlike say a brain surgeon
6538772 the person be it gentleman or lady who has not satisfaction in a good novel must be intolerably stupid
6538773 most journalism is people who cant write interviewing people who cant talk for people who cant read

6538780 es por eso que repito que esta es una gran oportunidad para que la fiscal a saque adelante este caso as tenga que meter preso a un ex fiscal general de la rep blica y le repito en esta onda deportiva que se gan su medalla de oro
6538781 lo importante es que las actas estaban forjadas lo importante es que el ministerio p blico nos diga si en realidad la experticia que realizaron demuestra que estaban forjadas y si esas actas estaban forjadas contaminan el caso de los materiales contaminan el caso de los intelectuales contaminan todo el expediente del caso anderson
6538782 afortunadamente veo que aqu la fiscal a esta citaron a isa as rodr guez citaron a landaeta y lo nico que le critico a la fiscal a en este caso es que para m entender creo que van un poquito lento

6538796 snow and glacial ice melting provide a very important source for fresh water for irrigation energy and drinking water downstream
6538797 the drier areas are becoming drier while the wetter areas are becoming wetter
6538798 in the past the rivers had a fairly constant flow throughout the summer due to melt water now you have a lot of rain in the spring and then you have fairly dry conditions throughout the rest of the summer
6538799 maybe before your district was suffering from one flash flood every season and that was perhaps what people managed to cope with but if you get three or four or five flash floods maybe thats too much the question is how much more can people tolerate without losing their basis for livelihood

6538820 even when i went to get my hair cut the hairdresser had been reading it
6538821 it meant that i had that time to reflect on what went on in that day
6538822 there was an agreement in my bible study and indaba mid sized discussion group that people would not share stories that people said could not be shared
6538823 my strategy was to have my blog audience get a sense of what the day was like and the kind of topics we were dealing with rather than give my own viewpoint on what should and should not have been said
6538824 they helped get the story of lambeth directly from the bishops
6538825 something kind of star trekky where bishops appear on web cams instantly talking to their dioceses
6538826 one thing im sure of though for lambeth 2008 all those study documents and reports just wont have to be typed in people will just read them out and the words will appear on the screen

6538853 i am looking forward to the wonderful possibilities of teaching art at such a growing institution as high point university
6538854 when were creative we feel we are living more fully than during the rest of life the excitement of the artist at the easel or the scientist in the lab comes dose to the ideal fulfillment we all hope to get from life and so rarely do perhaps only sex sports music and religious ecstasy even when these experiences remain fleeting and leave no trace provide a profound sense of being part of an entity greater than ourselves but creativity also leaves an outcome that adds to the richness and complexity of the future
6538855 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses

6538861 there is a lot of depth here but an olympic final is a funny thing because there is a huge amount pressure it can be really frightening if you let it so well have to see how everyone copes
6538862 i think it is pretty much same conditions for everyone all the lanes are fair
6538863 languages of the world this is an archive of over 1 500 human languages assembled in the year 02008 c e magnify 1 000 times to find over 13 000 pages of language documentation
6538864 you know how important cesc is on the creative side of our game and you want him to be in the team but we do not want to face a gamble for just one game and we have to be patient
6538865 we will have to assess him on monday or tuesday to see how big a gamble it will be to start him or not
6538866 i think we are all pushing very very hard its a closer season than it was last year
6538867 i think all the teams are perhaps pushing even more to the edge and thats where you really see mistakes starting to happen
6538868 this year there are lots of opportunities to make mistakes and there are lots of unknowns we come to new circuits lots of different things with the car
6538869 todo el material probatorio que se ha incautado lo tiene la comisi n que est en el aeropuerto investigando sobre los hechos

6538881 i did feel very sexy during the photo shoot and i was really getting into it there was a moment there when i thought maybe i should just take it all off but i dont think im ready to be a centrefold
6538882 few states if any will get more attention than new mexico reid wilson editor of realclearpolitics
6538883 to a lot of us its disturbing where we are at
6538884 we are doing what we can to help in this situation but again the costs associated with maintenance were established as part of the original agreemnt with the state
6538885 the thing that is of most concern is that this issue has been going on for two years
6538886 all of the sudden here we are 60 days out from the general election and were no better than we were
6538887 i would have to say if i were pointing fingers it would be at secretary of states office
6538888 ive kept every email in case they say we are not serving the county clerks
6538889 we will test every machine before we even send them to polling places we are going to recertify retest theres not going to be no problems
6538890 please have them to contact our office with their concerns
6538891 we would definitely like to work with anybody who has these concerns
6538892 the biggest worry is that these machines will stop working and we wont know why
6538893 if something goes wrong we may not have enough replacement machines to go around it wouldnt stop people from voting they could vote on paper ballots but that would take longer
6538894 it puts us in a bad position beause we dont know how to fix these machines we always have known how to fix the previous machines it puts us out of compliance of state law and makes us vulnerable on election day
6538895 but i will make sure the counties can sustain the expenses
6538896 some of them have been working fine and all of a sudden they dont work anymore
6538897 in a perfect world id like to have twice as many cards as we need
6538898 we only have one company programming all cards we would have liked to be able to be more independent

6538901 has faithfully tried to live this apology and accompany words with action
6538902 its disappointing whenever anyone leaves the police but its also disappointing the way he did it
6538903 the use of the car was unauthorised and it was wrong had he not resigned it would have been a matter dealt with under the code of conduct and it would have been serious misconduct
6538904 its the end of a career that he was very proud of

6538909 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
6538910 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
6538911 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
6538912 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin

6538943 i wouldnt normally go get some guy to do it if i were at home id go into my dads shop and get a tool i just didnt have the option here
6538944 i think setting an artificial timetable for withdrawal is a significant mistake it is it sends mixed signals and bad signals to the region and to the iraqi citizens listen the iraqis are wondering whether or not were going to stay to help people in america wonder whether or not theyve got the political will to do the hard work
6538945 and if the congress wants to test my will as to whether or not ill accept the timetable for withdrawal i wont accept one i just dont think its in the interest of our troops i think it im just envisioning what it would be like to be a young soldier in the middle of iraq and realizing that politicians have all of a sudden made military determinations and in my judgment that would put a kid in harms way more so than he or she already is
6538946 the prime minister says what iraq and her people now need is time not a timetable they seek our patience not political posturing they require resolve not our retreat were going to succeed in iraq if given a chance liberty will succeed every time and liberty will help yield the peace we need
6538947 theres a temptation to let the politics at home get in the way with the considered judgment of the commanders thats why i strongly rejected an artificial timetable of withdrawal its kind of like an arbitrary thing you know we will decide in the halls of congress how to conduct our affairs in iraq based upon polls and politics and were going to impose this on people as opposed to listening to our commanders and our diplomats and listening to the iraqis for that matter
6538948 in the area of security cooperation the president and the prime minister agreed that improving conditions should allow for the agreements now under negotiation to include a general time horizon for meeting aspirational goals
6538949 hes a great kid to coach and i love him to death

6538970 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
6538971 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6538972 mr ayers is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something that i deplore 40 years ago when i was 6 or 7 years old
6538973 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6538974 when the american public fully understands the close continuing relationship between their potential president and a remorseless domestic terrorist we believe it will send a chill down their spines

6538980 in terms of whos an elitist i think people have made a judgment that john mccain is not an arugula eating pointy headed professor type based on his life story
6538981 for two or three of his researches he deserves the highest honor a scientific man can obtain but the sum of his work is absolutely overwhelming had he never lived the aspect of chemistry would be very different from that it is now but do we truly know the man behind the science
6538982 the public doesnt know who on earth john mccain is
6538983 simply doesnt understand the challenges americas working families are facing because he isnt remotely affected by them
6538984 its hard not to get all swept up in florida i mean the beautiful beaches are too hard to pass up i cant help but keep coming back

6539010 it would be comfortable let us say from a logistics standpoint to have people in camps but in no way is that something that we strive to achieve
6539011 we have two areas in the country which are camp like one with about 3 000 people who have come in from darfur and another one in north central areas of the country which now has 6 000 people in it so it is camp like
6539012 in general most of our aid operation is managing to reach people who are in smaller communities or in the bush quite close to their homes and this is something which enables them to have a semblance of normality about their life and that is something we really want to sustain until they choose to go home

6539042 i think we are all pushing very very hard its a closer season than it was last year
6539043 i think all the teams are perhaps pushing even more to the edge and thats where you really see mistakes starting to happen
6539044 this year there are lots of opportunities to make mistakes and there are lots of unknowns we come to new circuits lots of different things with the car
6539045 we offered a loan deal with a permanent option but chelsea said no because they wanted to sell him outright
6539046 you know how important cesc is on the creative side of our game and you want him to be in the team but we do not want to face a gamble for just one game and we have to be patient
6539047 we will have to assess him on monday or tuesday to see how big a gamble it will be to start him or not
6539048 cosa hai fatto con la vita che ti ho dato
6539049 per tutta la vita sono stato schiavo sia dei soldi che del tempo
6539050 its a unique format thats never been done before in the united states
6539051 thanks for the good times joey please keep to your side of the floor
6539052 ya hemos alcanzado el objetivo de reducir a la mitad el n mero de personas que carecen de ellos y estamos adelantados en nuestra meta de lograr el acceso universal para 2014
6539053 ustedes conocen la belleza de nuestra naci n y nuestra biodiversidad pero tambi n saben que madagascar es uno de los pa ses m s pobres del mundo
6539054 por lo que alcanzamos una cobertura de 88 y 74 por ciento de la poblaci n respectivamente
6539055 estamos en excelente posici n para ser anfitriones del pr ximo luego del que tendr lugar en turqu a en 2009 esto pondr el foco y todas las actividades de toma de conciencia en frica y en el hemisferio sur
6539056 si se va a transformar a una naci n primero hay que atender ciertas necesidades b sicas por eso el agua y los servicios sanitarios son tan importantes
6539057 madagascar es totalmente conciente de la importancia del agua los servicios sanitarios y la higiene para el desarrollo comunitario y econ mico
6539058 m s que el total de fallecimientos provocados por el paludismo el sarampi n y el sida
6539059 no estamos hablando de algo tan complejo como construir un cohete para llevar gente a la luna sino de ense ar a los ni os a lavarse las manos con jab n y mejorar el acceso de las aldeas al agua potable
6539060 definitivamente es un nuevo fen meno lo que estamos presenciando muestra un compromiso de parte de estos pa ses para impedir que abusadores de ni os ingresen a sus fronteras
6539061 este es el resultado del intercambio de informaci n entre las autoridades
6539062 se cree que la regi n atrae al mayor n mero de turistas sexuales y abusadores de ni os
6539063 son hombres locales aunque los extranjeros est n m s en los medios
6539064 pocos de estos casos llegan los tribunales locales la mayor a son resueltos dentro de las comunidades donde hay transferencias de dinero y compensaciones para las familias de las v ctimas el caso se cierra pero el abusador permanece libre
6539065 por el comercio sexual adulto donde son explotados por personas locales se estima que nueve de cada 10 clientes de prostitutas o prostitutos menores de edad son filipinos
6539066 en la isla indonesia de batam son los turistas de singapur quienes apuntalan la demanda de sexo con menores asimismo los turistas chinos y tailandeses van al estado de shan en birmania para aprovecharse de los trabajadores del sexo menores de edad
6539067 es razonable considerar el m todo quir rgico como alternativa en el caso de que los pacientes no respondan adecuadamente a alguna de las dos medicinas utilizadas
6539068 esta t cnica es una alternativa no un sustituto del tratamiento farmacol gico aclar gronseth ya que hasta el 15 por ciento de los pacientes con neuralgia trigeminal tienen trastornos subyacentes que empeoran los s ntomas como un tumor
6539069 pero los episodios pueden ser constantes durante d as semanas o meses y luego desaparecer durante a os por lo que su diagn stico precoz y posterior tratamiento se hacen muy complicados

6539128 ive always thought it seemed a bit unlikely but im not going to tell you it hadnt been fun
6539129 im going to let the campaign take from here theyre going to reveal what they want to reveal when they want to reveal it
6539130 its been nice to be mentioned but im going to let them do the heavy lifting at this point
6539131 ill let you be the grammar judge although ive never been known for accuracy in grammar so it would be hard to scrutinize my grammar and make a conclusion

6539133 ugly is irrelevant it is an immeasurable insult to a woman and then supposedly the worst crime you can commit as a woman but ugly as beautiful is an illusion
6539134 i am so beautiful sometimes people weep when they see me and it has nothing to do with what i look like really it is just that i gave myself the power to say that i am beautiful and if i could do that maybe there is hope for them too and the great divide between the beautiful and the ugly will cease to be because we are all what we choose
6539135 its very frustrating because were always judging women on their appearance its so casual and never questioned there needs to be somebody standing around and asking why this is still happening

6539141 pero el presidente tambi n coment que su gobierno respetar la propiedad privada esto significa que tiene planes para obtener los terrenos
6539142 en los pr ximos d as haremos numerosas movilizaciones en diferentes partes del pa s para protestar contra la siembra masiva de soja porque empobrece el suelo y las fumigaciones contaminan r os y arroyos

6539145 law school taught me how to be a good lawyer but i did not learn how to run a practice

6539150 are you going to live in an apartment that smells of rich mahogany
6539151 overwhelmingly positive with some scattered thats a crazy thing to do felling
6539152 there are no tried and true road maps in media any more
6539153 theres no one way to get from any one place to another place anymore the more flexible you are the better chances you have of adapting in this very strange media environment we have nowadays
6539154 all the lessons ive learned in the beltway will serve me well in the great white north
6539155 the air is so clean it almost hurts my east coast lungs

6539158 its time for me to even the score between annandale and alaska
6539159 i went to a saturday night baseball game and they didnt bother turning the lights on because the sun never went down now thats a fun place to live
6539160 all i know is i fell in love with halibut tacos and im not looking back
6539161 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
6539162 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job
6539163 well that is our job we dont technically get money for
6539164 when we opted out we told major league baseball it was not a negotiating tactic we need a new deal
6539165 baseball is really really important digital content because of the volume of games and the time of year they play
6539166 if they have the rights in a country they have the rights to stream
6539167 this is the first time we ve allowed someone to stream live games and we do it with a lot of thought they understand rights and they treat rights appropriately while i think it s a value for value exchange and its fair for both sides we wouldnt have done that with many other potential partners
6539168 espn and fox are such large national partners were duty bound to negotiate with them theyre so vital to the industry that if they wanted to do something wed have to work with them very hard
6539169 putting this stuff online doesnt really keep people from watching your television bowman i must give him credit also understands he can build his online business and work with me on building our online business
6539170 it seemed to make sense to us in some ways its helpful to promote mlb tv
6539171 we believe in our content and were grateful that espn does too
6539172 its not cannibalistic if all of it is ours its hard to resist things that are good for your customers if you keep trying to keep people from tivo ing things or not get games ultimately youre going to make your customers mad
6539173 we understand the importance of local rights economically philosophically and baseball was wise to set up the system they have when the time is right and in the manner that is right it will occur maybe in five years but no one knows there are so many important stakeholders her the fans the rights holders the affiliates theres just a lot of stakeholders here maybe the nba will start down a good path and well see
6539174 if we have exclusive rights we expect to be the only way to get there
6539175 inspirational sometimes all of us forget that love for movies that internal spark inside us that movies lit and overstreets book is going to remind many of us about it

6539184 well that is our job we dont technically get money for you
6539185 we got talking with other members and it seemed like a good idea to donate one to the chelsea
6539186 currently 76 million people across the country are suffering with both chronic and acute pain this number doesnt even include veterans
6539187 widespread pain in the muscles ligaments and tendons as well as fatigue and multiple tender points places on the body where slight pressure about nine pounds causes pain
6539188 narrowing of the spinal cord causing nerve pinching which leads to persistent pain in the buttocks limping lack of feeling in the lower extremities and decreased physical activity
6539189 they removed my uterus and both ovaries and put me on massive doses of estrogen at the time they had no idea what that much estrogen would do to people
6539190 after that i was like time out no more meds
6539191 to sit and do nothing was not and is not an option for me
6539192 i fractured my right shoulder wrestling a vacuum on a flight of stairs and the vacuum obviously won
6539193 i did my left elbow on my 40th birthday at a roller rink
6539194 its like there is a circuit board in your body that is constantly misfiring
6539195 i loved everything about my job and at the time it was the purpose in my life

6539198 you have to look for the joy and goodness in life

6539201 he has been tremendous with me and he is my hero he tells me im his hero because he doesnt know of anyone who could live with the health issues i have and accomplish things i have
6539202 when your pain is under control you get to do the things most people take for granted
6539203 for me hope is the biggest word in my vocabulary
6539204 these diseases allowed me to move my life in a completely different direction im doing what i am supposed to do in life reaching out and helping others
6539205 i had a prescription for vicodin filled last november for 60 tablets i still have more than half the bottle left i only take it when i have a flare up
6539206 i dont have a problem with taking medication for the pain but there are lots of things out there that are just as helpful
6539207 thank god i finally realized pain may be mandatory but suffering is optional
6539208 you have to declare yourself a victim or a survivor and i refuse to let my diseases run my life
6539209 oh how i hate to get up in the mornings
6539210 look stupid you are not on the right track its not continuing our high living economy that is essential it is the survival of the human species

6539215 it is vitally important that all grandparents learn to use the web and technology to stay close to their grandkids
6539216 being tolerant does not mean that i share another ones belief but it does mean that i acknowledge another ones right to believe and obey his own conscience
6539217 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6539218 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
6539219 its one big step forward in improving the safety of fresh produce
6539220 whether in pretense or in truth christ is proclaimed and in that i rejoice
6539221 the preaching of christ is the axis and the whole question of whether one is for and against paul is one of the questions that revolve around it he holds to that axis if he has only more or less confidence in men and their motives he has complete confidence in him who is their lord as well as his and also in the work executed with strange tools by his hand

6539233 the wave of patriotism hitting the airlines lately would be heart warming if not for the fact that all that seems to be motivating them is a desire to avoid any more bad pr

6539244 battlelore is as perfect a fit for ffg as could possibly exist in the marketplace
6539245 needless to say were very excited and proud to include this power title and brand into ffgs family of products previous to today ffg had no fantasy battlefield game a void which we now can fill with this gorgeous industry leader we plan to support this game vigorously even in the very first discussion with eric and richard about this deal there was a flood of exciting ideas for how ffg can expand this game serve its community and move the brand of battlelore forward under the ffg banner
6539246 with its strong resources and superb track record in developing fantasy titles ffg is the perfect partner to take the battlelore game system to the next level in gaming as fans of the game ourselves we are confident it will be in great hands
6539247 is agreement now allows us to focus our resources on providing even more support for the other games in our portfolio as well as successfully launching yet to be announced new games

6539250 our findings provide a basis for opening up new therapeutic approaches to protect neurons from inflammation and toxicity induced neurodegeneration
6539251 selective cox 2 inhibitors were thought to be a promising medicine in treating neurodegenerative diseases stroke cancers and inflammation related diseases like arthritis however the occurrence of a series of cardiovascular complications in patients receiving cox 2 inhibitors has led to their recent withdrawal from the market and limits on their usages our research has shown that the use of endogenous cannabinoid 2 ag may avoid such side effects therefore elevation of endogenous 2 ag levels by facilitating its production inhibiting its decomposition or directly supplying 2 ag may result in treatment advances to prevent the devastation of disorders like stroke alzheimers and traumatic brain injury

6539257 sponges have one of the most ancient lineages and dont have nerve cells
6539258 so we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form
6539259 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
6539260 what we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves or what may be called the nerves ancestor the proto neuron
6539261 we found sets of these genes in sponges when we really didnt expect it
6539262 the significance of our study is that it identifies smurf1 as the signaling partner through which tnf does damage in ra related bone loss
6539263 that has enabled researchers to begin designing small molecule drugs to shut down the action of smurf 1 and its relatives furthermore since mice engineered to have less smurf1 expression develop thicker bones future drugs that shut down smurf1 may be also useful against more common forms of osteoporosis simply by changing the dose of course this is early stage work with many obstacles ahead but it is exciting nonetheless

6539290 they are looking very settled and building permanent structures they are giving no indication that they are going to move
6539291 certainly here on the road we have seen lots of russian military personnel
6539292 by monday most of the equipment will be in place especially the armoured vehicles we will have our staff here we will have our operational centre set and we can start sending out monitors into various parts in georgia and adjacent to south ossetia
6539293 we understand the essence of the russian position and its military response we believe russia was responding to the georgian provocation

6539295 tough choices about what programs to cut and which agencies not to cut rather than taking the easy way out by cutting across the board
6539296 i find it very interesting that the governors budget bottom line in state dollars was 61 million more than the final budget passed by the general assembly
6539297 the budget and control board voted to impose an across the board midyear budget cut because the courts have ruled that is the only way such cuts can be implemented without legislative action
6539298 it would be premature and a waste of time and taxpayer money for the legislature to return to columbia to deal with a budget shortfall at this time
6539299 we need more than two months of a fiscal year to know what the budget picture will look like
6539300 the only thing we do know is that the current round of cuts will not cripple any agency
6539301 i find it interesting that the governor came to florence with a complaint but he did not tell you how he would cut the budget
6539302 when we convene in january we will have a much clearer picture of what we need to do and i am sure the legislature will do whatever is necessary to keep funding vital services while maintaining a balanced budget
6539303 all problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection but that usually will create another problem

6539307 i wanted a less metropolitan look than what other towns are going with these days
6539308 i moved to weston in 1972 with my family i remember the first weeks of the new police department prior to that we had a resident state trooper with constables so i am proud of when the independent department was established

6539324 you feel a sensation of pride because youre of korean descendant just like them

6539342 we need to relieve the burden on the va from routine health care
6539343 if you have a routine health care need take it wherever you want whatever doctor or health care provider and get the treatment you need while we at the va focus our attention our care our love on these grievous wounds of war
6539344 received consistently better care across the board including screening diagnosis treatment and follow up
6539345 ideologues like john mccain and george bush hate the fact that the va exists
6539346 they hate the fact that theres a functional example out there of the government providing better care at a lower cost than the private sector
6539347 the problem that the va faces now is that the bush administration failed to hire enough doctors and disability claims adjusters when they chose to go to war with iraq if these doctors had been hired the va would be an example of the government doing good work bush and mccain dont want the public to see that
6539348 if im driving a humvee in iraq and a roadside bomb explodes and i veer off the road and crush my arm and end up losing it and needing a prosthetic is that a combat wound according to sen mccain

6539376 there is no more fundamental way to support the health of the collision repair industry than to support the secondary and post secondary education system that feeds the industry

6539378 i find the ethical considerations of supervised injections to be profoundly disturbing
6539379 the supervised injection site undercuts the ethic of medical practice and sets a debilitating example for all physicians and nurses both present and future in canada who might begin to question whether its all right to allow someone to overdose under their care

6539386 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6539387 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6539388 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6539389 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6539390 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6539391 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6539392 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6539393 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6539394 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6539395 i cant imagine a world without genes larger than life presence
6539396 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6539397 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6539398 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6539399 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6539400 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union
6539401 he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players playing alongside of gene was an honor and a privilege he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams
6539402 the reality is the cap isnt going anyplace and therefore wisdom says they will look at some compromise that will succeed
6539403 and the assembly has certainly given them a blueprint for that compromise

6539446 amazing really to think that it was all done with words on paper and that it all started back in the swinging sixties i certainly had no idea things would turn out this way
6539447 it would be nice to live out of town but even there i keep thinking im going to look out one morning and find half the east european workforce camped out in the paddock barbecuing someones shetland pony

6539451 perhaps living in thailand has made me a bit cynical
6539452 yes i suppose i was these days im more like world weary ive become totally fatalistic i think i dont feel as though ive ever had much control over events
6539453 well none of us do really except in small ways we make decisions in our lives or we think we do what to have for breakfast and so on but the big stuff is sort of pre ordained i reckon
6539454 perhaps it wasnt supposed to be around this long look at the rich old rockers theyre up there with the gods to all intents and purposes on top of the world now theyre just trying to coming to terms with the aging process another thing i cant believe the stuff the kids are listening to its downright nasty but i guess thats the point im not supposed to like it been there done that offend your parents the funny thing is i know exactly whats going on and the kids know i know its weird almost makes me believe in karma

6539471 one of the key reasons for the success of the chevrolet cobalt and pontiac g5 is the lordstown workforce and the strong partnerships with the uaw and local and state officials
6539472 based on the quality of work and these strong partnerships we are pleased to announce our plans to invest another 500 million in the chevy cruze product program in the u s including more than 350 million in lordstown
6539473 the cruze will build on the already successful chevrolet cobalt cobalt xfe and cobalt ss all of which are nearly sold out in dealer showrooms
6539474 our dealers are asking for many more cobalts than we can build
6539475 the chevrolet cruze was designed and engineered by our global teams in europe and asia pacific and will be manufactured in those regions in addition to the assembly plant here in lordstown ohio
6539476 our goal for the chevrolet cruze is to lead in fuel economy in this very competitive car segment
6539477 we need any witnesses to come forward so that a report can be put before the coroner to determine the next course of action

6539530 many people have died because of russias use of cluster munitions in georgia even as moscow denied it had used this barbaric weapon
6539531 many more people could be killed or wounded unless russia allows professional demining organizations to enter at once to clean the affected areas
6539532 highly dangerous unexploded bomblets now litter farms roads and pathways in shindisi and pkhvenisi
6539533 people remaining in these areas dont realize the dangers these submunitions pose and are at serious risk of injury or death if they handle or even approach the bomblets
6539534 we did not use cluster bombs and whats more there was absolutely no necessity to do so
6539535 we were playing with them as were the georgian soldiers
6539536 it was only when one of the bombs exploded after a soldier threw it that we understood that they were dangerous

6539555 the other thing im figuring out is that its sometimes easier to follow a routine even though part of the reason i went
6539556 i remember feeling nostalgic for that sometimes when i went part time at my job in chicago before taking the big plunge to leave completely and i think this time around i just imposed a routine where none really needed to be simply because i wasnt prepared to think about whether it was time to make bigger changes or was just tired of having to make a conscious decision every day about how i wanted to spend my time im still not quite ready to field the question of whether i need want bigger changes but im working toward it and being ill took me right out of my mindless routine and left me with time for those questions to start to creep into my consciousness

6539561 when the taliban was in power it was illegal for girls to go to school but we never forgot how important it is to educate all afghan children this school used to be housing for russian pilots but the government of afghanistan helped us make it usable as a place of education
6539562 a lot of families cant even afford to buy paper or a pen for their children
6539563 we dont have a lot of money but i see a bright future for schools in this area what matters most is the students are interested in studying and learning and the people here see the value in education
6539564 in terms of preparing them for the world we need to redefine our attitudes towards traditional ideas of cheating
6539565 unless the students have a conceptual understanding of the topic or what they are working on they cant access bits and pieces of information to support them in a task effectively in their working lives they will never need to carry enormous amounts of information around in their heads what they will need to do is access information from all their sources quickly and they will need to check the reliability of their information

6539642 if you look at the numbers the average us household belongs to 12 different loyalty programs but they only use about a third of them

6539722 advertising is not just a cost it actually returns things to the state that the state can use
6539723 its difficult for us to get on the list when a company is looking to locate in a new place it is mainly because of the image problem
6539724 we made the list because of our attractive incentive we were one of 20 locations in three months they narrowed the list we were aggressive and timely and we were one of those where they visited once they visited us they were blown away
6539725 i looked at it as an image investment because hewlett packard coming to arkansas is not the usual thing it changes our image in the technology world
6539726 eriks strategic account leadership and ability to build world class teams are the primary reasons we brought him on board
6539727 we expect that hell focus his teams on delivering exceptional results for our clients
6539728 what is this you have done to me now then here is your wife take her and go
6539729 our job in this election is not just win although im a big believer in winning
6539730 i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against
6539731 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
6539732 w re nicht der massaker von dir yasin so w rden die pal stinenser nie ihren boden verlassen und es uns berlassen
6539733 something like this technology could be embedded in tables and work surfaces
6539734 so as soon as you put down an appropriately equipped device it would immediately begin drawing power
6539735 youd just drop your espresso maker down on them and you would never have to plug it in
6539736 from intels position that seems like the thing to shoot for right now
6539737 it could be that cellphones and pdas are even more compelling but i think we are going to start with the laptop its easy to dial down from laptops
6539738 gavin if youre going to be governor youve got to pull a jed bartlet
6539739 i dont know if it was the nickel drinks at club x or the band attracting the fans
6539740 but it was something new something different after the club x days bands starting coming out of the woodwork
6539741 to use your exact wording so i thought id give it all the attention it required no no dont thank me it was
6539742 we havent received any notice of the lawsuit and therefore are not in a position to comment at this time
6539743 its amazing cant even describe it dream come true all the cliches its something youve been dreaming about forever that finally is here
6539744 they gave us some troubles they got in behind us a couple of times but hope solo the u s goalkeeper came up big a couple of times and it was just our day
6539745 although comcast asserts that its conduct is necessary to ease network congestion we conclude that the companys discriminatory and arbitrary practice unduly squelches the dynamic benefits of an open and accessible internet and does not constitute reasonable network management
6539746 i havent talked to or seen him in years i think he found god or something and may be a preacher if you can imagine that
6539747 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6539748 im on the fence about whether i want to volunteer at one of those free bike stations that will be in town during the convention
6539749 it took a private organization relying primarily on private donations to turn things around
6539750 there is no guarantee that private investment will always be wiser than public
6539751 outsourcing government is popular among elected officials because theyve found a away to assuage their constituents misguided mistrust of government a mistrust engendered by years of conservative yelping about welfare queens and lazy bureaucrats by enriching their friends through lucrative government contracts
6539752 gt hello we have not received any news yet please check your monybookers and make the payment asap your application is under process according your confirmaton and costly for us we need to report your case to the mfa if you will not pay asap
6539753 you could have rock hard abs but not in the way youd expected
6539754 i think we now have very convincing evidence that prdm16 can turn cells into brown fat cells with the possibility of combating obesity
6539755 new role of bone morphogenetic protein 7 in brown adipogenesis and energy expenditure
6539756 a secret society of bicycles who transform into kids and back again
6539757 a conversation with ford motor company president and ceo alan mulally
6539758 damn they got their device to actually work while are remote sucks wait lets sue them for successfully developing the device we couldnt hurray for thinking and the inablility to follow through on those ideas
6539759 but it might be premature to say that we have seen the bottom as the markets focus could revert very quickly to demand deterioration
6539760 as prices drop saudi arabia may cut back on its recent increase in production which could halt the most recent price decline
6539761 if i were designing a system from scratch i would probably go ahead with a single payer system
6539762 youve got a whole system of institutions that have been set up
6539763 people dont have time to wait they need relief now so my attitude is lets build up the system we got lets make it more efficient we may be over time as we make the system more efficient and everybodys covered decide that there are other ways for us to provide care more effectively
6539764 saying it would cover everyone take the profit out of health insurance and allow for greater efficiencies
6539765 republicans cringe at such deep government involvement in the private sector calling it socialized medicine
6539766 even though the nation is just three months away from electing a new president not nearly as much attention has been focused on health care reform as it deserves
6539767 harry and louise were effective in shooting down the clinton plan raising fears about government red tape
6539768 be as effective in prodding the nation to get sensible health care reform done
6539769 has focused too much on tax regimes and not enough on the real challenge health care
6539770 when it comes to domestic nonmilitary fiscal policy in the new millennium everything is dwarfed by health care
6539771 crucial long term fiscal problem facing the u s and its aging population is health care spending
6539772 what happens to taxes will largely be shaped by changes in the health insurance market
6539773 health care spending in the u s by both public and private sources is expected to expand from 16 of gdp to 40 of gdp in 2040
6539774 the pressure to reform americas broken down balkanized health care system isnt going to disappear
6539775 follow that debate and youll come to grips with what really matters when it comes to taxes and budget deficits

6539777 progress and prospects on water for a clean and healthy world
6539778 ive been through a really rough time in my life and it made the person i am today and made me dive like this
6539779 a dive lasts two seconds and its maybe in total from the start to getting in the water its maybe 10 seconds
6539780 you need to be focused that 10 seconds but in between those 10 seconds you dont need to spend energy its being focused at the right time and not having to be focused at others
6539781 i lost a few pounds not much three or four but i think it made a big difference for me today
6539782 i was a little lighter so it was a little easier for me to make the dives
6539783 she does what she has to do but sometimes shell take the path of least resistance too and weve seen that
6539784 thats why ive felt with her not competing synchro she was going to put everything she had into this event we didnt know how she was going to stand up to the pressure of the event itself and obviously she did
6539785 a lot daily work day by day hour by hour
6539786 i think i just grew up and i think im more mature than i was before
6539787 that helped a lot but i worked a lot on the head part and belief in myself
6539788 even to us were with her every day for years and years shes still an enigma to us
6539789 we dont sort of know what really makes her smile and what doesnt shes so unique and such an individual we just try to go along for the ride as best we can
6539790 overall we know were capable of more but still you want to have a lot of darts to throw at the board and hope a couple hit bullseye
6539791 ill feel it more when i go home and or when i think about it in a few days
6539792 to live life is not always a walk through the meadow

6539797 we would just go crazy it turned into something it wasnt just going to any old nightclub to see any old band it was a full on rock show two hours straight
6539798 we helped get other bands on the bill and some exposure
6539799 there werent a lot of bands back then so any help was appreciated
6539800 the valleys not like bigger cities where its easy to replace members
6539801 but its ok cause we all know each other and get along man weve had some good times
6539802 it would be awesome for someone to put on a show with all these bands again
6539803 even if it were just a jam session to have fun
6539804 i messed with kim a while ago she licked on my balls before the deal when they werent worth much she licked my balls once and now shes a star i got some advice for all aspiring women journalists it may not make the best sellers list but lick my balls and you are on the road to the riches
6539805 dont blame me i voted for insert name of some random 3rd party candidate here

6539813 with all the hype of the actual convention and all the obama fans gathered in one spot were going to get beyond the glitz and the celebrity and talk about the facts of his record
6539814 its his week and were just going to try to get into the stories as much as we can
6539815 well have a full scale operation in minneapolis to make sure voters in the twin cities and across the country know that john mccain is promising more of the same failed out of touch agenda
6539816 lets just say you wont have to look too hard to find us in minneapolis
6539817 not ready 08 a mile high and an inch deep
6539818 because paladin live analyzes and diagnoses data center power infrastructure in real time every second and down to the smallest detail it presents facility operators with a wealth of vital information about system health reliability capacity and energy efficiency to guide facility planning
6539819 by pulling the data values needed to calculate energy utilization and presenting that data in the manner specified by the green grids pue and dcie requirements paladin live is the first commercial software product to present this crucial operating information automatically and provides the ability to project or see how changes will effect these critical metrics
6539820 pue and dcie create a common reference point that make it possible for data center operators to start making important assessments of their facilities as well as their going forward strategies for reducing energy usage
6539821 imagine trying to calculate the mpg for your car or just knowing how many miles you have left before you run out of gas without gauges to tell you how much gas you started with how big your gas tank is your speed or how far youve driven pue and dcie provide values for the variables that until now kept data center operators largely in the dark about their energy efficiency
6539822 we know now that the finds in the ice are the oldest of their kind in the alps
6539823 we think this person had an accident but theres been no trace of the person up to now
6539824 theres still a small chance that theres a corpse in the ice but all the neolithic objects were found rather far from the remaining ice patch so the probability of finding a body is very low but it can still happen
6539825 were seeing preserved organic material for the first time and thats whats exciting about the work going on here in switzerland
6539826 in north america archaeologists are typically working on stone tools which gives a very limited picture of the past
6539827 but with material preserved in the ice we get tremendous organic information that previously hadnt been available so youre able to do things like dna research and chemical analysis of different kinds of things that previously hadnt been found so its opened many new chapters into research of the past
6539828 they have made for the most precise reconstruction of glacier variations in the alps in the prehistoric period
6539829 since leather disintegrates when exposed to the sun and wind we can say that at least at this site over a period of 6 000 years the glaciers were never smaller than they were in 2003 when the first finds were made
6539830 valais is one of the most glaciated parts of the alps with the highest summits and the glaciers are receding very fast
6539831 perhaps there are some very high passes that were used by people in the past but we dont know
6539832 a heart is not judged by how much you love but by how much you are loved by others
6539833 is warning the public through standard food recall not to serve or consume specified lots of ready to eat deli meats because of possible contamination with the bacterium
6539834 killing large swaths of sea life and causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damage
6539835 there are now 405 identified dead zones worldwide up from 49 in the 1960s
6539836 gigantic experiment i think with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
6539837 the only issue thats more severe than this would be the idea that an islamic fundamentalist would get his hands on a nuclear weapon and use it against us
6539838 beyond that theres nothing thats more severe this issue represents the potential fiscal meltdown of this nation
6539839 i was concerned about my overall toning down by my vagina
6539840 its sex and its also for me i just wanted to feel strong down there
6539841 if there are 20 year olds who are healthy i think exercise is a good thing
6539842 we just cant tell them that if they do that they will not have urinary incontinence in the future
6539843 its always nice to come back to where you played and had so much success its always been a big part of my life at the u its nice to come back and see the old guys and old coaches and train and skate with them its definitely nice to have
6539844 in years past we always worked out together but skated somewhere else so we just figured hey why not work out get a good group together and skate here and have it all at once i think its working out great
6539845 i feel great i think the workouts are great and theyre benefitting us being on the ice here and skating every day practicing and having a good quality scrimmage afterwards really gets you where you need to be
6539846 i know for some of the guys who live up in canada or even up in buffalo theres a few who seem to do the same thing but i feel like weve got 20 25 quality guys here at minnesota who play pro in europe ahl or nhl we have a high level of competition thats not easy to get
6539847 i still follow after every weekend and check up how they did and how theyre doing i think theyve got a lot of good guys coming in i think theyll be young i think its going to take them a little while to get adjusted to college life and college hockey but i think by the end of the year theyll be up there just like they are every year
6539848 what were seeing is a bit of a belated catch up in canada to the surge in global food prices we saw earlier this year
6539849 because even with the pullback in grain prices theyre still well up from a year ago
6539850 some of that strength in grain prices earlier this year was for real
6539851 partly its just a matter of food companies making sure that its not just a fluke thats going to be quickly reversed
6539852 grain prices make up only a small share about two per cent of the actual final food price
6539853 unfortunately canadians are going to be experiencing continued pressure on food prices in the future
6539854 earlier this year we were faced by just some astronomical unprecedented commodity price increases
6539855 weve seen some relief in the area of wheat pricing its only double what it was last year versus being triple or quadruple the price
6539856 we are big users of both electricity and natural gas as well as producing a fresh product our industry has trucks on the road everyday delivering
6539857 when you look at energy in total theres been significant pressure on all forms of energy but the most acute of late has been transportation costs
6539858 packaging if its plastic its petroleum based so theres been pressures there
6539859 were starting to see the results of all those inflationary price pressures materialize at the retail level
6539860 mind you we still have an incredibly incredibly competitive retail environment
6539861 so just how much of that pressure will materialize at the retail level thats something for the market to decide
6539862 its possible that some of the grain prices we saw earlier this year were in bubble territory
6539863 is that even with a short pullback theyre still in some cases double where they were a year ago
6539864 were faced with on the agriculture side increasing demand worldwide and significant challenges with supply so prices go up
6539865 well demand continues to be strong and we continue to have some challenges on supply then pricing will remain strong
6539866 i thought you were going to finally get it cut before the ball
6539867 ive been a bit busy and preoccupied martha i cant be perfect little johnny all the time
6539868 last thing the world needs to see is me in a suit and tie
6539869 do you remember that first night i tied you up
6539870 i was thinking that perhaps you might be able to use that tie tonight after the ball to tie me up perhaps you could work out some of your frustrations on me
6539871 i think we both need to get rid of some tension dont you think
6539872 now john i know for a fact you have the patterson surgery this morning and you need to leave for that very soon
6539873 you barely have enough time to shave and shower as it is
6539874 got to get that shower taken care of havent i perfect johnny cant be late to work or the whole world might end
6539875 ill be in the kitchen making myself some breakfast if you want to talk
6539876 its okay im not angry a little overwhelmed by all this but not angry
6539877 you dont deserve me being like this to you being this monster i really dont want to make you leave i dont know what i would do if i ran you off
6539878 john youre fighting a strong addiction and dealing with a lot of stress at work right now at the same time its hard but i know you dont mean to be this way
6539879 its just that it feels like i keep watching myself doing and saying such awful things and i cant stop myself i only wanted to be healthier to take care of myself now that i have something someone that makes me want to treat myself better that i used to i never wanted this
6539880 im going to make an appointment with dr reynolds who ive heard volunteers for a helpline for smokers to discuss some medicinal options i can possibly use i hope that i can perhaps get some more information about what nicotinic receptor antagonists or nicotinic receptor partial agonists are available to me and what he would suggest
6539881 no i think i shouldve listened to my doctor dr jones in the first place and not been such a obstinate bastard
6539882 was able to take a break at work and thought id drop by and see if you wanted lunch with me
6539883 oh and these are for you i thought a sunny day called for sunflowers plus i hoped they might help toward making up for this morning or this whole week actually
6539884 there are certainly other things id rather be doing with my mouth but im here to take you to lunch and so i shall
6539885 but that doesnt mean im not thinking up all sorts of punishments for you for teasing me all morning
6539886 you like the dress then i thought it would be a great surprise tish picked it out said she was sure that youd love it
6539887 yes id have to agree with tish in fact i think i might buy her a nice bottle of wine or something as a thank you gift
6539888 the funny thing is i can completely see you doing that thanks tish for marthas fuck me dress or something equally as naughty
6539889 now what was this about using my tie with you tonight
6539890 i was thinking you could use it to tie me up and work out some of your frustrations from the week
6539891 true but theres been the promise of you and a tie specifically since oh months ago when i tied you up for the first time with the sash from your dressing gown
6539892 and how convenient that you have a strapless dress on so i can tie you up right now without undressing you first
6539893 oh so youre going to be willful in your submission to me tonight does that mean ill need to break you
6539894 id like to see you try one of the deadliest men in the universe couldnt break me so i doubt that you can
6539895 are you just going to stare at me all night or do something
6539896 i think my first step in breaking you shall be leaving you alone in here a bit so that you can meditate on how disobedient youve been acting
6539897 i think i might go and make myself a sandwich perhaps watch a dvd or two
6539898 again maybe this will help you rethink how disobedient youve been acting and maybe it will help you finally behave
6539899 id like to know what your funky lymphatic system makes of those imperfections
6539900 im right here tell me what you need im right here
6539901 the mayflies are gone martha i assure you you are okay
6539902 the pharm tied up i was so scared so scared
6539903 no martha i triggered you i need to get you out of this
6539904 i cant let this memory haunt me especially on nights like this where id hoped wed enjoy ourselves with your tie
6539905 martha we dont need to keep playing with the tie we can
6539906 okay what if you control me learn that you can stay in control even if you are tied up
6539907 but we were supposed to be working out your frustrations
6539908 well first of all i care too much about you to not have any problems with easily setting aside those desires to help you instead secondly i think youve distracted me quite well at the moment which goes a lot toward my frustration relief i must say and finally im honestly a bit overwhelmed with all that im juggling at the moment so i think giving up control will do me some good as well
6539909 i want to remember what it feels like to enjoy being tied up again
6539910 i think so im starting to get a bit sore
6539911 i love you i love you i love you i love you
6539912 kami kecewa dengan tiago karena dia sudah menolak tawaran kami untuk pindah
6539913 dia seharusnya sudah pindah ke tottenham januari lalu tapi dia menolaknya sekarang dia juga menolak bergabung dengan everton yang jelas jelas menginginkannya
6539914 masa depannya semakin suram ini kesempatan terakhirnya dia masih punya kontrak dan hak untuk tinggal di sini tapi kami ingin dia berubah pikiran
6539915 we have conveyed to the government that we will be launching blackberry service enabled handsets on our network and that we will abide by whatever decision is taken over security related concern
6539916 a heart is not judged by how much you love but by how much you are loved by others
6539917 abbiamo visitato i siti che ospiteranno il g8 del 2009 e sono sicuro che offriremo ai capi di stato qualcosa di straordinario i lavori procedono bene non ci sar nessun rinvio nei programmi
6539918 this is a serious subject and its a roomful of serious people who have taken it in that manner certainly there are additional discussions that we will have tomorrow
6539919 but for our part we continue to believe that this is a very important initiative and we remain committed to achieving an outcome that is both a net benefit for the non proliferation regime and that meets indias energy needs
6539920 i think there is a lot of support for this internationally and so i remain optimistic that were going to be able to be successful in this process

6539932 by comlev throughout time internet and network marketing has rapidly changed several years ago internet and network marketing has never been heard of and by the time that it was crystallized it became a really difficult thing to handle there were no such things as speedy communication processes in just a matter of clicking the mouse but today everything has changed that is why in the passing of time the internet and the networking marketing has basically formed an integral part of the business corporation nearly all business owners are seeking the service of the internet and the network marketing procedures to date there is no doubt about the fast revolutionizing of the internet and network marketing through the presence of the video calls email websites and many others the affiliates are therefore earning money the fast and convenient way indeed the advantages in the internet and network marketing have offered so much for the people and in today s internet age so many entrepreneurs are harvesting the output of their endeavors
