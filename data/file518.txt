5180115 official recognition has not brought clarity for insurers insurers see the devil in the long term nature of cfs take for instance a 30 year old city high flier who succumbed aged 30 when earning 75 000 a year he might be in line to get two thirds salary 50 000 over 35 years if the condition never resolved the insurer would be paying out 1 75 million
5180116 renaming the condition cfs and discarding earlier labels including myalgic encephalomyelitis me was helpful
5180117 syndrome implies a range of causes and symptoms rather than a specific reaction to an organism
5180118 sun life financial of canada managing director paul davies thinks the condition could account for as much as ten per cent of claims by value
5180119 norwich unions louise zucchi says this accounts for a considerable part of the gamut of mental illnesses which make up a third of all claims
5180120 friends provident technical claims manager andy parkinson says mental health and chronic fatigue claims comprise round about a quarter of all the claims we have
5180121 we experienced a big rise in the 1990s but in the last 18 months or so its got quieter in 2000 cases accounted for 1 5 per cent of the caseload but increased last year to two per cent according to vallender some claims that formerly might have been classified as chronic fatigue are today examined more thoroughly to this end it is becoming standard practice for insurers to pay for medical interventions such as cognitive behaviour therapy in cfs cases
5180122 a typical rehabilitation programme could be designed to entail exercise in a gym and this might be paid for by the insurer
5180123 sun life financial of canada has co opted the german occupational health company prisma health to help at the insurers basingstoke offices davies says insurers need just such a specialist company the companys exposure to chronic fatigue claims has pushed it into a very proactive approach davies explains we are probably a little more expensive but we have put a lot greater effort into getting people back to work weve been looking at cases that have been on the books a couple of years the crux is that if you did not apply rigorous medical attention and rehab programmes you really would have very long term claims we get prisma to talk to the family and also the partner and prisma will work out a programme to get that persons life back
5180124 prismas assessment costs a significant sum says davies the group insurer could spend 50 000 on one rehabilitation

5180180 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5180181 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5180182 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money

5180189 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5180190 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5180191 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5180192 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5180193 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars

5180197 it is time for america to move and to speak not with boasting and belligerence but with a quiet strength to depend in world affairs not merely on the size of on arsenal but on the nobility of ideas
5180198 it is time for us to take a new look at our own government to strip away the secrecy to expose the unwarranted pressure of lobbyists
5180199 it is time for a nationwide comprehensive health program for all our people
5180200 we can have an american government that does not oppress or spy on its own people but respects our dignity and our privacy and our right to be let alone
5180201 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect that other countries are going to say ok thats not leadership thats not going to happen
5180202 cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like you
5180203 for a candidate claiming the mantle of change mr obamas energy policy might as well have been drafted in the 1970s he supports punitive new windfall profits taxes on big oil which wont do anything for supply as well as at least 10 billion a year in new subsidies for alternative energy technologies which may take years or decades to pan out if they ever do

5180209 there is no meaningful connection between abortion and subsequent psychological disturbances in women
5180210 among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion than if they deliver that pregnancy
5180211 it is when a wanted child is killed or dies that a woman experiences subsequent negative mental consequences
5180212 as far as my own experience goes larger suppliers that have evolved from consolidations are faced with the difficult challenge of truly offering customer oriented solutions we may not be a very large team but we make up for that fact with our high level of flexibility our customers can count on quick competent and reliable service

5180227 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5180228 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5180229 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5180230 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5180231 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5180232 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5180233 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5180234 let me repeat liu xiang will not withdraw unless the pain is unbearable
5180235 after liu xiangs injury i wont bother coming back to the
5180236 when you see the crowd you realize why he had to come out
5180237 his takeoff foot so there is a lot of stress on that area
5180238 in watching warmups we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5180239 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5180240 and will encourage him to come back to the track
5180241 but they will understand when somebody has an accident you cant help it
5180242 the bottom line is we cannot solve a 15 billion deficit without new revenue
5180243 this budget runs the risk of putting california on the brink of bankruptcy
5180244 it is time for democrats to take their heads out of the sand
5180245 what we get instead of real reform is phony reform pushed by our democratic friends
5180246 will do nothing to help us live within our means
5180247 we have to maximize our earnings during this difficult period
5180248 where necessary to ensure we fly aircraft to where we can cover our costs and also make some money
5180249 there is always a dip in the fall but this is more than usual
5180250 international carriers who some thought were insulated from these problems are now facing the same situation as the domestic carriers
5180251 its definitely a threat to the local travel and tourism industry
5180252 whoever is elected president will have the power to fundamentally transform the future of abortion politics
5180253 if he selects tom ridge hes going to inflict a mortal wound on his campaign
5180254 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5180255 one of the things that ive always said is that on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception then and you are consistent in that belief then i cant argue with you on that because that is a core issue of faith for you
5180256 what i can do is say are there ways that we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5180257 the amount being paid to the industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content that we own and control is far too small
5180258 if that does not become the case as far as warner music is concerned we will not license to those games
5180259 ecosystems from which people other than the recording industry have derived the majority of value created
5180260 music publishers see music based games as a growth opportunity in an otherwise struggling music business and theyre trying to grab as much of that growth as they can
5180261 we get the content and they get a financial royalty and the promotion and exposure for their bands
5180262 we hope that our partners in the gaming space appreciate not only the value of their own contributions but also those of the recording artists songwriters record labels and music publishers on which their games are significantly based
5180263 major music labels need to reposition themselves as proactive players in developing digital music businesses rather than victims they have a lot of power
5180264 i wish more people would play i wish i could go back to new york and jam with my friends
5180265 i had a musicians mullet and i played the accordion and no girls where im from do not like the accordion
5180266 in order for an instrument to survive there must be ongoing teaching and performance

5180268 was one of the top 10 entertainers in the country
5180269 he was going to concerts and girls were ripping off their clothes to be with him
5180270 once the beatles hit everyone wanted to play the electric guitar instead
5180271 the instrument is made to accompany itself it doesnt need any other instrument but it does need an owner
5180272 i think it is proper that i first consult all party members and organs before a decision is taken we are convening an urgent national council conference next friday to discuss the cooperation issue
5180273 we dp are not against the cooperation per say butwe must consult especially when it comes to signing and agreeing with the content of the cooperation now and in the future
5180274 this is not the most special game we are going to play this year we have superior tactical nous and the guys only have to stick to our game plan and win back the elgon cup
5180275 last year we surrendered a 19 point advantage and we cannot afford to do the same because we shall have exposed our psychological fragility our only outcry is that the kenyans have booked us into a substandard hotel with poor services but that will not make us lose our focus we will win this for our fans
5180276 there are few late fitness tests to some of our players but this is our chance to win something this year and we must grab it with both hands
5180277 look out for more ps2 cult classics in future following a break for gdc

5180289 i think its being killed by lack of originality most publishers are pushing crappy clones quickly made for little money and thats having a detrimental effect on the public because the public doesnt know what to choose doesnt find any good titles so it tends to go to established known titles and games nintendo games basically

5180296 of a heightened security threat based on credible intelligence reporting
5180297 these reports indicate that the enemies of the people of afghanistan intend to attack civilian military and government targets during afghan independence celebrations
5180298 because they dont have footprint or fingerprint proof they produce a witness who alleges he sold a lot of jewelry for the guy at the time
5180299 it all goes to credibility of the witness and when a like this takes the stand it undermines the states case
5180300 the prosecutor can prove the burglary with physical or circumstantial evidence
5180301 circumstantial evidence can make a very powerful case but it can be difficult
5180302 the trial will not be decided based on his past or all the information and background known about him
5180303 from what i hear there seems to be reasonable doubt everywhere and the state has a very tough row to hoe in this case
5180304 people assume he golder is the bandit because he has done it before but i dont think a jury will convict him simply upon their past if the evidence in the immediate case is not there
5180305 with most burglary cases the conviction comes from direct identification of the perpetrator and you have a reliable competent witness
5180306 what the jury is going to have to realize is that if they have a doubt they have to let somebody go even if they think he is guilty
5180307 liebman can speculate that golder committed the burglaries in a certain way but if he doesnt know he cant just guess
5180308 anything golder said to him about the burglaries is admissible but the likelihood they would convict him on that is slim
5180309 people ask where is the dna or the blood splatter when it is missing often times they will fault the state for not having a sufficient case
5180310 if you throw enough mud against the wall the idea is that some of that has got to stick
5180311 it seems like they have a lot of mud if you can put an accomplice on the stand and other convincing witnesses the jury will start to look askance at the defendant

5180337 the level of growth of repossession orders suggests that we are on track for a repossession crisis very similar to the early 1990s
5180338 it is absolutely vital that the government should intervene and require a proper code of conduct to be implemented by mortgage lenders
5180339 this should not just apply to the big banks but to the large number of secondary lenders who are using court action to pursue their debts in a very aggressive way
5180340 this is the human cost of gordon browns economic incompetence

5180347 you should always do whats right regardless of what others think or tell you to do
5180348 lucky for me i landed on a patch of high grass and mud which gave me a little bit of a cushion i walked away with a chipped elbow
5180349 sometimes maybe i put off making decisions that maybe i should have taken earlier
5180350 to make decisions in the long term interests of the country you have to take quite tough decisions quite early on so that you can get things done within the life of a parliament
5180351 you appoint good people and trust their decisions but you have to know when to step in william hague has helped me because he made all the mistakes the first time round
5180352 if wed have had that election gordon brown would no longer have been prime minister and the conservatives would be the largest party in a hung parliament
5180353 brown compounded calling off the election by then saying it was nothing to do with the polls which was a massive mistake it was a lie and it was treating people like fools
5180354 it was a big roll of the dice no autocue no funny business there was a moment when i lost my train of thought but no one really noticed
5180355 we are where we are now if the court accepts there was a misunderstanding this amount is still outstanding and needs to be paid off

5180370 if a person is known to us or wanted they will sometimes give the details of someone else but this shows us exactly who they are

5180372 it was amazing to win that much the best and worst time of my life in equal measure the most frightening and exciting
5180373 we both said sport was our nemesis and then we get it first question
5180374 its really weird when youre sat there in the studio
5180375 i rang him straight away after the recording to tell him we had won 50 000 he couldnt believe it
5180376 it means so much because all our money for mood swings comes from our own fundraising efforts
5180377 thats why i was so desperate to go on millionaire
5180378 its such a unique charity and we will spend every last penny on things that really matter
5180379 the girls did good im proud of them and the money is absolutely unbelievable
5180380 it was nerve wracking on the end of that phone
5180381 well never raise enough to do all the things we want to do but 25 000 will mean that people in sometimes desperate need will get the help and support they require
5180382 anything that can help towards finding a cure for cancer can only be good
5180383 wordsworths line earth has not anything to show more fair was inspired by a view from which bridge
5180384 after we filmed the show i was down in london and drove over westminster bridge twice
5180385 i rang my dad and said youll never guess where i am looking at the view ill never forget it now
5180386 its also about giving your charity the publicity and raising its profile
5180387 we wanted to enjoy ourselves while also raising money and awareness about what we do
5180388 one of my favourite fun categories in the dog show was the best six legs which included both the dogs and its owners
5180389 it was the first time that we have ever organised a dog show in the city and it was a great success with more than 150 people attending over the afternoon
5180390 the show also enabled us to raise much needed funds for the dogs home while also letting people know about some of the services we offer such as microchipping and neutering
5180391 it has been a fantastic event which has given dog owners the chance to meet and enjoy themselves
5180392 and i also believe that it is a great idea for members of the gay and lesbian community to forge a link with the dogs home in this way
5180393 my sincere hope is that this will now become an annual part of the manchester pride celebrations
5180394 perhaps more embarrassing to prudently financial new labour are the ranks of tramps and malingerers who have escaped into ashworth to avoid working for a living demanding and receiving full board and full benefits of 100 per week pocket money for life we prison transfers receive only 25 being regarded as patients only for restrictions
5180395 cataracts ive had for 10 years are untreated as my visiting an outside hospital would again draw unwanted attention
5180396 quality background havent exercised in the open air since 1975 stopped all social visits since 1998 when ashworth became less than a prison confined to ward for past 23 years force fed since 1999
5180397 in like fashion new labour exploits the threat of a few fertiliser bombs to panic and heard a bovine generation
5180398 as a child i watched german planes daily nightly bomb glasgow back to full employment new labour has accomplished more permanent diminution of human civil liberties than ww2 bombs and rockets
5180399 new labours disregard for human civil rights is now a general contagion with each infliction coated in a syrup of entirely cosmetic safeguards
5180400 ive always done it legally ive painted all around hulme on buildings the council were knocking down
5180401 from that i got a lot of commissions painting a set for eastenders and the beastie boys shop in new york
5180402 just because you own a spray can doesnt mean you are a detriment to society i do a lot of good with my time and ive worked with disabled kids and young offenders
5180403 ive been professional for 16 or 17 years and ive travelled the world ive made up to 20 000 for one commission ive done really well out of it
5180404 manchester is a brand new city and whether its in the city or just outside there should be somewhere people can just paint in front of their friends
5180405 it makes me think that toolbar data is being used

5180455 i am not somebody who promotes same sex marriage but i do believe in civil unions
5180456 why oh why cant we have have a better mainstream press
5180457 i think matts definitely closing the gap theres no doubt about it
5180458 i think hes really been pushing brian here probably about the last eight to 10 days
5180459 i think matt is getting more comfortable brian was more comfortable quicker in the earlier part as far as the otas understanding what were doing i think theyre both good young prospects
5180460 just looking at their grades they did a number of positive things in the game
5180461 they did not have winning performances is the way we look at it and its just a number of things we need to clean up
5180462 ive said it time and time again those guys need to play we knew this was going to take probably the full preseason to get those two guys ready and we feel like were on course to get that done
5180463 the things that always stick out in my mind are mistakes
5180464 i could have made a couple of adjustments on protections that would have helped out and not got me sacked on the first play just the little things reads being quicker with decisions and things like that
5180465 i came in here and i didnt really know what the situation was going to be or what its going to be like at the end of camp its one of those things that i am going to go out and play as hard as i can and just let the coaches do their job
5180466 i look at it like i have an opportunity to come in here and learn how to play the game learn from some great coaches learn from aaron and do the best i can and take advantage of the opportunity
5180467 overall i felt like i did a pretty good job of just the mechanics of the offense getting in and out of the huddle
5180468 most of the time i felt like i went to the right place with the ball obviously there were a few times where i made mistakes and went to the wrong place forced one in there on the first play
5180469 weve kept them the same as far as going through the installation phase
5180470 brian took the reps of the no 2 and matt took the reps of the no 3 based on the period 3 2 1 is the ratio sometimes it was 4 2 1 as far as the starter now once we got into this in season schedule they split the opponent reps and brian is still getting a little more work than matt
5180471 i dont know if you drew it up like this is the way you would do it but this is the way it is
5180472 we like our two young guys and we think they are on a steady path here quite frankly our coaching staff likes working with them so we feel pretty good
5180473 its a little different than punt return but you just have to go out there and use your vision and hopefully the guys up front will open up a hole and the guys did that tonight and made it easy
5180474 whenever you can break tackles and get yards after contact its big and can help the team
5180475 obviously its an opportunity to get on the field and make plays
5180476 id be more than welcome to do it but we have some great guys with blackmon and tramon williams who can do it as well im just going to go out keep doing my job and see what happens
5180477 didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so fucking smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what fuck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
5180478 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight this is true by the way im not just saying that the reasons why this is so will be discussed in an upcoming post i have a feeling that is awesome

5180484 one hour after they drank red bull their blood systems were no longer normal they were abnormal like we would expect in a patient with cardiovascular disease
5180485 the study does not show effects which would go beyond that of drinking a cup of coffee therefore the reported results were to be expected and lie within the normal physiological range
5180486 abi researchs data appears to have been collected just after q1 2008 when demand for blu ray was very high and supplies were low
5180487 because hardware production schedules are arranged many months in advance most player manufacturers needed a fair amount of time to respond to the increased demand my own company
5180488 another factor that must be considered is where we are in the adoption curve for blu ray new publishing formats typically require several years before they can begin to establish themselves in the mass market for comparison purposes i looked back at some old dvd industry newsletters from the end of 1998 roughly the same early point in dvds life that were at now with blu ray and found a couple of analyst quotes that seem short sighted in retrospect one predicted a long and healthy life ahead for vhs another was quoted as saying that dvd hardware sales were slow to take off partly due to consumer confusion
5180489 we can make healthy rice healthy and rich soil that requires no fertilizer and have productive soil without tilling if we just accept the fact that such excessive efforts tilling application of either organic chemical fertilizers or pesticides has never been necessary a farming method that develops the conditions under which people do not have to do anything this is what i have been pursuing after thirty years i finally came to the point where my natural farm could yield without any effort virtually as much rice and wheat as typical scientific farms

5180519 you cant color it and put it in any other light we flat out stunk and from an offensive standpoint theres nothing you can say we flat out were no good
5180520 i had a lot of family and friends here and didnt give them a lot to cheer about thats going to happen sometimes its how your respond to the situation and as an offense we have to respond we have to play a lot better next week
5180521 we need to be honest in our critiques of the film im going to be brutally honest with myself i know i didnt play well tonight and we have to improve
5180522 this is an excellent opportunity for our team to learn from this and ill take full advantage of this opportunity for our football team to learn from this whether its the quarterback free safety defensive linemen throughout our football team
5180523 we need to find that rhythm and figure out what our identity is going to be
5180524 is it going to be spreading teams out is it going to be running the football we just need to get healthy and hopefully have a better performance next week
5180525 i think we were all on different pages and we just have to go and correct it you get knocked down but you have to keep getting up its preseason we fix it and we go on from there
5180526 we didnt get it done on first and second down we allowed them to bring a lot of pressure and we didnt pick up the pressure so they continued to bring it

5180545 can you imagine if we plucked our girls out of their homes when they were 5 or 6 then kept them and trained them never let them go home
5180546 in that just would not happen never wed have a hundred lawyers knocking on our door because it does not work that way for us this system works the best
5180547 its great because seeing the other girls kind of pushes you to work harder when you go home

5180563 i know the academy of national media marketing design and production respects my work and im confident that i will win an award one of these days

5180565 i was completely flabberghasted i planned to attend the annual national media marketing award night for fun and the after parties but lo and behold i walked home with an award for best new analysis and statistical measurement in a national media marketing project

5180593 mendis has really bowled well in the tests and his confidence must be sky high along with muralitharan they form a very potent attack but he is not unplayable and we are working on a gameplan to counter him during the one day series
5180594 we will try and play our natural game against him and see how it goes he does not bowl at 150 kmph so there is no reason to be frightened of him when murali was new to international cricket even he bothered many top batsmen and is still bothering them but with time batsmen learn more and adjust to the situations

5180599 the injury has gone back and forth during his training and rest during the years we arrived at olympic village aug 16 and had an mri and the problem was in his tendon
5180600 since may a lot of people know that he had problems with his hamstring said chinese team coach feng shuyong
5180601 his hamstring problem is gone after that he had very good training for less than two months his form is getting better and better
5180602 everybody expected that liu can do as well as he did four years ago in athens and get another gold medal said feng
5180603 thats the wishes of all chinese people i believe a lot of friends from other countries wanted to see him do the same thing as he did before
5180604 we have done everything possible said feng of the efforts undertaken by doctors and officials to help the hurdler recover
5180605 liu xiang shivered a lot due to great pain if you are injured to a certain degree the pain is almost intolerable i personally witness the whole process and saw how pained liu xiang was

5180810 moreover many medicare beneficiaries will have access to a medicare advantage plan that offers lower prescription drug premiums than a stand alone plan
5180811 we are paying for better outcomes and we are getting higher quality and more value for the medicare dollar

5180860 i dont want to me chriss son i want to be brian smith middle linebacker for notre dame
5180861 i said the first day the guy who is in position to make the most plays is that position inside
5180862 when we went through the spring the guy who was making the majority of the plays on a daily basis was him
5180863 he was bouncing back between an inside linebacker and an outside linebacker you really couldnt get a grasp for which hed be best at
5180864 when you say you are going to play more of that type on the field then his versatility became a huge asset rather than a initially a tough one to figure what are you going to do with him
5180865 because going back to the recruiting process we had viewed him as both an inside and an outside player we knew we would not be putting him in an unnatural position
5180866 we had already seen him playing there and playing at a high level
5180867 unlike some years previous there are some guys slotted in a spot and theyre going to have to get beat out i would have to say hes one of them
5180868 itll be a lot more aggressive this year its going to be fun this year
5180869 in high school they ended up moving me to defensive end because i was an attacking kind of guy and thats why the early stages of me playing linebacker i didnt quite have the drops and the reads so i was just going after whoever had the ball or whoever was around the ball
5180870 they put me at defensive end because i was an attacking kind of guy so this attacking style of defense suits me very well
5180871 im coming here because i grew up a notre dame fan and i wanted to play for notre dame
5180872 of course my dad played here but at the end of the day i want to make a name for myself
5180873 i think he already had a spirit and pride for the place which i think only makes him want to be successful that much more
5180874 i used to love kory minor and watching kory minor play especially because he wore the single digit the number four i wanted number on my back one day and to play for notre dame
5180875 the first casualty who had chest pains was taken by helicopter to daisy hill hospital
5180876 this is a crucial part in helping traffic flow in the city
5180877 this is a step in the process where we want the whole south bay to be synchronized together
5180878 ive got a threesome of girls who are 6 coming up in my first grade class and i expect them to be trouble i have heard they are like little old ladies any ideas for dealing with friendships in class would be helpful moving them and separating them to different classes would be a big deal
5180879 the teacher is no 1 in the classroom she can do all kinds of fun things
5180880 i would not even think about children who are 6 coming into my class being trouble
5180881 just because a previous teacher found the behavior of these students to be challenging doesnt mean a new teacher will also children behave differently in different environments if the mooresville teacher expects trouble thats exactly what shell get
5180882 if this teacher consciously chooses to nurture each childs individual strengths ill bet she finds that they arent really trouble after all
5180883 my advice to the teacher of the threesome is to enjoy the girls as an example of socialization for the rest of the class
5180884 they reminded us of the social life of a bunch of much older girlfriends id bet that they are still friends at 40 and 80
5180885 this is best for the girls and for the entire classroom
5180886 the primary objective of any school is learning social development is important but learning is still the most important objective teachers and principals also realize that you must do what is best for all the students in class and that means not having three friends disrupt the learning process
5180887 my 4 year old daughter whines a lot part of it is just how her voice sounds but it is very annoying how can i get her to stop whining
5180888 inwieweit wir dieses vorhaben in die tat umsetzen k nnen m ssen wir abwarten
5180889 wir haben versucht eine gesunde mischung aus gestandenen und jungen profis zusammenzustellen
5180890 es ist gut eingespielt das k nnte unser gro es plus sein
5180891 das ist nat rlich erstmal ein schock f r uns zumal tobi in der vorbereitung sehr gut gearbeitet hat
5180892 in my mind this rule change is an acknowledgment that regionalism wont happen on its own especially under the current economic conditions
5180893 this will be another opportunity for us to think out of the box and finally turn this concept into a reality
5180894 theres some great financial pressure on ontario airport but this plan could ease that
5180895 i think lax is now in a position to wield a little clout with the carriers who are always asking for favors but never give anything in return
5180896 playing hardball with the airlines can only help ontarios cause
5180897 if you put that reality together along with the large capital improvement program were implementing it would be difficult for lax to support the cost of modernization in addition to continuing to subsidize other airports and business operations
5180898 when the economics of the travel industry gets tough leisure travel takes a hit the fastest but we are actively marketing with air carriers to try to replace flights out of ontario
5180899 however with fuel prices the way they are im not sure we could create a subsidy that would be substantial enough that would make the airlines look at ontario favorably
5180900 even in a robust market the airlines cant make money on those kinds of loads
5180901 i just dont want to be overly optimistic when the numbers arent supporting the project
5180902 this new landing fee rule will have no material impact on the citys efforts to regionalize air service in southern california
5180903 we talked and decided id stick around for a while so im going to stick around for a while
5180904 it takes the pressure off the city council and permits us to find the best possible candidate for the job
5180905 jack is well known well liked respected and trusted by staff members
5180906 i wouldnt say its super common but its not uncommon either especially when youre talking about highly skilled administrators who are in demand
5180907 a lot of people thought oh well youve been around forever no big deal
5180908 its a bigger deal than you think theres a learning curve here im not going to get it all in a real hurry because it takes time
5180909 its a lot of conflict we at the station get calls all the time the bicyclists are upset the motorists are upset
5180910 we have the confluence of more and more cyclists who think theyre in the tour de france using a very narrow windy dangerous road in pack formation at the same time motorists who should be in my view the primary users are using it
5180911 we need to come up with a way to share and not to favor one use over another
5180912 the sign weve got right now is tantamount to saying its open season on cyclists
5180913 i had motorists yelling youre not supposed to be up here
5180914 you get 100 bicyclists together and theyre riding down the road at 25 mph and now you have one vehicle that wants to go 50 and 100 vehicles that want to go 25
5180915 i can only hope that youd have died on some fly blown beach and wont be coming back
5180916 in your column about former presidential candidate john edwards having a mistress you said that our presidents are guarded like national treasures regardless of the other issues which your column raises there is a necessity for the president and for certain presidential candidates to have an extremely high level of security
5180917 your column about john edwards resonated with me i too thought his comments about his egocentric and narcissistic behavior were wonderfully insightful and candid other politicians could follow his lead to our collective benefit and yes i agree that the adulation we shower on these people is contributory but edwards comments were absolutely refreshing i say that as a woman wronged thanks for your lovely observations
5180918 you are so right on this is not something political this is a human condition story and if it were not about a politician it would not be taking up our time and attention i am waiting for those yelling foul the loudest to be next but can you please tell me how we as a nation can stand in moral judgment after hiroshima or how w can condemn actions he himself took by invading iraq digging saddam hussein out of a hole and hanging him in public
5180919 there are two types of men in politics one is the elliot spitzer type who when discovered goes away as they should the other type is the john edwards antonio villaraigosa john mccain types these guys never go away they somehow weather the storm and stay in there these types are reprehensible but i also condemn mrs edwards who knew her husband was not telling the truth when she knew what he had done she is just as bad as he is
5180920 to clarify my disgust with edwards its not the extramarital sex its the lying when first questioned a man with leadership qualities would have said thank you for your interest but thats a matter between my wife and myself his eagerness to toss his alleged mistress under the bus was alarming in fact he should have said something anything nice about her in his mea culpa he certainly cant be called a man
5180921 maybe the news ought to get back to just reporting the facts let the tabloids speculate and pronounce guilt or innocence i think this is why people are tired of newspapers and news period just give us the facts and let the courts make the decisions
5180922 i think that the breeze should clean up its web site and make it more organized i am tired of looking at the same headline on the same page multiple times the paper should also return to local classified listings if i am searching for a job i want a local one the web site suggests that all of l a is nearby when it isnt at all
5180923 be local be family friendly and be fair and accurate i need a paper that i can give to my kids and let them read it so that you have another customer in 10 years i also have a strong mistrust of the internet because i dont believe the facts are checked as carefully as in a newspaper
5180924 there is a basic reason that most newspapers are losing readership and that is the overwhelming left leaning socialist liberal agenda that you and the monopolistic ap keep putting out there what you all apparently dont get is that most americans love this country we are tired of the blame america first crowd that you the democrats obama the ap and so on are a part of i realize that no matter what most of us unwashed say you elitists know better and you just brush aside our ignorant comments nothing said here will alter your basic beliefs but as long as you and your ilk continue to spew your socialist pap you will continue to lose our support
5180925 i buy a newspaper for the professionalism and credibility i assume journalists bring to their craft i respect fact finding and neutrality in politics i need that to make informed decisions personally i dont like things that dont really matter on the front page at the expense of major news buried inside stay in the center or balance a left with a right point of view on the same page or in the same section when it comes to politics your column is a nice balance to the news i need some humor after some of the hard to take news your column keeps me renewing my subscription
5180926 your article is slanted biased opinionated democratic liberal and highly socialist and has no business being included in a paper how come your editors havent noticed your opinions creeping in you are a big disgrace

5180937 i must confess i needed 10 000 for my new church so i only threw in 20 000
5180938 i needed 20 000 for new equipment at the hospital so i only had 10 000 in the envelope
5180939 gentlemen im shocked that you would blatantly ignore this mans final wish i threw in my personal cheque for the full amount
5180940 after catastrophic engine failure i landed long as i had no power the landing gear failed to deploy and no braking was available i bounced over the stone wall at the end of the runway struck the trailer of a truck while crossing the perimeter road crashed through the guardrail grazed a large pine tree ran over a tractor parked in the adjacent field and hit another tree then i lost control
5180941 what you told me is technically correct but of no use to anyone

5180946 it does not matter that you do not want my ties and that you hate me i will show you i am a bigger man than that if you continue over that hill for about five kilometres you will find a lovely restaurant it has all the ice cold water you need
5180947 your filthy swine of a brother they wont let me in without a tie
5180948 im looking for my wife and i guess i wasnt watching where i was going

5180955 allah directs thus about al kalalah quran 4 176 chapter defines how muslims should treat an unbeliever the code of conducts muslims ought to observe when they are dealing someone outside the sphere of their belief system
5180956 in the name of allah beneficent merciful what can be the reason in avoiding it scholars give the reason as this chapter accentuates on god s vengeance and punishment more than any other chapters why should god reveal such a chapter when especially his faithful are met their objectives hudaifat al yaman said to his companions you people call this chapter sura tauba which means chapter of repentance but in fact this is the chapter punishment this chapter hasn t left a single hypocrite unmentioned
5180957 i have let my horse go and thrown down my weapon for the war has ended there is no more fighting then the prophet said to him now the time of fighting has come there will always be a group of my ummah dominant over others allah will turn the hearts of some people away from the truth so they that group will fight against them and allah will bestow on them war spoils from them the enemies until allahs command comes to pass while they are in that state verily the center of the believers abode is ash sham and goodness is tied around the horses foreheads till the day of resurrection also recorded this narration allah then says thus and had allah so willed he could have taken vengeance against them which means that had he so willed he could have taken immediate vengeance against the disbelievers with a chastisement or exemplary punishment directly from him but he lets you struggle so as to test with one another meaning he has ordered jihad and fighting against the enemies in order to try you and test your affairs the interpretation of ibn kathir the most authentic mufassir of quran reveals context argument is fraudulent here in this context a war has just ended and one of the companions of muhammad is relaxed for since the war is ended he doesn t need to fight any more no says muhammad correcting him and if to focus on muhammad s answer to the person who was about to retire its universal appeal can easily be noted there will always be a group in my community muslims dominant over others muhammad s islam is supposed to be dominant over all other faiths and their adherents this notion is flowing out here as muhammad uses the word dominant allah will turn some people away from truth islam so my community of believers will fight them

5180962 miss lilywhites party and the two kittens would compel any child to recite
5180963 as in the cock robin lesson grant that the principle is sound and there is much to be said on both sides of that question but grant it who in the world could get through all the pasting and cutting and general messing preparatory to the great lesson no the method of the books may be only second best but ready made books must do for me i have no time to make my own apparatus
5180964 little pussy as it should be learned will know at least one hundred words not a bad stock in trade for a beginner all of them good useful words that we want every day
5180965 you dont mean to say you would go plump into words of three or four syllables before a child knows his letters
5180966 it is possible to read words without knowing the alphabet as you know a face without singling out its features but we learn not only the names but the sounds of the letters before we begin to read words
5180967 our children learn their letters without any teaching we always keep by us a shallow table drawer the bottom covered half an inch deep with sand before they are two the babies make round o and crooked s and t for tommy and so on with dumpy uncertain little fingers the elder children teach the little ones by way of a game
5180968 the sand is capital we have various devices but none so good as that children love to be doing the funny shaky lines the little finger makes in the sand will be ten times as interesting as the shapes the eye sees
5180969 but the reading i cant get over three syllables in the first lesson why its like teaching a twelve months old child to waltz
5180970 you say that because we forget that a group of letters is no more than the sign of a word while a word is only the vocal sign of a thing or an act this is how the child learns first he gets the notion of the table he sees several tables he finds they have legs by which you can scramble up very often covers which you may pull off and on them many things lie good and pleasant for a baby to enjoy sometimes too you can pull these things off the table and they go down with a bang which is nice the grown up people call this pleasant thing full of many interests table and by and by baby says table too and the word table comes to mean in a vague way all this to him around table on the table and so on form part of the idea of table to him in the same way baby chimes in when his mother sings she says baby sing and by and by notions of sing kiss love dawn on his brain
5180971 yes the darlings and its surprising how many words a child knows even before he can speak them pussy dolly carriage soon convey interesting ideas to him
5180972 thats just it interest the child in the thing and he soon learns the sound sign for it that is its name now i maintain that when he is a little older he should learn the form sign that is the printed word on the same principle it is far easier for a child to read plum pudding than to read to to because plum pudding conveys a far more interesting idea
5180973 that may be but when he gets into words of three or four syllables but what would you do while hes in words of one syllable indeed of two or three letters
5180974 i should never put him into words of one syllable at all the bigger the word the more striking the look of it and therefore the easier it is to read provided always that the idea it conveys is interesting to a child it is sad to see an intelligent child toiling over a reading lesson infinitely below his capacity ath eth ith oth uth or at the very best the cat sat on the mat how should we like to begin to read german for example by toiling over all conceivable combinations of letters arranged on no principle but similarity of sound or worse still that our readings should be graduated according to the number of letters each word contains we should be lost in a hopeless fog before a page of words of three letters all drearily like one another with no distinctive features for the eye to seize upon but the child oh well children are different no doubt it is good for the child to grind in this mill but this is only one of many ways in which children are needlessly and cruelly oppressed
5180975 you are taking high moral ground all the same i dont think i am convinced it is far easier for a child to spell cat cat than to spell plum pudding plum pudding
5180976 but spelling and reading are two things you must learn to spell in order to write words not to read them a child is droning over a reading lesson spells c o u g h you say cough and she repeats by dint of repetition she learns at last to associate the look of the word with the sound and says cough without spelling it and you think she has arrived at cough through c o u g h not a bit of it c o f spells cough
5180977 yes but cough has a silent u and a gh with the sound of f there i grant is a great difficulty if only there were no silent letters and if all letters had always the same sound we should indeed have reading made easy the phonetic people have something to say for themselves
5180978 you would agree with the writer of an article in a number of a leading review plough ought to be written and printed plow through thru enough enuf ought aut or ort and so on all this goes on the mistaken idea that in reading we look at the letters which compose a word think of their sounds combine these and form the word we do nothing of the kind we accept a word written or printed simply as the symbol of a word we are accustomed to say if the word is new to us we may try to make something of the letters but we know so well that this is a shot in the dark that we are careful not to say the new word until we have heard someone else say it
5180979 children are the same only more so we could if we liked break up a word into its sounds or put certain sounds together to make a word but these are efforts beyond the range of children first as last they learn to know a word by the look of it and the more striking it looks the easier it is to recognise provided always that the printed word is one which they already know very well by sound and by sense
5180980 it is not clear yet suppose you tell me step by step how you would give your first reading lesson an illustration helps so much
5180981 very well bobbie had his first lesson yesterday on his sixth birthday the lesson was part of the celebration by the way i think its rather a good idea to begin a new study with a child on his birthday or some great day he begins by thinking the new study a privilege
5180982 that is a hit but go on did bobbie know his letters
5180983 yes he had picked them up as you say but i had been careful not to allow any small readings
5180984 then the words in the box are scattered on the table and he finds half a dozen cock robins with great ease we do the same thing with sparrow arrow said killed who and so on till all the words in the verse have been learned the words on the black board grow into a column which bob reads backwards and forwards and every way except as the words run in the verse then bobbie arranges the loose words into columns like that on the board then into columns of his own devising which he reads off lastly culminating joy the whole lesson has been a delight he finds among the loose words at my dictation who killed cock robin i said the sparrow with my bow and arrow i killed cock robin arranging the words in verse form then i had still one unmutilated copy out of which bob had the pleasure of reading the verse and he read it forwards and backwards so long as he lives he will know those twelve words
5180985 no doubt it was a pleasant lesson but think of all the pasting and cutting
5180986 yes that is troublesome i wish some publisher would provide us with what we want nursery rhymes in good bold type with boxes of loose words to match a separate box or division for each page so that the child may not be confused by having too many words to hunt amongst the point is that he should see and look at the new word many times so that its shape becomes impressed upon his brain
5180987 i see but he is only able to read cock robin he has no general power of reading
5180988 on the contrary he will read those twelve words wherever he meets with them suppose he learns ten words a day in half a year he will have at least six hundred words he will know how to read a little
5180989 excellent supposing your children remember all they learn at the end of a week mine would remember cock robin perhaps but it the rest would be gone
5180990 oh but we keep what we get when we have mastered the words of the second verse bob runs through the first in the book naming words here and there as i point to them it takes less than a minute and the ground is secured
5180991 im sorry to say it lasted half an hour the childs interest tempted me to do more than i should
5180992 it all sounds very attractive a sort of game but i cannot be satisfied that a child should learn to read without knowing the powers of the letters you constantly see a child spell a word over to himself and then pronounce it the more so if he has been carefully taught the sounds of the letters not merely their names
5180993 naturally for though many of our english words are each a law unto itself others offer a key to a whole group as arrow gives us sp arrow m arrow h arrow but we have alternate days one for reading the other for word building and that is one way to secure variety and so the joyous interest which is the real secret of success

5181050 the power of asking for what you want jimmys secret
5181051 human life is sacred because from its beginning it involves the creative action of god and it remains for ever in a special relationship with the creator who is its sole end
5181052 when you hearken to the voice of the lord your god all these blessings will come upon you and overwhelm you may you be blessed in the city and blessed in the country the produce of your soil and the offspring of your livestock the issue of your herds and the young of your flocks blessed be your grain bin and your kneading bowl may you be blessed in your coming in and blessed in your going out
5181053 as for the son you will conceive and bear no razor shall touch his head for this boy is to be consecrated to god from the womb
5181054 did not he who made me in the womb make him did not the same one fashion us before our birth
5181055 truly you have formed my inmost being you knit me in my mothers womb
5181056 beloved of his people dear to his maker dedicated from his mothers womb consecrated to the lord as a prophet was samuel the judge and priest
5181057 hear me o coastlands listen o distant peoples the lord called me from birth from my mothers womb he gave me my name he made of me sharp edged sword and concealed me in the shadow of his arms he made me a polished arrow in his quiver he hid me you are my servant he said to me israel through whom i show my glory though i thought i had toiled in vain and for nothing uselessly spent my strength yet my reward is with the lord my recompense is with my god for now the lord has spoken who formed me as his servant from the womb that jacob may be brought back to him and israel gathered to him and i am made glorious in the sight of the lord and my god is now my strength

5181059 you shall not procure abortion you shall not destroy the newborn child
5181060 where they are already the object of the care of divine providence
5181061 to prevent birth is anticipated murder it makes little difference whether one destroys a life already born or does away with it in its nascent stage the one who will be man is already one
5181062 depart from me because i was hungry and you did not feed me i was thirsty and you did not give me to drink i was sick and you did not visit me
5181063 when did we see you hungry or thirsty or sick and did not come to your help
5181064 whatever you neglected to do unto one of these least of these you neglected to do unto me
5181065 my peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you
5181066 whatever you did to the least of these you did to me and he will also say to those on his left whatever you neglected to do for the least of these you neglected to do it for me
5181067 and see this neglect to love brings spiritual poverty maybe in our own family we have somebody who is feeling lonely who is feeling sick who is feeling worried are we there are we willing to give until it hurts in order to be with our families or do we put our own interests first these are the questions we must ask ourselves especially as we begin this year of the family we must remember that love begins at home and we must also remember that the future of humanity passes through the family i was surprised in the west to see so many young boys and girls given to drugs and i tried to find out why why is it like that when those in the west have so many more things than those in the east and the answer was because there is no one in the family to receive them our children depend on us for everything their health their nutrition their security their coming to know and love god for all of this they look to us with trust hope and expectation but often father and mother are so busy they have no time for their children or perhaps they are not even married or have given up on their marriage so their children go to the streets and get involved in drugs or other things we are talking of love of the child which is were love and peace must begin these are the things that greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion because it is a war against the child a direct killing of the innocent child murder by the mother herself and if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child how can we tell other people not to kill one another how do we persuade a woman not to have an abortion as always we must persuade her with love and we remind ourselves that love means to be willing to give until it hurts jesus gave even his life to love us so the mother who is thinking of abortion should be helped to love that is to give until it hurts her plans or her free time to respect the life of her child the father of that child whoever he is must also give until it hurts by abortion the mother does not learn to love but kills even her own child to solve her problems and by abortion that father is told that he does not have to take any responsibility at all for the child he has brought into the world the father is likely to put other women into the same trouble so abortion just leads to more abortion any country that accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love but to use any violence to get what they want this is why the greatest destroyer of love and peace is abortion many people are very very concerned with the children of india with the children of africa where quite a few die of hunger and so on many people are also concerned about all the violence in this great country of the united states these concerns are very good but often these same people are not concerned with the millions who are being killed by the deliberate decision of their own mothers and this is what is the greatest destroyer of peace today abortion which brings people to such blindness and for this i appeal in india and i appeal everywhere the child is gods gift to the family each child is created in the special image and likeness of god for greater things to love and to be loved in this year of the family we must bring the child back to the center of our care and concern this is the only way that our world can survive because our children are the only hope for the future as older people are called to god only their children can take their places even if a mother could forget her child i will not forget you i have carved you in the palm of my hand
5181068 please dont destroy the child we will take the child
5181069 come we will take care of you we will get a home for your child
5181070 anyone who receives a child in my name receives me
5181071 you people who have practiced chastity you are the best people to teach us natural family planning because it is nothing more than self control out of love for each other

5181083 entre los justicialistas creo que sabemos que nos va a ser muy dif cil ganar la elecci n del 2011 por eso es mi preocupaci n para que haya una alternativa con posibilidades de gobernar y eso significa tener estructuras partidarias

5181098 when christ went to bed at night he was in real solidarity with the many persons who not by choice but by circumstance sleep alone anyone who because of unwanted circumstances is effectively blocked from enjoying sexual consummation is a victim of a most painful poverty to sleep alone is to be poor to sleep alone is to be stigmatized outside the norm for human intimacy and to feel acutely the sting of that when jesus went to bed alone he was in solidarity with that pain in solidarity with the poor
5181099 what we do with the fires inside of us about how we channel our eros
5181100 we can forgive each others sins not we but the power of christ within us
5181101 you can continue to love and forgive them and insofar as they receive that love and forgiveness from you they are receiving love and forgiveness from god
5181102 if you are a member of the body of christ when you forgive someone he or she is forgiven if you hold someone in love he or she is held to the body of christ
5181103 hell is possible only when one has put oneself totally out of the range of love actively rejected not so much explicit religious or moral teaching and practice as the sincere love of humanity
5181104 if a child or brother or a sister or a loved one of yours strays from the church in terms of faith practice and morality as long as you continue to love that person and hold him or her in union and forgiveness he or she is touching the hem of the garment is held to the body of christ and is forgiven irrespective of his or her official external relationship to be church and christian morality
5181105 your touch is christs touch if someone close to you dies in a state which externally at least has her or him at odds ecclesially and morally with the visible church your love and forgiveness will continue to bind that person to the body of christ and continue to forgive that individual even after death
5181106 we do not at the most basic of all levels need explicit confession to a priest to have our sins forgiven
5181107 thus any one of us who visits a sick or dying person regardless of how inadequate and stuttering our words might be anoints that person just as a priest does in the sacrament of the sick it anoints them for their impending death the incarnation has given us incredible power
5181108 on a street circuit it is of major importance to have a good basic set up which is easy to drive
5181109 the lap time improvement has to be gained step by step you cannot drive in too wild a style also in terms of the racing line you have to approach this gradually
5181110 it is very important to walk the track before driving it the first time to get a feeling for the surface and the layout
5181111 i am very much looking forward to valencia as i am a big fan of street circuits in general
5181112 they are very demanding as they are often bumpy and the street surface changes when you make a mistake you easily run into barriers

5181119 i would like to thank all the drivers and fans for their kind concerns and support and i will be back to the track soon

5181132 the old media is facing challenge from new media like internet anybody can spread his opinions throughout the world using internet women are no exception in this regard
5181133 if the traditional media fail to face the challenge of the new media and give space to women they will lag behind
5181134 blogging is a new trend and women are involved with it there is a website named blogher solely for women and it has 13000 members all over the world
5181135 media is one of the most powerful tools that we have to shape the world we live in
5181136 through the media and the information it provides we are able to influence what people know and what they dont know and their attitudes about almost everything and everyone
5181137 from september 11 or even earlier from the time of the iranian revolution we are seen as a violent people stern and dour and who impose oppressive rules on society especially on women
5181138 this stereotype disregards the diversity of the muslim world and the many good aspects of our societies
5181139 coverage of the more sensational violent and salacious stories about the west causes our people to view the west as an immoral and dangerous place and ignores admirable traits such as volunteerism and community spirit
5181140 we are often as guilty of imbalance as the west is
5181141 in all parts of the world women are not a significant part of the media workforce in asia they make up 21 percent of the workforce in latin america 25 percent in southern africa 27 percent and in western europe and the united states 35 percent

5181180 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5181181 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5181182 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5181201 a number of individuals were detained and questioned this week as a result of a proactive police operation
5181202 consequently some have been charged with drug related offences unconnected to the mullanys murder at this stage we are not in a position to disclose any further information regarding these individuals
5181203 so far as the two females arrested and charged last week they are still remanded in custody at her majestys prison and are linked to the other three persons presently in police custody

5181206 but were making a play for them by saying that obamas economic policies are the true patriotic ones
5181207 look at the game and you realize that youre really planning out a railroad system when you play
5181208 at least thats how i think of it so why not set up something thats closer to simulating the planning process than regular aos where everyone mucks with your track builds
5181209 it was more annoying than fun and productionwise it was ugly so it never really got far in that direction
5181210 the building sections individually thing was really interesting though and eventually i tried out everyone building on copies of exactly the same maps that result was interesting because of random cube draws no two maps ever had the exact same track builds from then on it expanded to the blueprints which look kind of cool too
5181211 interactivity exists in several ways action selection is still determined by turn order which is determined by bidding because money is hidden it adds an extra dimension to standard aos bidding the new production action
5181212 is really neat just last night we were playing and there was a clamor from the players who didnt have the action all hoping and praying and chanting that the cube color called wasnt one that was critical to their success
5181213 outthinking your opponents when it comes to action selection is much more interactive as well because instead of being able to glance around and figure out which actions everyone probably wants that turn you have to figure it out by their previous activities action selection deliveries track builds and income track location
5181214 in practice however that doesnt actually happen and instead the dice rolls have the same sort of impact they do on the regular game
5181215 at the end of the game everyone reveals their maps

5181221 het komt erop neer dat veel beleggingsfondsen de grondstoffen verlaten nu de dollar blijft aansterken

5181235 overblown at all bullying is often very subtle and hugely damaging
5181236 even if theyre going largely unnoticed by the higher ups
5181237 ive heard hundreds of stories by victims bullies and bystanders those who watch and may participate across a wide variety of workplace situations from hospitals to day care centers to schools and corporations
5181238 some situations are handled well others end up in litigation
5181239 i acknowledge that some behavior would fit the description of bullying however in most adult workplaces what people call bullying often turns out to be discourtesy and contentious behavior and sometimes it is not even those things but just behavior the complainer didnt like
5181240 our society is highly aggressive and competitive bullies embody these two popular tactics hostility is more normative than the exception so bullying abuse psychological violence at work is positively embraced more often than despised
5181241 unfortunately employees are usually not in a position to stop bullying generally speaking if bullying continues in the workplace it is because it is tolerated at the highest levels of the organization
5181242 if employers realize the toll that bullying takes on the organization not just specific individuals they should make it absolutely clear that bullying will not be tolerated
5181243 the only solution is for people to feel empowered to speak up to not be fearful of being labeled the rat
5181244 many times employers dont know this exists or theres no track of it so its easy to look the other way co workers might know but often theyre too intimidated to stick their neck out for someone else

5181248 my knowledge and my background told me that a few hundred marines in a situation like that could not successfully carry out any kind of peacekeeping mission and i thought they were going into harms way
5181249 it was really tough especially the run i decided to go out hard and just tried to hang on as long as i could then hang on to someone who was my own pace
5181250 the race was four laps and i was just counting down the ks to the end that last one kilometre i think i felt like i had asthma even though i dont
5181251 the girls put everything out right from start coming off the bike they put their feet down and they really attacked it right from the start it took me a while to get into my pace
5181252 unfortunately it was a bit too long but i found my legs in the end
5181253 im pretty disappointed i had a great swim and felt all right on the bike but then i got tripped in transition and i think i cut my foot

5181303 during first six months of 2008 we operated in both a volatile and unpredictable business environment this quarter we operated with maximum flexibility in order to meet market demands during this period we identified and adapted ourselves to take advantage of the rising global diesel prices during the first six months we refined close to 4 million tons of which 1 149 thousand tons were diesel 17 higher than last year under the strategic plan the erection of the new hydro cracker will increase our utilization rate and the refined produce especially middle distillates turned out of each barrel of oil
5181304 we are gaining speed in the implementation of our strategic plan which will both enable us to better meet the changing market demands as well as enable additional growth opportunities last week the companys general meeting approved the acquisition of the 50 balance of shares in carmel olefins this acquisition will enable us to fully maximize the synergies while enabling oil refineries to mitigate the fluctuations in its various markets we continue to increase the volumes of activity in the trade segment furthermore during 2008 we started to supply both fuel and transportation diesel under the new euro 5 standard this step is expected to draw an increase in demand for more environmentally friendly fuels
5181305 lessons were learned and it was a great motivation for coming to beijing but that has never been a sore point for me
5181306 i knew i had to get out on that run

5181308 its very good news if someone gets killed because some idiot is on their mobile phone they should go to prison it makes my blood boil when i see people driving while on the phone and this might make them think twice id now like to see an automatic 12 month ban for anyone caught driving on their phone that would be a proper deterrent
5181309 i am over the moon everyone has done a lot of work to get this started and its now paid off
5181310 i want to say thank you to all those people who helped to make this happen
5181311 all there was at the front of the terraces was a chain link so when we scored everyone surged forward at least 10 people were pushed through the gap we had just scored one of the most important goals in our history so of course we were celebrating
5181312 we felt we were hard done by when we went to court so it was out of order for the club to ban us
5181313 ive watched the tv footage and personally i have a huge amount of sympathy for them
5181314 but i have to act in the best interests of the club which means not going unilaterally against police advice
5181315 from what we can see and certainly from the new southern fringe developments and places like longstowe and its those larger sites we spend most of our time looking at while conditions are less favourable we are not seeing it translating into a stop of building
5181316 these large developments take a long period of time to build and during that you will clearly go through economic cycles so they have an element of inbuilt correction as they will gain on upturns even if there are slightly more difficult conditions at the moment
5181317 its about recognising there are continuing issues currently and the difficulty first time buyers are having getting mortgages
5181318 when you look at what is happening in cambridge and the surrounds it is somewhat less affected than other areas because there is an underlying demand for houses which shores up a little bit the impact here in this part of the country
5181319 when you go back to the early 1990s when there was a large decline in the housing market cambridge was one of the safer ports in the storm and our potential assumption is that will continue to be the case
5181320 while developers are laying people off its more about liquidity and likely to be a shorter term thing rather than a mass downturn in the same way as before
5181321 the house building sector has been hardest hit by the credit crunch especially by the lack of available finance
5181322 businesses are having to adapt to these changing conditions in order to ensure their future when the economy becomes more buoyant
5181323 i expect there to be more bad news over the next few months but cambridgeshires businesses are more robust than those in many other parts of the country there are positive things happening as well
5181324 its very easy for people to look at things in the gloomiest mirror but the fact is that there is a market for new housing sales and a lot of people have gone into the rental market over the last 12 months to wait and see what happens
5181325 a lot of people are sitting on the fence asking has the market hit the bottom are prices from developers good shall we buy
5181326 the message is clear a developer who feels that they can still achieve the prices at the height of the market is the developer that will not sell but developers taking a pragmatic approach and those that adapt their guide prices regardless of profit expectations are selling
5181327 fra sommeren 2005 til 2007 har p taleenhetene i landets 25 politidistrikter pekt ut 797 menn som aktuelle for hurtig utvisning p grunn av vold mot sin familie eller andre til slutt ble 21 menn utvist hurtig etter familievold under tre prosent av sakene

5181425 we didnt have the team that anybody wouldve picked to win the amount of games that we did

5181432 a timer holds only for 12 hours while a chip can be timed for a longer interval nevertheless we will soon be able to get to the reason why the surat explosives failed to go off
5181433 with the arrest of mufti abu bashir from azamgarh in uttar pradesh today by a joint team of gujarat police and up police it is probably the first time anyone has reached the brain behind such kind of blasts
5181434 used to inspire terror activities in april he had held a big meeting he had also visited ahmedabad by interrogating him more clues about other blasts that occurred in the country earlier could come out we have uncovered sleeper cells successfully
5181435 i wish to say with full pride that for the last 20 days gujarat police has been progressing on its investigation
5181436 if the police cant tell you something as disclosing something prematurely will harm the investigation there is a weird competition among the media to write stories based on speculation
5181437 those arrested were present during a training camp organised by simi in halol in vadodara distrct in january 2008 they were given training on how to survive in adverse conditions and were trained how to tackle police interrogation
5181438 they were also taught how to drive motorcycle and fake an accident during the camp
5181439 it is very unfortunate that media sometimes over excitedly and unknowingly project things in such a way that helps terrorists and gives them boost

5181481 will in any case be reviewed because nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffers statement that russia used disproportionate force to protect its citizens that we acted beyond the limits of self defence is utterly intolerable

5181538 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5181539 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5181540 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5181541 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5181542 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5181543 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5181544 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5181545 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5181546 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5181547 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5181548 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5181549 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5181550 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

5181558 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5181559 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5181560 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5181561 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5181562 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5181563 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5181564 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5181565 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5181566 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5181567 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5181568 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5181569 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5181570 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5181571 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5181572 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5181573 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5181574 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5181575 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5181576 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5181577 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5181578 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5181579 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5181580 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5181581 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5181582 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5181583 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5181584 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5181585 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5181586 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5181587 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5181588 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5181589 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5181590 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5181591 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5181592 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5181593 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5181594 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5181595 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5181596 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5181597 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5181598 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5181599 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5181600 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5181601 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

5181606 to walk with all of the other athletes in the opening ceremonies to be in the athletes village just to go out onto the floor each day and compete its a big step forward and a big move for sports in our country
5181607 it was a very big thing in our country to win the african championship
5181608 there was a great deal of national pride for the accomplishment we even received congratulations from our mens team and from men on the street
5181609 it is not just mali it is so many of the african countries that are dominated by the muslim religion
5181610 there are long held beliefs and attitudes that can be difficult if not impossible to overcome many of those people are never going to change where the progress has to be made is among the moderates
5181611 it wasnt so very long ago that when a woman who was an athlete in mali had a baby that meant that her career in sports was over
5181612 women who played sports in senegal would have children and get back into shape and resume playing now we see that the attitude has slowly changed in my own country and women can continue their careers
5181613 many girls that i grew up with and knew had a difficult time playing sports with all of the muslim rules and regulations
5181614 there are prohibitions against wearing shorts against bearing your arms
5181615 my family was always very moderate with my mother as a former player she always encouraged me to play my father too is a moderate person and a forward thinker both of my parents have encouraged me throughout my athletic career
5181616 this is about getting our experience at the international level and learning about the things we will need to someday be competitive
5181617 the president will address the nation at 1 00 pm 0700 gmt
5181618 the president is determined to defend himself he will fight on he has given no indication that he will accept the charges against him
5181619 there is a strong possibility that he might announce his resignation but there is equally a chance that he might commit a blunder
5181620 our stance is still the same that those who violated the constitution should not be given safe passage or indemnity of his actions
5181621 he is a wise man he is a very experienced
5181622 his political fate has been sealed whatever he says doesnt matter
5181623 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the
5181624 well have a fantastic array of fresh information to use
5181625 i cant thank castrillo hercules enough for putting together such an organized event its one thing to come up with an idea but another to follow through with it and take care of all the logistical problems it presents
5181626 i want to emphasize that we are not compensating surveyees for their answers but for their time
5181627 and typical protocol for any long survery such as this is to offer coffee snacks and token gifts to participants to provide comfort and a stress free atmosphere
5181628 were psyched about this project and want to make it an annual event
5181629 and our plans are already in motion to secure a survey facility data analysis bureau and publishers for next year
5181630 its none of their business what my family income is and how many children i wish to have
5181631 all sports betting information and demographic data gathered in this survey is 100 completely anonymous we ask for no personal identification or names
5181632 i swore i would never take part in big business but the ramifications of this project do benefit higher education and the community at large
5181633 we took a risk being the lead firm in this project
5181634 but preliminary results suggest it was the right thing to do and the fact that we will get the results first puts us miles ahead of the competition
5181635 the russian general vyacheslav borisov promised last night to start the pullout at 10 a m but so far there is no sign
5181636 i appeal to you that after your armed forces leave georgian territory to start serious thinking and discussions about further negotiations a further search for ways to conduct relations in order not to sow discord between our countries for good

5181684 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo

5181693 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5181694 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5181695 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5181696 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5181697 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5181698 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente

5181700 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5181701 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

5181706 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5181707 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

5181711 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5181712 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5181713 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5181714 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5181715 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5181716 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5181717 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5181718 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5181719 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5181720 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5181721 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5181722 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5181723 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5181724 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5181725 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5181726 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5181727 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5181728 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5181729 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5181730 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5181731 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5181732 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5181733 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5181734 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5181735 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5181736 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5181737 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5181738 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5181739 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5181740 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5181741 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5181742 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5181743 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5181744 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5181745 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso

5181836 ondanks de ontkerkelijking zijn er in nederland vanaf 1990 meer dan 281 nieuwe kerken gesticht in meerderheid ging het bij deze kerkplanting om evangelische en pinkstergemeenten
5181837 is een teken van vitaliteit binnen de kerken ik geef toe dat de meeste initiatieven uit evangelische hoek komen waar kerkplanting minder op formele barri res stuit desondanks komt een niet onaanzienlijk deel van de nieuwe gemeenten voort uit traditionele kerken dat vind ik hoopvol

5181841 i can only hope that youd have died on some fly blown beach and wont be coming back
5181842 in your column about former presidential candidate john edwards having a mistress you said that our presidents are guarded like national treasures regardless of the other issues which your column raises there is a necessity for the president and for certain presidential candidates to have an extremely high level of security
5181843 your column about john edwards resonated with me i too thought his comments about his egocentric and narcissistic behavior were wonderfully insightful and candid other politicians could follow his lead to our collective benefit and yes i agree that the adulation we shower on these people is contributory but edwards comments were absolutely refreshing i say that as a woman wronged thanks for your lovely observations
5181844 you are so right on this is not something political this is a human condition story and if it were not about a politician it would not be taking up our time and attention i am waiting for those yelling foul the loudest to be next but can you please tell me how we as a nation can stand in moral judgment after hiroshima or how w can condemn actions he himself took by invading iraq digging saddam hussein out of a hole and hanging him in public
5181845 there are two types of men in politics one is the elliot spitzer type who when discovered goes away as they should the other type is the john edwards antonio villaraigosa john mccain types these guys never go away they somehow weather the storm and stay in there these types are reprehensible but i also condemn mrs edwards who knew her husband was not telling the truth when she knew what he had done she is just as bad as he is
5181846 to clarify my disgust with edwards its not the extramarital sex its the lying when first questioned a man with leadership qualities would have said thank you for your interest but thats a matter between my wife and myself his eagerness to toss his alleged mistress under the bus was alarming in fact he should have said something anything nice about her in his mea culpa he certainly cant be called a man
5181847 maybe the news ought to get back to just reporting the facts let the tabloids speculate and pronounce guilt or innocence i think this is why people are tired of newspapers and news period just give us the facts and let the courts make the decisions
5181848 i think that the breeze should clean up its web site and make it more organized i am tired of looking at the same headline on the same page multiple times the paper should also return to local classified listings if i am searching for a job i want a local one the web site suggests that all of l a is nearby when it isnt at all
5181849 be local be family friendly and be fair and accurate i need a paper that i can give to my kids and let them read it so that you have another customer in 10 years i also have a strong mistrust of the internet because i dont believe the facts are checked as carefully as in a newspaper
5181850 there is a basic reason that most newspapers are losing readership and that is the overwhelming left leaning socialist liberal agenda that you and the monopolistic ap keep putting out there what you all apparently dont get is that most americans love this country we are tired of the blame america first crowd that you the democrats obama the ap and so on are a part of i realize that no matter what most of us unwashed say you elitists know better and you just brush aside our ignorant comments nothing said here will alter your basic beliefs but as long as you and your ilk continue to spew your socialist pap you will continue to lose our support
5181851 i buy a newspaper for the professionalism and credibility i assume journalists bring to their craft i respect fact finding and neutrality in politics i need that to make informed decisions personally i dont like things that dont really matter on the front page at the expense of major news buried inside stay in the center or balance a left with a right point of view on the same page or in the same section when it comes to politics your column is a nice balance to the news i need some humor after some of the hard to take news your column keeps me renewing my subscription
5181852 your article is slanted biased opinionated democratic liberal and highly socialist and has no business being included in a paper how come your editors havent noticed your opinions creeping in you are a big disgrace
5181853 unfortunately its one of those cases where we may never know
5181854 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5181855 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared

5182000 which is always fun to play when you have that kind of artistic license to go big or go home it can be a bit of a romp
5182001 so its hard to be in a bad mood there
5182002 im doing the last three episodes of the season im not entirely sure what the story line is matt executive producer matt nix teased me with a few tidbits which i cant really reveal
5182003 guys of my generation after watching army of darkness or the evil dead movies bruce becomes a type of superhero to you
5182004 thats of course far off from us getting in front of the camera to do it
5182005 it was my first big job and its been going on for a dozen years now and it still goes on
5182006 it looks like a great well respected show runner has come onboard and is working on a seven year plan for it
5182007 i get all of my information from christopher so i have to take everything with a boulder of salt
5182008 its one of those roles where i get to chew every bit of scenery in town
5182009 which is always fun to play when you have that kind of artistic license to go big or go home it can be a bit of a romp
5182010 so its hard to be in a bad mood there
5182011 im doing the last three episodes of the season im not entirely sure what the story line is matt executive producer matt nix teased me with a few tidbits which i cant really reveal
5182012 guys of my generation after watching army of darkness or the evil dead movies bruce becomes a type of superhero to you
5182013 thats of course far off from us getting in front of the camera to do it
5182014 it was my first big job and its been going on for a dozen years now and it still goes on
5182015 it looks like a great well respected show runner has come onboard and is working on a seven year plan for it
5182016 i get all of my information from christopher so i have to take everything with a boulder of salt
5182017 at that moment my mind was totally blank fully relaxed
5182018 before the games i had a lot of sleepless nights because im always concentrating on the matches
5182019 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
5182020 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
5182021 it doesnt take a news flash to figure out that if someone gives you a better chance to improve you should bring them on
5182022 you always aspire to win but the olympics are unique in that another aspect of them is the obligation to improve sports worldwide
5182023 im just the luckiest guy in the world to be able to be a small part of this
5182024 weve got one of the best teams theyve ever assembled here and we just want to do their country proud
5182025 ive eaten about everything that walks crawls swims or flies
5182026 what really raised the bar in our game in the states was when people started to go out and share information
5182027 when i started in the game i think everyone thought they had the secret that changed in the u s and it needs to change internationally
5182028 it makes our job more challenging but i dont see that as a negative
5182029 were ok with it because ultimately it makes our athletes better it forces us to be smarter about how we go about doing what we do
5182030 its a little disappointing but all in all i tried to pull out what i could and im really happy
5182031 our defense was really really good from the first inning on
5182032 i get the thrill and the rush making a play as much as i do getting a base hit
5182033 i had a bad changeup grip when i threw it
5182034 i didnt even see barmes when i threw it but he made a huge heads up play right there
5182035 ive never had to make a play like that playing in and then charging like that it felt really pretty

5182037 perspektivisch gelten die widerst nde bei 115 13 und 115 29 punkten als n chste anlaufmarken
5182038 those young guys have a lot of talent but this is another level
5182039 theyre struggling a little bit but you dont expect freshmen to come in and know the pass blocking and reading the defense you dont do that in high school theres a process for all of us
5182040 its that value of experience hes kind of the whole package
5182041 of course we always like to run a stable of guys in there and well continue to do that
5182042 i thought the young guys would come in and push him
5182043 is trying to figure it out but once he does ray will be dangerous
5182044 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
5182045 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
5182046 michael phelps you just won eight gold medals in the beijing olympics what are you going to do now
5182047 bob said he wants to start fresh do things we havent done new training methods itll be a fun four years
5182048 well have to see how keen he is going to be about sprinting there is training he thinks its easy he can sprint but hes more suited for longer events there is a chance
5182049 probably 80 percent of the team wanted to go home after the trials just for six or seven days
5182050 i only try my best in every practice in every match you dont have a plan for being no 1
5182051 there are a lot more people in spain who play tennis
5182052 i did some photos i did some autographs but always was a pleasure no
5182053 always you can improve no if federer can improve me for sure
5182054 for sure i can improve the slice i can improve the serve 100 percent i have to improve a little bit more the volley too
5182055 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5182056 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5182057 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5182058 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5182059 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5182060 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5182061 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5182074 it is a natural result of what is going on in iraq under this u s occupation that so many iraqi students failed the high school exams
5182075 how can a student pass such difficult exams feeling terrified exhausted in the heat in darkness without electricity having to work in the absence of a dead or detained father and all the problems of the world over his head
5182076 i am ashamed of the results my school achieved this year
5182077 i cannot tell you what percentage we achieved because that will reveal me and my school you do not really believe we are living in a democratic country do you
5182078 if a student is the son of a senior government official or of a member of an armed group how can we stop them from cheating we would be killed
5182079 the low number of students who passed the exams shows credibility and discipline
5182080 i live in an old two room house with my family after we were evicted from shab quarter of amiriya in baghdad
5182081 there are five of us plus our parents in the small place that lacks most living necessities such as electricity not to mention the noisy atmosphere of the crowded space i passed arabic and english because i am good at them but failed the other exams that needed me to study hard
5182082 my father was detained by u s forces in 2005
5182083 his fashion shop was looted by the so called iraqi army who came with the americans to take him away and so now i have to work as a labourer to support my family
5182084 i decided to stop fooling myself by dreaming of going to college and becoming a lawyer
5182085 one has to face reality that iraq is finished as a country
5182086 the americans and their collaborators need us as dirty policemen and garbage collectors who locate roadside bombs for them
5182087 we must realise that college has become a luxury that we cannot afford
5182088 the reason i enlarged the toys to such an enormous size is to highlight the political economic system behind them dinosaur toys are designed by some company from a western country and produced in china then commercially distributed to the whole globe it is the result of transnational capitalist production
5182089 we opened lower because of asian markets and inflation but as the momentum built up people came back to fundamentals

5182092 oil prices also fell to the lower end of the recent trading range on friday so some traders in the market probably saw that as a buying opportunity
5182093 we dont believe theres a need to place additional volume on the market
5182094 its really an amazing example of river geology in our lifetime
5182095 its the biggest and most powerful rapid in dinosaur national monument
5182096 it has calmed down and been re arranged by the river over the years but its still quite a test of peoples abilities
5182097 especially this year it was a good year for the yampa
5182098 and this is about as different as it gets from where i live you dont see anything like this thats for sure its incredible
5182099 i think the allure is that its all so close the canyon walls just jut above you
5182100 you can run it for the fun of the whitewater or the majesty of seeing the canyon it all depends on what youre there for the great thing is that theres something happening on the yampa every day
5182101 you can actually hear it coming from a long ways away
5182102 you can be in a relationship its only when you have anal sex that youre sinning
5182103 you dont want the school to have to deal with this do you
5182104 over his long career in politics bidens biggest financial supporter has been the giant credit card company

5182108 every time george soros attack dogs smear me with lies and distortions on national television my book sales skyrocket
5182109 first although my competitors lead in overall sales my book is selling comparably with them where actual buyers are making their own individual purchasing decisions
5182110 secondly my two principal competitors are indeed members in good standing of the right wing echo chamber or worse they are selling to their own base that has never been in play for barack obama
5182111 my book however is not a right wing screed and is a more fair and balanced where have i heard that before
5182112 obamas defense unfit for publication has the same layout and concept as prior soros publications
5182113 soros has not been able to find any factual errors in obama the man behind the mask so he has launched desperate smears on me based on quarter century old litigation
5182114 my book is a real book that is why soros is pulling out all the stops to suppress the book and suppress me
5182115 in the meantime sales of obama the man behind the mask keep going up my experience proves that when you are under attack by george soros its good for business we are evaluating whether to sue soros and his lackeys for defamation
5182116 america should be warned a vote for obama is a vote to put george soros in power
5182117 in the large corporate end of the market particularly around the financial services sector theres been increased offshoring of it
5182118 its not just cost based the banking and insurance sectors are going through a tough time so organisations are consolidating were seeing that larger market starting to soften
5182119 government and particularly federal government has also made a commitment to reducing public sector numbers and were seeing less expenditure in federal government environments in relation to it
5182120 in one part of our business things are slowing down but the mid market is continuing to move alone nicely
5182121 our growth there has very much been about taking share
5182122 i challenge anyone to prove the reverse they better open the law books of islam
5182123 i think the accusation of sodomy is wrong i have known him for 15 years i believe totally in him
5182124 i hereby declare quasar the official tangency news herald first class of the most exalted of geeks who want to know so let it be written so let it be done
5182125 this is tangency we flogged common sense to pay our pie bill a couple years back
5182126 the associated press document provides additional evidence suggesting the obama campaigns insistence that obama was never trained in islam and he never lived as a muslim is not accurate
5182127 moreover the document indicated that obama may have been an indonesian citizen when he lived there
5182128 this is an issue the obama rebuttal fails to address at all evidently conceding the accuracy of the claim
5182129 the obama rebuttal misses the point in claiming my statements about the school registration are a lie
5182130 it is clearly true that the an american expat in southeast asia blog did state the registration listed obama as an indonesian citizen and a muslim that is not a lie
5182131 i deeply regret the negative tone that too often creeps into american politics
5182132 all the work and sacrifice they made to get me a decent education so i could be standing here in front of you
5182133 my wife and i borrowed to go to college and law school because we dont come from wealthy families when i got out of law school and we got married our combined student loan debt was higher than our mortgage
5182134 and so it took us 10 years to pay that off
5182135 the associated press document provides additional evidence suggesting the obama campaigns insistence that obama was never trained in islam and he never lived as a muslim is not accurate
5182136 some geneology expert claims he is arab american so if thats true its going to bust the myth just like the edwards is the father of the year myth

5182149 i didnt even know i was waiting to see where my place was and when i saw the ar next to my name it just hit me
5182150 i looked around and everyone the u s was out there you guys everyone was going crazy and cheering
5182151 to be here in a usa uniform and to do it with people chanting usa it will be a memory people say the first olympic steeplechase for women will go down in the history books
5182152 we didnt because seconds before the number ten odonovan whos very good at this jumps into people and doesnt actually head it
5182153 he jumped into mick so its a foul before that
5182154 i thought we should have had that decision so we wouldnt be talking about the penalty to be honest with you
5182155 five times that could have happened because im sure that when you jump for the ball youre supposed to jump for the ball and not into the man which happened quite a lot
5182156 i thought mick and gary considering that were excellent they kept their temper well and when you talk about respect for the referee i know were not signing the charter but they did very well
5182157 hes had a chance to finish it but he didnt take it that happens every now and then but its an honest mistake but look at the equalising goal we thought that we could have done more about that and wont worry too much about scotts miss

5182160 verzorgingshuizen moeten altijd reanimeren tenzij iemand aangeeft dat niet te willen en niet andersom

5182162 bij gevallen waarin reanimatie aan de orde ism wordt altijd het dossier geraadpleegd
5182163 bij niet reanimeren loop je het risico dat er toch iemand sterft terwijl diegene wel gereagnimeerd had willen en kunnen worden dat kan bijvoorbeeld gebeuren bij iemand die net in het tehuis is komen wonen en van wie de wens nog niet bekend is het zal geen heel veel voorkomende situatie zijn maar het kan ontegenzeggelijk een keer gebeuren
5182164 maar in het eerste geval is het risico toch het grootste

5182170 here is the bug here is the fix update the driver
5182171 celtic are perfect for him and he will be an excellent signing for them
5182172 glenn was just 17 when i got to know him at feyenoord and i could tell from our first training session he was a no nonsense defender
5182173 when he was coming through the ranks we would often have practise games in training between the first team and younger players of course id be right up against glenn and he wouldnt hold back
5182174 i remember telling him early in his career at feyenoord he would be suited perfectly to british football
5182175 sometimes in holland we expect too much from our stoppers we want them to defend score goals and set up attacks
5182176 so ive no doubt glenn will do well and i hope its another success story for a dutchman at parkhead
5182177 he was playing regularly at the de kuip stadium for feyenoord in front of 50 000 passionate fans
5182178 so playing for celtic is something he will look forward to and be keen to take on
5182179 i tried to put too much on it and ive just not hit it right but im delighted with the one in the second half
5182180 i think after the first one the pressure was on for me to hit the target and i think everyone is delighted that we got the result anyway
5182181 there was a few other tackles the lads got in last ditch but im definitely pleased with the defensive performance and i think the two centre halves did great for us and the boys are buzzing with it
5182182 hes got everything its up to charlie i keep saying to him everyday hes got all the quality in the world a wonderful left foot its a problem position all over the world and if youve got a left foot like hes got then if he can build up because hes got the height but some times hes a bit too easy for his own good its up to him if he wants to grab it
5182183 he has a new agreement with the sport director and with the owner
5182184 the decision has been made to play jamie mcdonald in goal and in the future steve banks will be the new goalkeeper coach he will be on the training staff
5182185 we must make a decision and now the owner is here and we have made a very clear decision and i think a very good decision for everyone
5182186 we have reached agreement with fulham and we still have one or two things to settle with the player and his representatives but we are hopeful that one will go through
5182187 but we have agreed with the club now which is a big thing and we would hope we can reach agreement with stevens people over the next couple of days
5182188 with maurice edu we have to wait on a work permit for that one and hopefully we can be successful there

5182215 a lot of teams have looked at cleveland and looked the other way they see our highlights come on were usually the team other teams have highlights on but not no more were not the team to look over anymore cleveland is in the house
5182216 put us in prime time let us see what we can do
5182217 they are the super bowl champs what else is there to say about them
5182218 we are going to go out there and compete against those guys hopefully we will go out there and continue to do what we have been doing all summer and that is getting better every time we touch the field
5182219 they are the super bowl champs so if you can do decently against these guys then you might say that you have improved and you have a chance
5182220 i consider us the best running back group in the nfl hands down
5182221 they have got some big backs and if their philosophy for this game is to run the ball then we will get a good test to see where we are
5182222 one of the good things about our preseason schedule is that it prepares us for the regular season

5182231 in every way qualified to receive the honour and dignity of knighthood
5182232 it went extremely well and we are delighted that the norwegian guard honoured nils olav with a knighthood
5182233 we all enjoyed the occasion and nils was a perfect penguin throughout
5182234 nils always recognises the norwegian guardsmen when they come to visit him
5182235 he loves the attention he receives at the ceremony and takes his time inspecting the troops
5182236 we are extremely proud of nils olav and pleased that an enduring part of the royal guard is resident in scotland helping to further strengthen ties between our two countries
5182237 we have a long standing history with the norwegian kings guard and it is something we are extremely proud of

5182244 the floods of 2007 show just how serious flooding can be and i am glad to see that this project has been developed to enable people to have a greater understanding of the risk of flooding a number of decisions need to be taken when we look at managing the risk of flooding including our annual spend on flood defences where and how we build new houses and the emergency response procedures we have in place for times of flood this game gives the game player the opportunity to make informed decisions about all of these policy areas
5182245 we are extremely pleased to have been involved in this project this is a new way of making people aware of an issue of huge importance to the uk and we hope that players will not only enjoy the game but it will also encourage them to be more interested and engaged in the tough political decisions needed to deal with flood risk through the website we want people to respond to consultations write to their local mp find out their flood risk and make their voice heard
5182246 we are delighted to have worked with playgen on this project keeping this issue in the public eye is vital around 45 000 norwich union customers were affected by the floods in 2007 our job is twofold to put things right for our customers as quickly as possible and secondly work in partnership with the government agencies and the general public to ensure the uk is better prepared for the effects of flooding in future
5182247 a network for london needs to be robust flexible enough to meet todays business needs guarantee bandwidth and provide room for growth
5182248 our slas assure clients of the highest possible level of support and to back it all up we provide round the clock customer service to date geo has never had a fibre cut in london and has the lowest network fault rate of any uk operator we understand that businesses value the peace of mind that comes from knowing that their communications networks are able to cope with future demand
5182249 with over 280 million of assets under our control proper management and recording of them is vitally important these figures form a core part of our end of year reporting and accounts and now they are also central to compliance with sorp 2007
5182250 sorp is the local authority mandatory and statutory framework for compiling our annual statement of accounts
5182251 traditionally these have been put together differently from those of private organisations local authority accounting is developing all the time as convergence with uk gaap generally accepted accounting principals and in the near future ifrs international financial reporting standards will require changes to our methods of accounting and system requirements
5182252 the annual sorp provides us with the statutory framework which ensures compliance with legislation and accounting standards
5182253 with over 9 000 fixed assets each with their own historic cost record we have a great deal of information which needs to be collected and collated in order to review it against their current value its essential that we ensure the historic and current cost accounts are available and that each asset has a revaluation reserve
5182254 bassetlaw invested in asset4000 to record and manage our individual fixed assets land property equipment or anything with a value over 10 000 in respect of our assets we set up asset4000 to detail everything so if an asset is enhanced its all in the register this makes it extremely simple for us to generate the necessary records in order to comply with sorp 2007
5182255 without rams software collating all this information would have been a horrendously labour intensive task we changed our internal procedures to comply with the sorp regulations and then used the ram software to deliver it
5182256 we have a software tool that is precise and easy to use whilst giving us a totally accurate picture of our assets subject to audit
5182257 at the end of the financial year all we do is run a single report and transfer the information straight into our annual accounts asset4000 always saves us a lot of time and effort and this year we couldnt have met the sorp 2007 requirements effortlessly without it

5182298 we were aware from january and february that there was a downturn and it continued to worsen into late spring and early summer
5182299 we had an account with a housebuilder who could not pay so we were faced with a large cashflow problem we had discussions with our bank but they did not consider it a good market in which to attempt to save the business
5182300 we entered receivership and made all our employees redundant on july 31
5182301 we were busy but we werent winning any pitches for new business some companies just decided to put their plans on hold
5182302 this was the weakest set of labour market data since the economic slowdown began
5182303 employment growth has ebbed to a trickle indeed employment has fallen in several regions of the country while the rise in unemployment is gaining worrying momentum the number of unemployed people claiming the jobseekers allowance has risen in every month since january with each monthly increase greater than the last and there are now more people in receipt of this welfare benefit than a year ago
5182304 the impact of the economic slowdown is also becoming more widespread
5182305 moreover for the first time since the credit crunch emerged there is a clear sign that redundancies are on the rise
5182306 the labour market is only just starting to be hit from factors that began six or nine months ago there is going to be a much bigger rise in unemployment ahead
5182307 we have already seen a sharp drop off in hiring intentions
5182308 if you look at previous recessions the housebuilding industry always goes first
5182309 unless there is an upturn by the end of september more redundancies will follow
5182310 the private housebuilding market is basically nonexistent what is so surprising is the speed with which it has happened
5182311 at the end of the summer we are certainly looking for direction from clients on their plans for the rest of this year and going into 2009 thats when they will sign off on head counts
5182312 more people are staying put and employers are interviewing one more time before they make an offer but the further away you get from banking the more cushioned it is there is definitely a slowdown but it is not an absolute bloodbath
5182313 the thing that would really concern me is that there seems to be an increasing mood of pessimism which could have a serious confidence effect on employers
5182314 the worry would be if managers came back from their summer holidays and decided that they had to cut back aggressively thats when you could get an avalanche effect

5182317 respondents to the survey indicated that the highest value of fraud had been perpetrated by gps at 29
5182318 pharmacies too demonstrate a similar trend in that they represent 18 of claims paid out but 28 of the fraud investigated
5182319 what has been interesting to note in this survey is that the hospitals have by far the biggest percentage of claims at 38 yet the value of fraud investigated was only three percent which seems to suggest a level of legitimacy in hospital claims
5182320 the local authorities in puntland banned interviewing and broadcasting the speeches of the candidates but we ignored the ban and interviewed one of the presidential candidates last night

5182368 india has emerged as the second largest producer and exporter of cotton in the world largely due to planting of bt cotton a major success story in indias agricultural biotechnology development
5182369 due to the recession in the us the importers there are asking for discounts in such a scenario the domestic industry cannot pass the increased cost of raw materials to its customers
5182370 the cost of raw materials has increased substantially around one third of our raw cotton is exported and the domestic mills are left in the lurch the cost of power has also gone up and the companies are forced to use their own generators as most states are not able to supply adequate electricity
5182371 the decision to withdraw the import duty on cotton came in july and the textile mills capacities during the first quarter of 2008 were underutilised on account of non availability of raw cotton at competitive prices

5182385 it gives mccain a bounce most social conservatives want to know that he has a faith in god but what they are looking for is where that leads him to stand on the issues
5182386 its important to keep in mind that while mccain has had some differences with evangelical leaders in the past he has reached out to them
5182387 he is strongly pro life and so on this signature social issue he is very consistent with evangelical perspectives
5182388 the campaign is starting to look more like 2004 than we expected it to look like the map still favors obama but mccain has made some gains the last six weeks

5182390 its a really tough group of competitors most of them with multi olympics and or olympic medals under their belts getting to this point was a really big jump for us because weve never raced internationally
5182391 each race in the regatta weve been taking day by day entering the regatta we had no idea where wed end up being in the final and racing with this class of guys was pretty special relatively speaking were young we did our best out there but these guys are very skilled its a tough group weve got growth and maybe one day well be a little bit further up
5182392 the dust hasnt quite settled but in all the scenarios when we set out on this journey this is certainly one of the better outcomes we could have hoped for
5182393 were grateful to be here were very glad that in a lot of ways our hard work paid off there are a lot of great athletes who just miss this
5182394 you have to have perspective we accomplished a lot a lot of crews that we raced were very surprised to see us up here i think we might have ruined a few peoples regattas along the way thats the game and were very proud
5182395 i came out today and i just wanted to do my best race ever i thought this is your pr personal record i knew i was with everybody at 1 000 i thought it would be hard to hold that pace and i just held on
5182396 i felt i was closing in so i picked it up a little at the end i was like just keep it together dont let up it was better than my best race im so excited i cant see straight right now but im so thrilled i cant believe it
5182397 if we came here and finished 14th its our first regatta
5182398 it happens there are guys who are returning silver medalists who didnt make the finals were pretty satisfied

5182418 keeping in view the hardships of the people we have decided to give relaxation in the strike on tuesday wednesday and thursday
5182419 juma shouldnt be offered in any of the masjids in srinagar
5182420 indian agencies can throw a grenade or do something mischievous to sabotage the movement
5182421 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5182422 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5182423 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5182424 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5182425 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5182426 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5182427 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5182428 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5182429 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5182430 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5182431 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5182432 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5182433 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5182434 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5182435 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5182436 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5182437 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5182438 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5182439 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5182440 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5182441 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5182442 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5182443 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5182444 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5182445 communication et de la formation sur ce qui touche aux nouvelles technologies chez panasonic
5182446 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5182447 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5182448 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5182449 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5182450 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5182451 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5182452 this is a planning took where all things are going
5182453 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5182454 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5182455 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5182456 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5182457 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5182458 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5182459 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5182460 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5182461 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5182462 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5182463 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5182464 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5182465 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5182466 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5182467 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5182468 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5182469 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5182470 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5182471 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5182472 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5182473 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5182474 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5182475 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5182476 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5182477 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5182478 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5182479 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5182480 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5182481 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5182482 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5182483 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5182484 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5182485 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5182486 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5182487 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5182488 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5182489 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5182490 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5182491 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5182492 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5182493 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5182494 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5182495 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5182496 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5182497 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5182498 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5182499 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5182500 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5182501 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5182502 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5182503 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5182504 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5182505 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5182506 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5182507 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5182508 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5182509 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5182510 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5182511 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5182512 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5182513 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5182514 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5182515 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5182516 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5182517 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5182518 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5182519 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5182520 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5182521 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5182522 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5182523 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5182524 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5182525 we are on a day long strike to protest against the merger
5182526 date as may be notified by the government of india in the official gazette
5182527 corporate investment growth in 2007 08 and prospects for 2008 09
5182528 with prospects of declerating pace in growth of domestic and global economy environment for the fixed investments due to its cyclical nature could become less conducive

5182532 cosmetics and fragrance companies are being lured by the tax free and 100 per cent ownership incentives being offered by the dubai airport free zone a new trend we are seeing is that quite a number of these companies are coming and setting up middle east regional offices in dubais airport free zone
5182533 research indicates that residents of the uae and gcc countries are increasingly appearance conscious with over 30 000 salons in gcc spurring demands for beauty products
5182534 in fact the consumption of cosmetics and perfumes in the region is ranked among the highest per capita worldwide with an average purchase per head of around aed 1 226

5182543 everything is set for the champions trophy to be held in pakistan and the icc fully supports our security plans and planning it is only a few players who are grumbling and their concerns are emotional pressure not based on reasoning or logic
5182544 i would advise these players to not be stubborn and behave sensibly
5182545 the icc and its member boards are satisfied with our security arrangements and foolproof planning and there is no reason for not having the champions trophy in pakistan

5182555 it isnt mr faheys job to decide who is in the olympic program
5182556 up to now we have always had support from the ioc and in particular from the president jacques rogge
5182557 why should the uci or the sport of cycling be thrown out of the olympic games we saw wonderful road races in a wonderful setting we are watching magnificent track racing cycling brings a huge amount to the olympic games
5182558 if mr fahey wants to make statements such as that he should look a little bit further to some other sports and comment on them as well because their statistics arent different than the ucis statistics
5182559 on a personal level i would say that but on a professional level we have to work within the wada anti doping code and within normal civil laws
5182560 until such time as the wada anti doping code allows us to do that i dont think we will
5182561 i think its a very very strong message to the rest of the peloton that you dont listen to the quasi doctors who tell you this product is undetectable
5182562 it is such a black period i dont even know what to think
5182563 it is not that devyatovskiy performed badly everyone has bad days
5182564 i said that he did not put his all into the performance there is a big difference at the moment we are not speaking
5182565 a member of the russian team no matter that he has only one leg must finish
5182566 the thing that im most concerned about as a scientist
5182567 were going to get a meter and theres nothing we can do about it
5182568 its going to happen no matter what the question is when
5182569 has consequences about where people live and what they care about
5182570 were going to be into this big national debate about what we protect and at what cost
5182571 sea level rise is going to have more general impact to the population and the infrastructure than almost anything else that i can think of
5182572 weve had a third of a meter in the last century
5182573 its like sticking your finger in a pot of water on a burner and you turn the heat on williams said

5182579 we intend to do a friendly takeover while we keep our options open
5182580 there will be a few tears at the end of the day but there will be lots of stories great music a beer or two and maybe the odd cuban cigar
5182581 he brought great pleasure to the people of ireland and yet more around the world ronnie will be greatly missed by many but most particularly by his family with whom our thoughts are today
5182582 ronnie whether as part of the dubliners or during his solo career will also be remembered for his promotion of irish music both at home and around the world he bore his illness with bravery and will be sadly missed
5182583 his contribution to irish music and irish life was immeasurable and his influence will be felt for many many years to come
5182584 we have now lost three members of the original dubliners ronnie drew
5182585 what you are seeing is team gb raising their game on the highest stage and that must inspire the country to back the teams as we move forward we must build on it we must build on it immediately
5182586 this is an excellent springboard to 2012 but the bar is being raised ever higher by our performances and public expectation
5182587 the big challenge is to be ruthless in funding success and not funding failure sport at that level is ruthless
5182588 we hope it will be a habit to start using the rails at these times
5182589 what do you mean well need to rethink our content
5182590 just imagine the dropdown menu includes all the colour choices
5182591 on the private credit side of the equation we expect originations will fall 4 but again all of this decrease will occur in our non traditional channels
5182592 private credit portfolios which we would expect to originate about 7 billion in total this year
5182593 of course private loans remain a financing challenge but at least on private loans we can adjust our pricing to absorb most of our incremental funding costs
5182594 as i said before it private credit is funding challenged but the loan yields can cover most of the increased costs
5182595 dit waren eigenlijk twee relatief makkelijke bezoekjes geen grote problemen gelukkig soms is dat anders en dan ben ik echt aan het trainen met hond en cli nt ik probeer altijd om goed te luisteren naar mijn cli nten en om in een ongedwongen sfeer te werken daar zijn we immers allemaal het meeste bij gebaat
5182596 because when i go to the court and the other players know i beat 19 players in a row and nobody can beat me it is good for me
5182597 but the important points i played very good that was the difference
5182598 im pretty sad that maybe i couldnt give 100 percent today
5182599 its pretty sore too tight and i feel it when i move or serve or get ready for a return
5182600 no one likes to be perceived or seen as being arrogant and i dont like that i dont like it and i admit its a problem for me
5182601 if i get asked a question i normally give a straight answer and some people perceive that as arrogance
5182602 thats the way i approach things i try to answer everything truthfully i try to answer everything as directly as i possibly can i call things as i see them
5182603 some people see that as arrogance i admit that and it is a problem for us and it is something i have to work on
5182604 clearly there has been recent debate about the jury system here in queensland arising out of a couple of cases
5182605 while these amendments have not been designed with any particular case in mind they will apply to any case where an application is heard from the time that the amendments become law
5182606 stop the deafening silence and openly condemn the ongoing intimidation and harassment of media and civil society workers in
5182607 we are about much more than just keeping in touch we are about making people more productive in their business network
5182608 i turned down a road i dont normally go down and i slowed down and sort of pulled in behind a line of parked cars
5182609 as this van drove by this hand came out and just bashed me in the back with the aim of pushing me in front of the car luckily i managed to put the brakes on
5182610 she went to a day school was a goth at 14 had a quite wild childhood and is unconventional and challenging and that is very good as it stopped me from being too straight down the line
5182611 she once said only half joking that she was so bored being married to an mp in a party thats going nowhere if you think you can sort it out then you had better get on and do it
5182612 i tend to cry when im happy and i did then and then samantha started crying
5182613 it hits you like a freight train because all the expectations you have for your child change immediately
5182614 i love him dearly but weve definitely managed to get to a situation where he has not taken over our lives
5182615 pretty classic church of england racked with doubt and scepticism believer
5182616 i have answered this question in the way that i chose to which is to say that i believe all politicians have the right to a private past
5182617 in many ways thats more difficult and complicated to do but its no less an ambition its no less a task and at its heart its dealing with the issues of family breakdown welfare dependency failing schools crime and the problems that we see in too many of our communities
5182618 he was not tough enough with his team they kept saying i am sorry im not going to accept this i dont want to go well im sorry when i want someone to go i simply tell them and then thats that
5182619 it was a big roll of the dice to do it without any notes no autocue no funny business there was a moment when i lost my train of thought but no one really noticed

5182629 mr sarkozy warned mr medvedev that in case russia fails to comply with the provisions of the agreement itll have a negative impact on the further relations of russia and the
5182630 if the two parties stick to the agreement reached this war will become one of the briefest
5182631 on monday will manage to adopt a resolution which will bring about sending international peace keeping forces in the zone of the conflict
5182632 those are just russias troops and they must get out of the territory of georgia
5182633 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia regard this party as a peace keeping body russia surely takes account of these positions and fully supports them
5182634 abkhazia and south ossetia are parts of georgia and the world community has reiterated that itll be so in the future there is no doubt regarding this matter
5182635 russia doesnt stick to the ceasefire agreement i cant give the reason why i thought that if the russian president says that the troops will pull out the troops will pull out but they havent done it the president gave his word and i hope he will keep it
5182636 nampaknya daripada pemerhatian kami keadaan agak panas sama seperti di beberapa pilihan raya kecil seperti di ijok sanggang lunas dan pendang
5182637 jangan ada mana mana pihak yang bertindak menjadi polis biarkan pihak polis yang buat kerja
5182638 saya ini bukanlah antipolis jadi kita buatlah apa yang mereka suruh asal jangan bertentangan dengan apa yang kita mahu kita bukan mahu keganasan kita mahu satu perubahan
5182639 saya rasa pemimpin pemimpin parti dan penyokong perlu menghormati tugas dan tanggungjawab polis
5182640 saya rasa membimbangkan apabila mendengar ada perkembangan tidak sihat tapi spr akan terus menjalankan tugas untuk memastikan kelancaran proses pilihan raya
5182641 kalau orang ramai bimbang akan berlaku keganasan dan ada orang tidak peraturan ini akan menyebabkan minat orang ramai untuk mengambil bahagian dalam pilihan raya akan terjejas
5182642 kami menolak keganasan kesal dengan apa yang berlaku mahu siasatan faktanya kekal dalam sejarah pilihan raya kecil di malaysia yang pernah mati bukannya penyokong bn yang pernah maut adalah penyokong pembangkang
5182643 saya merujuk kepada pilihan raya kecil padang terap 1986 dalam tragedi lubuk merbau semasa lawatan petang datuk seri najib tun razak ketika itu ketua pemuda di felda lubuk merbau

5182646 siamo di fronte ad un vero e proprio accanimento personale nei confronti di chi si occupa di sicurezza de angelis infatti nel 2006 aveva subito un analogo provvedimento poi ritirato dalle fs sempre per la sua attivit sindacale durante la vertenza dei macchinisti contro il pedale delluomo morto
5182647 altro gesto gravissimo e un attacco frontale alla sicurezza e ai delegati che svolgono con incisivit il loro ruolo finalizzato a cucire la bocca a tutti su una questione di interesse generale quale la sicurezza dei viaggiatori
5182648 a fronte del silenzio mantenuto per giorni dalle fs su quellepisodio le preoccupazioni espresse da de angelis prosegue sono da considerare innanzitutto come ladempimento di un dovere nei confronti dei lavoratori e degli utenti del treno questo licenziamento rappresenta inoltre anche una sfida al sindacato che segue di pochi giorni lingiusto licenziamento degli otto operai delle officine di genova
5182649 non e stato motivato per aver diffuso notizie sullepisodio verificatosi il 14 luglio 2008 peraltro ampiamente noto

5182738 it isnt mr faheys job to decide who is in the olympic program
5182739 up to now we have always had support from the ioc and in particular from the president jacques rogge
5182740 why should the uci or the sport of cycling be thrown out of the olympic games we saw wonderful road races in a wonderful setting we are watching magnificent track racing cycling brings a huge amount to the olympic games
5182741 if mr fahey wants to make statements such as that he should look a little bit further to some other sports and comment on them as well because their statistics arent different than the ucis statistics
5182742 on a personal level i would say that but on a professional level we have to work within the wada anti doping code and within normal civil laws

5182744 mcquaid added that he was pleased to see that drug testers recently caught cyclists using a new substance

5182752 we need to be debriefed about this whole issue by the football bosses it does not augur very well for our relationship with the nfa and to put it bluntly we are very disappointed how everything was handled
5182753 the nfa has to give us proposals and a detailed plan of action in regard to funding these teams and we will then look into the budget
5182754 we have to invest on local resources this symposium it seems to me was an exercice all lecturers were nationals personnel of the ministry but what matters most is that they are staff of the sports sector staff of areas linked to sports

5182774 we expected the olympics would not be a powerful marketing tool but the opposite has been the case the market hasnt matured to the stage of the us or uk in terms of marketing literacy and the celebrity aspect is still very strong if you can tie liu xiang or yao ming to your product that has a big impact
5182775 other countries are interested in the olympics but in china well over 90 of people are passionate and supportive and want to be involved
5182776 for us its about connecting with athletes we make products that make them perform better and then build on the excitement that creates
5182777 theyre a lot cheaper but the style and technology of adidas and nike are better i usually buy nike for running but a lot of the adidas casualwear looks really good
5182778 china has 400 million under 20s who are watching the olympics and falling in love with sports most people in china still are not playing sport when it does catch up wow

5182796 if you step back and look at it a logical move for a company whose technology is going into decline would be to merge with or be sold to another company

5182798 its better not to use computers than to use proprietary software

5182800 im all for the free and open source movements because they create competition but saying that commercial software subjugates the user is way over the top
5182801 the important freedom i enjoy is being free to embrace all forms of creative endeavor to eschew one over the other because it is proprietary verges on the irrational to insist that only your point of view is correct is a form of arrogance to claim that its better not to use computers than to use proprietary software is foolishness i detest fanaticism in any form

5182824 friends who visit las vegas prefer the page of the landscape to the text of the neon they seem to think its more authentic i on the other hand suspect that authenticity is all together elsewhere that they are responding to natures ability to mimic the sincerity of a painting that the question of the sunset and the strip is more a matter of ones taste in duplicity one either prefers the honest fakery of the neon or the fake honesty of the sunset the undisguised artifice of culture or the cultural construction of authenticity the genuine rhinestone finally or the imitation pearl

5182861 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5182862 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time the casualties were treated at a nearby isaf medical facility where two of them children remain seriously ill
5182863 isaf deeply regrets the tragedy of this incident when women and children were killed and injured as a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they would have known women and children were present have yet again shown a complete disregard for the lives of the innocent who they claim to fight for

5182880 will in any case be reviewed because nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffers statement that russia used disproportionate force to protect its citizens that we acted beyond the limits of self defence is utterly intolerable
5182881 these are not credible allegations especially coming from the head of an organisation like nato which has itself used not just disproportionate force but force against civilian targets and the civilian population especially in its conflict with yugoslavia in 1999 mr rogozin added

5183003 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5183004 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5183005 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5183006 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5183007 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5183008 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5183009 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5183010 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5183011 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5183012 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5183013 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5183014 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5183015 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5183016 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5183017 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5183018 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5183019 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5183020 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5183021 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5183022 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5183023 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5183024 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5183025 no scared of it i aint never heard of it
5183026 no scared of it i aint never heard of it
5183027 well the breakfast for children program is a socialistic program its a communistic program
5183028 well i tell you what boy ive been knowing you since you were knee high to a grasshopper n r and i dont know if i like communism and i dont know if i like socialism but i know that that breakfast for children program feeds my kids n r and if you put your hands on that breakfast for children program im gonna come off this can and im gonna beat your ass like a
5183029 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5183030 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5183031 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5183032 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5183033 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5183034 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5183035 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5183036 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5183037 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5183038 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5183039 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5183040 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5183041 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5183042 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5183043 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5183044 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5183045 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5183046 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5183047 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5183048 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5183049 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5183050 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5183051 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5183052 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5183053 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5183054 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5183055 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5183056 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5183057 who are open to doing something on the production side
5183058 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5183059 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5183060 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5183061 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5183062 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5183063 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5183064 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5183065 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5183066 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5183067 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5183068 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5183069 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5183070 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5183071 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5183072 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5183073 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5183074 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5183075 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5183076 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5183077 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5183078 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5183079 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5183080 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5183081 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5183082 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5183083 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5183084 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5183085 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5183086 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5183087 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5183088 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5183089 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5183090 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5183091 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5183092 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5183093 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5183094 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5183095 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5183096 arent you supposed to finish one project before you start another
5183097 international relations and international communications in boston university but only that
5183098 our nation has made this commitment anyone who targets a child for harm will be a primary target of law enforcement thats our commitment were waging an aggressive nationwide effort to prevent the use of the internet to sexually exploit and endanger children
5183099 internet child pornography how is the fbi combating this crime
5183100 the balanced scorecard retains traditional financial measures but financial measures tell the story of past events an adequate story for industrial age companies for which investments in long term capabilities and customer relationships were not critical for success these financial measures are inadequate however for guiding and evaluating the journey that information age companies must make to create future value through investment in customers suppliers employees processes technology and innovation
5183101 while this session was one of the first of the conference i personally found it to be the best it had the best delivery format attention to being recorded and moderator
5183102 customer service is a fragile commodity that short term attention or programs will not solve
5183103 customer advocacy the perception on the part of consumers that the firm does whats best for its customers not just the firms own bottom line
5183104 the firms that score best on customer advocacy also receive high marks from customers on 1 simplicity 2 transparency 3 benevolence and 4 trustworthiness firms that demonstrate these four components of customer advocacy enjoy the most important fruits of loyalty customers willing to consider the firm for future purchases
5183105 be careful in using this theory as a guide for admissions and student services planning as one chancellor of a major public university system urged his campus leaders to do

5183107 im not sure it would speak to anyone else except maybe the people in a one block radius but to me its the sound of my neighborhood
5183108 we have an interest in sound and we have an interest in eavesdropping on people
5183109 and your point is what about this makes it wrong to own a church building to house the church when were having church
5183110 entails it doesnt include sharing life together as in my childhood church or sharing during the meeting as in my custer church it means come in sing sit down and listen give an offering follow the announcements and go out to dinner but not typically with other church members
5183111 which is definitely worth a look the blog banner she has created for this carolyn makes some wonderful blog banners you can check one of mine
5183112 were living under a regime which talks about the necessity for exporting our values forcing them on other people whether they like it or not as if they were children who needed to be given bitter medicine for their own good but what this medicine is of course is largely a culture of images as such when it appears invasively within a culture that fears or at least distrusts the image then great cognitive dissonances clanging disharmonies and cultural abysses open up
5183113 tend to feel that some kind of basic human right is being threatened when the image is critiqued
5183114 now the old king is dead long live the king

5183116 we made a bit of a mistake at the beginning
5183117 probably every other boat that had a chance of a medal wanted to attack us but we had a good run then got where we needed to be and did a great job holding down on the run
5183118 the difference here to athens is that at one point nick and i thought wed lost it
5183119 but for the last three races to be so good were really pleased to have turned it around
5183120 for me theres no nervousness quite the opposite bolt seems like the jesse owens of his generation hes natural there has been progression we were in kingston a few years ago to see him win the world junior 200m title at 15 hes a nice guy too
5183121 i say to them to come down come down and see our programme come down and see our testing and see how we operate
5183122 the jamaicans are being tested a lot theres no question of that weve target groups and we look at the top people its not about doubt its more about insurance
5183123 we test the top athletes and we test them a lot if these are the people producing the best performances theyre the ones tested
5183124 who knows how fast he can go obviously from the race he can go faster than the 9 69sec
5183125 he was having fun in the last 20 metres and breaking the world record in the process he can probably go under 9 60 but im not very good at making predictions
5183126 i havent got a girlfriend and i cant do the kind of things all my friends are doing as college students
5183127 i swim listen to hip hop and work on my car but in my opinion thats still a pretty good life i dont know whether id want to trade it for anything
5183128 if anyone in my back up team thinks they should be in front of him i dont want them
5183129 we are all here to back him up we are all behind him
5183130 but the biggest thing i have learnt is that there is so much more to learn what happened on saturday was the best possible ending to the last project but now we have to start again
5183131 i came into this olympiad saying i would do the trials and see what comes and this is what will happen again we dont know who will be around i would be happy to try another boat another challenge i just want to get involved
5183132 you cant see where you are going and you are racing people you cannot see but you have to try the experience the feel and the flow and the beauty of the sport being in a boat at full flight beating down the track and seeing crews slip behind you is a feeling nothing else can give
5183133 the idea is to get the club closer to gb rowing and to step up to the plate in attracting young athletes and developing them gb needs a bigger base and one thing i can do in this next year is to give my time to inspire young people to come through
5183134 and it gives me a chance to go to groups of young guys and not tell them how to do it but to give them targets and let them find their own route what happened on saturday was my target now we have to focus on 2012 it will be big for me and massive for rowing and for molesey

5183139 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5183140 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5183141 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5183142 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5183143 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5183144 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5183145 according to islam an individual seeking justice should be respected even though it may be a personal issue
5183146 there are those who question his method and whether he is following the right procedure but in his heart he must have a clear intention
5183147 the incident must have been traumatic otherwise he would not have lodged the police report

5183156 it kind of goes with the game of baseball as a pitcher all i can do is try to throw the pitches in the catchers glove and try to execute all my pitches with my locations and try to keep the team in the game so far this season my win loss record hasnt shown how ive actually pitched i think ive pitched much better than my 3 10 win loss record but once im in the game the hitters have their job to do and i have my job to do and all i can do is keep the team in the game and give them a chance to win
5183157 it can be frustrating but at the same time its not as if the hitters arent trying everyone is giving it their best out there on the field some days it works out and some days it doesnt if it just so happens on my day every fifth day thats just the way it goes as long as the team does well and i give them a chance to win and get us to the postseason and help us win another championship thats all i cam ask for
5183158 oh man well as of right now im not really sure but id have to say cutch when he was here cutch is kind of a goofball hed be my pick
5183159 i want to be a yankee but its not the only team weve got a lot of teams jeter and cano are good players and i have to work more to get better and try to get their spot but if i cant weve got more teams the yankees arent the only team

5183206 by 7 august all seemed well in the host city with average room rates across the market hitting an average of rmb 3 700 and occupancy levels at 76
5183207 these performance levels have largely held since and room rate performance is higher than we expected to see
5183208 occupancy performance on the other hand below 80 is a little lower than what may have been hoped for in the lead up to the games
5183209 it is really a tale of two cities with some hotels recording clearly outstanding performance levels while other hotels seem to be missing out hotels located in the cbd downtown and yansha areas are typically performing strongly

5183240 we met the general of the russian peacekeepers and he said that the separatists were not answering the phone
5183241 where were the russian peacekeepers when the south ossetians were shelling the georgian positions
5183242 at 6 i gave the order to prepare everything to go out from the bases
5183243 on thursday thursday afternoon they noticed equipment and troops on the road rolling to karaleti
5183244 we are ready for any sort of agreement in the interest of peace
5183245 from 18 00 georgian troops from inner districts are relocated to the area
5183246 bryza said he was not told that georgian armor was already moving toward the south ossetian line and continued to do so even after saakashvili declared a cease fire
5183247 they felt they had to defend the honor of their nation and defend their villages it was a very dangerous dynamic that was part of an action reaction guns of august scenario that we tried to defuse
5183248 we started to check and around 11 50 i got confirmation that russian armor was coming in
5183249 to do otherwise he said would have been to cede georgian sovereignty he had no choice he said
5183250 during these intense exchanges between the leadership here and me when they said they were going to lift the cease fire we said dont put your forces in harms way because you cannot prevail
5183251 and the response was we understand that we are going to shell the road on which the russians are approaching and try to keep them back thats what they said

5183258 i had only 9 000 they were already bringing in new soldiers they had a chance to rest and our soldiers were becoming tired and more tired because i had no additional forces to change them after two days of battle they were too tired

5183499 out of the blue in front of ellie and hayley i felt a massive surge of anxiety overwhelm me like a huge wave
5183500 i started thinking seriously about doing myself harm i knew i didnt want to carry on living like this
5183501 i knew i no longer had any say in the matter the illness had come back the thought of what i was doing hit me like a kick in the guts i would probably never again experience the great highs hard work and joy of playing for england
5183502 weve seen more foreclosures than at any time since the great depression
5183503 over the last few decades revolutions in technology and communication have made it so that corporations can send good jobs wherever theres an internet connection
5183504 with this most recent supply contract we are looking forward to building a relationship with xl telecom amp energy limited as well as expanding our presence in india

5183512 all of us stepped into this journey with great faith and great belief that humanity would carry us through from town to town and thats exactly what happened
5183513 for me to walk from leeds to london is probably the single most difficult thing i could ever have imagined
5183514 i still cant quite believe that i have achieved it but i never gave up because of the people that never gave up on me
5183515 one of the biggest predictors of reporting sexual problems is having anxiety depression stress or saying your mental health is poor
5183516 if someone is having trouble in the bedroom treating those issues can very well improve the situation
5183517 we know that alcohol at a moderate level improves health
5183518 it seems to improve cardiovascular functioning sex is exercise and it may be that its improving all over functionality which makes women more likely to be sexually active
5183519 people are more likely to forget about those things that made them angry that are getting in the way of their sex life
5183520 it was a pain that hit my heart that has not gone away
5183521 theres no way that my daughter would have done that to herself she loved life she had dreams and hopes and plans she loved her family
5183522 it was like her death all over again to know that my sweet baby was laying somewhere with no one to help her being murdered and then set on fire it was the worst most horrific thing i have ever heard
5183523 we were making plans to be together and she was making plans to do things with her family
5183524 on her 20th birthday i was looking at my daughter in a box
5183525 we should have been celebrating her life but it was stolen from her
5183526 my daughter was a very strong person when she went through basic training her drill sergeants talked about how mentally tough she was in addition to that she came from a supportive and close knit family
5183527 her lip was busted her nose was broke from right to left and concaved her teeth were knocked loose and she had a cracked mandible
5183528 we have a picture of her vaginal area and her vaginal area is tore all to hell
5183529 part of the wall is hanging out so this was a cruel and vicious rape in addition somebody poured what appeared to be lye into her vagina and we think they did that to destroy dna evidence
5183530 when you hear about what her parents have had to face after her death after this terrible thing has happened something that is almost incomprehensible to think that someone who has put their life on the line for their country then their parents have to spend years of delays and denials just to get a clear answer about why and how their daughter died
5183531 what we know for sure is that the answers the johnsons are being given are clearly insufficient
5183532 literally everything from the armys own investigators shows that a suicide is highly unlikely if not impossible and we also know that lavenas case is not singular it is actually connected to a pattern of other rape murder cases involving women in the military that are either brushed to the side or covered up
5183533 that a female soldier in iraq is more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire is sickening
5183534 this crisis has reached epidemic proportions and threatens our national security better training and rigorous prosecutions are needed to make clear to soldiers and the command structure that bright red lines have been drawn
5183535 we tell all of our marines that sexual assault is not compatible with marine corps standards it is not compatible with our core values and will not be tolerated
5183536 she would try to reassure me that being there right on the base that she would be okay but she was in a place with a bunch of satanic predators that wore the same uniform that she did
5183537 it is painful to do but i have to do what i have to do because they took her voice and silenced it so i have to speak for her and for all the other young ladies that have been taken away in such a cruel and horrible way
5183538 somebody committed cold blooded murder and we want them brought to justice

5183544 it was a small intimate get together for friends and family with saif and kareena calling up people personally it was a drinks and dinner party and everybody who attended had a rocking time kareena wanted to make it a special evening for saif it was definitely more organised and better than katrinas birthday party marred by the infamous srk salman fight
5183545 though salman was invited by both kareena shes acting in his home production main aur mrs khanna and saif he chose to stay away as did his sister arpita and brother sohail khan and his wife seema they attended ghais party instead kareenas best friend amrita arora went public for the first time with her new boyfriend shakeel ladak as did dino and lara who came together kareena had also invited her kambakht ishq producer sajid nadiadwala but he was down with viral fever and couldnt come

5183559 working in a country and culture not your own is an enormous privilege and working for one of its iconic companies is a privilege amplified

5183561 i came here expecting to stay for one to two months three years later mary sue and i leave having been welcomed guests in this wonderful country
5183562 it was hard for some to give up the idea that telstra is community property
5183563 the cultural change required by privatisation was difficult both for telstra and for the government

5183580 ich hatte danach m chtig zu tun um meine position zu verteidigen am ende musste ich dann noch knapp einen platz abgeben
5183581 wir wollten auf dem n rburgring eigentlich um die podestpl tze mitfahren von daher ist das ergebnis insgesamt am ende entt uschend
5183582 doch bei solchen unfallgeschichten die halt im motorsport passieren kann man nichts machen philip hat mit dem besch digten auto noch das beste aus der situation herausgeholt
5183583 ich bin den ganzen tag mit kontrolliertem risiko gefahren und konnte alle angriffe abwehren
5183584 ich bin sehr zufrieden und auch sehr optimistisch f r das rennen
5183585 in den freien trainingssitzungen haben wir uns ein ausgezeichnetes set up f rs rennen erarbeitet und sind bereits viel versprechende long runs gefahren ein so gut ausbalanciertes rennauto wie den rs spyder auf dem n rburgring zu fahren macht au erdem gro en spa
5183586 unsere reifentests mitte juli in estoril haben sich ausgezahlt wir sind sehr gut sortiert
5183587 dass jos schneller war als casper sehen wir als einen besonderen ansporn an das rennen wird sicher hart bei der distanz von 1 000 kilometern und mit einem feld von 46 fahrzeugen auf diesem kurvenreichen kurs muss man sechs stunden lang voll konzentriert sein und darf sich keine fehler erlauben
5183588 als rennfahrer rgert man sich erstmal dar ber nur noch sechster statt vierter zu sein
5183589 aber im grunde ist das entscheidende dass wir f rs rennen ein sehr gutes auto haben wir haben uns von session zu session gesteigert und f hlen uns insofern gut pr pariert
5183590 uns fehlt nur ein starkes zehntel auf den schnelleren ferrari insofern gehen wir optimistisch ins rennen denn die bisherigen l ufe der lms haben gezeigt dass alex und ich ber die distanz zuverl ssig und konstant sind uns fehlt 2008 noch ein sieg und diesen hier beim heimrennen zu holen w re einfach nur sch n

5183640 phil has great integrity and has not been afraid to show leadership often speaking the truth even when it was inconvenient for established interests to hear it
5183641 i think i played a decent match of course i could have done better and should have won it but still im carrying a lot of positives
5183642 having lost to her twice in the past both were close matches i was determined to make amends this time but towards the end things didnt go my way her backhand was better than mine and i was missing my smashes as well
5183643 she was hardly missing anything all of a sudden she came blazing all guns and i just could not cope with that
5183644 still it was overall a great experience and im happy that i tried my best

5183649 game the system as weve seen in this housing crisis
5183650 those who play by the rules and keep the faith have gotten the shaft and those who cut corners and cut deals have been rewarded
5183651 i was relaxed and in control and that is what the plan was
5183652 it is the biggest atmosphere i have been in i let the crowd really energize me and bring me home
5183653 i thought i should shut it down and not risk hurting it more
5183654 but at the last minute in my last run during practice it cramped and there is a little bit of soreness there
5183655 i realized i had become a sort of a guru about what one needs to do to make a house into a healthy home so i started allergybuyers com to sell helpful products to people like me
5183656 i have always been most interested in the green aspects of what we were doing at allergy buyers and that really goes back a very long way in my history
5183657 forty five years ago i had solar panels on my house in england my family were environmentalists before anybody ever really used the term
5183658 we have products that if people use them can actually make an impact on the world in a positive way its very exciting to conceive of a business where youre making a profit and a difference at the same time
5183659 we still focus on home products but the impact on the greater community is enormous
5183660 its amazing how something so simple can make such a difference and save so much money too
5183661 the kinds of things that ive been living my life around in my home environment suddenly became more interesting to the outside world
5183662 but its like wow its taken everyone 35 years to get it thats like half a lifetime

5183665 we like to choose products that make life better but also dont ask the consumer to do anything special or unique to help conserve electricity or water or you name it
5183666 most of our products if youre a lazy person are a no brainer
5183667 so if youre going to paint a room for 20 you could save a whole lot of money
5183668 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5183669 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence

5183673 la fe es el abandono de nuestra propia seguridad y la disposici n para hallar seguridad s lo en el m s all invisible de dios
5183674 hace sucumbir a los hombres en su ansia de seguridad
5183675 que alguien se hubiese adelantado a echar garrocha a ese toro tan bravo antes que yo porque quisiera mucho aquella gloria
5183676 vale m s que sufra un solo hombre que el que padezca desdoro tan santo tribunal
5183677 eigentlich hat die kunst sich immer sehr bem ht sich der mode zu verweigern aber heute ist sie mit ihr eine symbiose eingegangen inzwischen ist mode auch so eine art inszenierung die weit ber das dekorative hinausgeht
5183678 ja doch sie kann einen mit dem ansinnen des bleibenwollens auch bedrohen nicht wahr ich meine alles ist verg nglich au erdem ist es ja auch nicht so dass man nach einer saison alles wegwirft ich entdecke oft kleider die drei vier jahre alt sind und denke ach so etwas sch nes f llt dir heute nicht mehr ein ich geh re ja noch zu den dinosauriern der mode die alles selbst machen
5183679 ja und irritation ich finde kleider die aussehen als br uchte man anziehhilfen unerotisch designer wie alexander mcqueen foltern frauen mit korsetts und st tzstangen meine kleider sollen so aussehen als ob jemand wie brigitte bardot direkt aus dem meer kommt wie damals in cannes ich sah das als junge die brauchte nur ein schlampiges t shirt dagegen wirkten alle anderen hollywood stars auf einmal wie alte gebrauchte cadillacs
5183680 guter stil ist es souver n mit seinen fehlern umgehen zu k nnen das haben frauen wie jennifer lopez vorgemacht mit ihrem viel zu dicken arsch ich finde das nat rliche unzul ngliche viel aufreizender als das glatte
5183681 ich versuche den zeitgeist nicht zu treffen denn der geht vor ber und dann stehst du dumm da allein auf der party heute werden die sachen durch die medien so bekannt gemacht wenn ich dann eine 60 j hrige mit der must have bag sehe sieht die frau doppelt so alt aus wie ihre tasche man kann sich auch ins abseits shoppen
5183682 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5183683 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5183684 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5183685 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5183686 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5183687 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5183688 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5183689 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action
5183690 would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5183691 people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5183692 we have to invent a new language with regard to russia that is what the european union is trying to do
5183693 the west is losing the new cold war while hardly having noticed that it has started
5183694 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5183695 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5183696 im not interested in a vice president who i send off to go to funerals
5183697 i want somebody who is going to roll up their sleeves and be willing to work
5183698 i am aware of the enhanced importance of this issue given my age
5183699 fail to act and whats been accomplished will be lost
5183700 a lot of companies turn to youtube to raise awareness of global concerns like renewable energy climate change or poverty now socially conscious businesses are following suit by leveraging their brands to showcase important issues and encourage people to get involved
5183701 its the companys opportunity to get into pretty personal communication and interaction with its own customers
5183702 they strengthen their brand by putting a face to things customers can hear and see them talk
5183703 the earthkeeper channel on youtube is one of several vehicles by which we seek to engage consumers in a dialogue around the environment and climate change
5183704 the reason we chose to sponsor a contest on youtube is because video is such a popular and powerful medium that allows consumers to explore very creative stimulating methods of communicating their messages
5183705 companies have an interest to be perceived as socially responsible but they want to sell their products at the same time
5183706 youtube is a new vehicle and companies are offering these types of media therefore the spots are not completely altruistic theres an element of both selling and doing good
5183707 he not only indicated the problem of climate change but he also set a new form of demonstration short clips brief presentations
5183708 no company can ignore the whole climate problem i have no doubt that the pr department of every company is telling their bosses we have to have a presence because its part of being in business today
5183709 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5183710 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5183711 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5183712 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability

5183714 we simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late the science is clear the global warming debate is over
5183715 americans are coming to understand that global temperatures have actually cooled over the last 10 years and are predicted to continue cooling over the next 10
5183716 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening
5183717 if you take the last 30 years its completely evident that its going up
5183718 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
5183719 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
5183720 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians

5183723 insurgents detonated a vehicle borne ied improvised explosive device outside a us base in khost province today killing nine afghan local nationals and wounding another 13 according to initial reports
5183724 it was a suicide car bombing against the gates of the salerno camp
5183725 moments later a second car bomber came and wanted to detonate his bombs police identified him and opened fire on him he came out of the car and escaped on a motorcycle and disappeared
5183726 a group of american christians who had more than 300 bibles confiscated by chinese officials when they arrived in china is refusing to leave the airport until they get the books back their leader said monday
5183727 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5183728 we havent stolen your gun were simply taking care of it for a while sure itll eventually disappear but shit happens when the state tries to be too perfect
5183729 raja petra is not a bona fide journalist or an independent news provider
5183730 it was extremely hard it was hot i think it was a great course for a triathlon it was a really tough course
5183731 i feel very proud and honoured to be an australian with a gold medal around my neck at the olympic games
5183732 i believe we came so close in sydney and athens that this makes up for those very close defeats
5183733 i dont feel any regret about not going to athens you move on and you deal with it but to come from a nation thats so strong in terms of triathlon its a fantastic feeling to finally bring home a gold medal
5183734 i guess now i have an idea of what the fans are going through when theyre watching basketball games
5183735 the president will address the nation at 1 00pm 0700 gmt
5183736 he is a wise man he is a very experienced man and he has seen the writing on the wall
5183737 he has seen the sentiments of not just the elected representatives but various institutions who all asked him to move in a particular way and do not destabilise things here
5183738 his political fate has been sealed whatever he says doesnt matter
5183739 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5183740 the clarity over the past year has improved by at least 2 5 feet
5183741 i know what fire does and with global warming and the water issues we have fire looms its ugly head much more formidably than it has in the past
5183742 reporters are grumbling more and more that the campaign is acting like the prom queen they gripe that it is arrogant and control ling and the campaigns own belief that obama is poised to make history isnt endearing either the press certainly helped obama get so far so fast the question is how far can he get if his campaign alienates them
5183743 end of the affair barack obama and the press break up
5183744 the problem is not that democrats are monolithically pro choice or anti school prayer its that by dropping the class language that once distinguished them sharply from republicans they have left themselves vulnerable to cultural wedge issues like guns and abortion and the rest whose hallucinatory appeal would ordinarily be overshadowed by material concerns we are in an environment where republicans talks constantly about class in a coded way to be sure but where democrats are afraid to bring it up
5183745 if its a poor choice you spend the next 60 days worrying about the other plane
5183746 every four years you usually get to look at these guys try to go native think of president bush in his brush clearing outfit
5183747 but if youre president the day job does involve a suit and it can be awkward when youre not in work clothes
5183748 everyone knows how fast a picture can go from local novelty to worldwide laughingstock
5183749 it shows hes not trying to be like everyone else its part of the visual message that hes crafting in an odd little way it adds to the not pandering in a conservative middle america suit like a 50 year old tax lawyer wears
5183750 it would be inappropriate if mccain looked as stylish as obama he has a different physique hes a different age and hes much more conservative
5183751 he does have occasional fun with a wider flashy tie
5183752 not all senators can wear that but it looks right on him
5183753 you could put baracks head on johns body and say hes gained a little weight but you wouldnt notice he was in different clothes
5183754 people try to put us down just because we get around
5183755 the further down the street you went the badder it got
5183756 on august 21 there will be a national premier of the film in 400 theaters across the nation the film purports to be an entertaining analysis of the serious financial situation facing america regarding its national debt and fiscal irresponsibility
5183757 from its trailer and description it sounds suspiciously like a hokey concoction ala al gores an inconvenient truth put together by louis xvis financial ministers on the eve of the storming of the bastille blaming all our troubles on sunspots or the humble snail darter
5183758 the premier will also feature a live panel discussion after the film of distinguished experts filling in to the suckers who viewed this fiasco what they just saw they include peterson walker billionaire investor warren buffet and cato institute chairman william me too niskanen
5183759 heres what we wont be hearing from these esteemed gentlemen
5183760 poor david rockefeller his grandfather senator nelson aldrich created this monstrosity the federal reserve thats responsible for all that we saw in the film and now the ignorant masses will be coming after him in a blind fit of revenge theyll be coming after all of us like they did the aristocrats in france were closing down the harold pratt house in new york and moving the cfr headquarters to a secure bunker in virginia
5183761 you know i should have earned less and listened more to my dad the heroic
5183762 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
5183763 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
5183764 mija you can be the first woman president if you want to be
5183765 i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived
5183766 i think the sound of a baseball hitting a golve is the greatest sound in all of sports
5183767 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5183768 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5183769 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5183770 dr paul is non interventionist and does not want us intervening in the affairs of others
5183771 its certainly good to have attention drawn to the issues of the libertarian party
5183772 being a third party candidate is very different a lot of republicans like to donate to republicans you just have to keep on plugging
5183773 it could be that a few thousand votes tip the balance
5183774 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
5183775 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
5183776 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
5183777 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
5183778 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
5183779 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
5183780 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
5183781 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
5183782 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
5183783 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
5183784 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
5183785 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
5183786 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
5183787 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
5183788 we want young chinese girls or boys to get such an impression from this place that 20 years from now theyll want to work for johnson amp johnson
5183789 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5183790 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5183791 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5183792 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5183793 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5183794 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5183795 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
5183796 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
5183797 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
5183798 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
5183799 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower
5183800 one million to die from smog related illnesses in the next two years
5183801 the most problematic aspect of the cmas research is the assumption that air pollution kills
5183802 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
5183803 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
5183804 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
5183805 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
5183806 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
5183807 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
5183808 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5183809 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5183810 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5183811 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5183812 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5183813 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5183814 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5183815 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5183816 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5183817 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5183818 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5183819 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5183820 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5183821 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5183822 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5183823 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5183824 he was one of our most senior and experienced panzer officers he had been famous for his icy calm and exceptional bravery both in the first world war and in spain and was now to prove his ability once again
5183825 as to your troops you can show them no other way than that to victory or death
5183826 i was staggered at the exactness of his knowledge he seemed to know as much about our position as i did myself
5183827 highly thought of by the english relations between him and the guards is excellent

5183834 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5183835 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5183836 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5183837 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5183838 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5183839 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5183840 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5183841 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
5183842 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
5183843 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
5183844 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
5183845 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
5183846 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly
5183847 a military force serving the interests of the democratic party
5183848 revive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country
5183849 means confusion distraction of business and the reopening of wounds now happily healed
5183850 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
5183851 with the election of harry truman democrats began the fight to bring down the final barriers of race
5183852 democrats began to bring down the final barriers of race
5183853 we love the american people its the policies of your government we dont like
5183854 the prophets endure and can only be ignored at the risk of our own despair
5183855 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5183856 he is god the one god to whom the creatures turn for their needs he begets not nor was he begotten and there is none like him
5183857 children of israel worship god my lord and your lord whoever associates partners in worship with god then god has forbidden paradise for him and his home is the fire hell for the wrongdoers god is not a trinity god has said in the quran
5183858 this dog is feeling the same thirst that i felt
5183859 messenger of god are we rewarded for kindness towards animals
5183860 there is no true god but god and muhammad is the messenger prophet of god
5183861 and whoever seeks a religion other than islam it will not be accepted from him and he will be one of the losers in the hereafter
5183862 there is no true god deity but god allah 1 and muhammad is the messenger prophet of god
5183863 o god you are my servant and i am your lord
5183864 messenger of god are we rewarded for kindness towards animals
5183865 o messenger of god who among the people is the most worthy of my good companionship
5183866 this saying means 1 and muhammad is the messenger prophet of god
5183867 son of adam did you ever face any misery did you ever experience any hardship
5183868 no by god o lord i never faced any misery and i never experienced any hardship
5183869 would that we might return to the world then we would not reject the verses of our lord but we would be of the believers
5183870 son of adam did you ever see any good did you ever experience any blessing
5183871 give me your right hand so that i may give you my pledge of loyalty
5183872 it has been a great pleasure for me to help clarify statements in the quran about human development
5183873 does this mean that you believe that the quran is the word of god
5183874 thinking where muhammad came from i think it is almost impossible that he could have known about things like the common origin of the universe because scientists have only found out within the last few years with very complicated and advanced technological methods that this is the case
5183875 somebody who did not know something about nuclear physics fourteen hundred years ago could not i think be in a position to find out from his own mind for instance that the earth and the heavens had the same origin
5183876 the motivation and the foresight to plan and initiate movements occur in the anterior portion of the frontal lobes the prefrontal area
5183877 in relation to its involvement in motivation the prefrontal area is also thought to be the functional center for aggression
5183878 pycnocline zone with a marked density discontinuity separating the two layers
5183879 and he sends down hail from mountains clouds in the sky
5183880 the way it was explained to me is that muhammad was a very ordinary man he could not read didnt know how to write in fact he was an illiterate and were talking about twelve actually about fourteen hundred years ago you have someone illiterate making profound pronouncements and statements and that are amazingly accurate about scientific nature and i personally cant see how this could be a mere chance there are too many accuracies and like dr moore i have no difficulty in my mind that this is a divine inspiration or revelation which led him to these statements professor persaud has included some quranic verses and sayings of the prophet muhammad in some of his books he has also presented these verses and sayings of the prophet muhammad 2 dr joe leigh simpson is the chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology professor of obstetrics and gynecology and professor of molecular and human genetics at the baylor college of medicine houston texas usa formerly he was professor of ob gyn and the chairman of the department of ob gyn at the university of tennessee memphis tennessee usa he was also the president of the american fertility society he has received many awards including the association of professors of obstetrics and gynecology public recognition award in 1992 professor simpson studied the following two sayings of the prophet muhammad in every one of you all components of your creation are collected together in your mothers womb by forty days 2 if forty two nights have passed over the embryo god sends an angel to it who shapes it and creates its hearing vision skin flesh and bones 3 he studied these two sayings of the prophet muhammad extensively noting that the first forty days constitute a clearly distinguishable stage of embryo genesis he was particularly impressed by the absolute precision and accuracy of those sayings of the prophet muhammad then during one conference he gave the following opinion that have been noted provide us with a specific time table for the main embryological development before forty days again the point has been made i think repeatedly by other speakers this morning these hadeeths could not have been obtained on the basis of the scientific knowledge that was available at the time of their writing it follows i think that not only there is no conflict between genetics and religion but in fact religion can guide science by adding revelation to some of the traditional scientific approaches that there exist statements in the quran shown centuries later to be valid which support knowledge in the quran having been derived from god
5183881 summary the quran describes not only the development of external form but emphasizes also the internal stages the stages inside the embryo of its creation and development emphasizing major events recognized by contemporary science
5183882 as a scientist i can only deal with things which i can specifically see
5183883 i find it very interesting that this sort of information is in the ancient scriptures of the holy quran and i have no way of knowing where they would come from but i think it is extremely interesting that they are there and that this work is going on to discover it the meaning of some of the passages
5183884 well i would think it must be the divine being 5 dr gerald c goeringer is course director and associate professor of medical embryology at the department of cell biology school of medicine georgetown university washington dc usa during the eighth saudi medical conference in riyadh saudi arabia professor goeringer stated the following in the presentation of his research paper aayahs quranic verses is contained a rather comprehensive description of human development from the time of commingling of the gametes through organogenesis no such distinct and complete record of human development such as classification terminology and description existed previously in most if not all instances this description antedates by many centuries the recording of the various stages of human embryonic and fetal development recorded in the traditional scientific literature
5183885 i am very much impressed by finding true astronomical facts in the quran and for us the modern astronomers have been studying very small pieces of the universe
5183886 during the last three years i became interested in the quran from my study and what i have learned from this conference i believe that everything that has been recorded in the quran fourteen hundred years ago must be the truth that can be proved by the scientific means since the prophet muhammad could neither read nor write muhammad must be a messenger who relayed this truth which was revealed to him as an enlightenment by the one who is eligible as the creator this creator must be god therefore i think this is the time to say la ilaha illa allah there is no god to worship except allah god muhammadur rasoolu allah muhammad is messenger prophet of allah god lastly i must congratulate for the excellent and highly successful arrangement for this conference i have gained not only from the scientific point of view and religious point of view but also the great chance of meeting many well known scientists and making many new friends among the participants the most precious thing of all that i have gained by coming to this place is la ilaha illa allah muhammadur rasoolu allah and to have become a muslim
5183887 i will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers i will put my words in his mouth and he will tell them everything i command him if anyone does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name i myself will call him to account
5183888 now this was johns testimony when the jews of jerusalem sent priests and levites to ask him who he was
5183889 he will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth in his law the islands will put their hope
5183890 in the name of god the most gracious the most merciful
5183891 for it is do and do do and do rule on rule rule on rule a little here a little there
5183892 if anyone does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name i myself will call him to account
5183893 o my nephew we would sight three new moons in two months without lighting a fire to cook a meal in the prophets houses
5183894 the two black things dates and water but the prophet did not see bread made from fine flour from the time god sent him as a prophet until he died
5183895 if you want money we will collect enough money for you so that you will be the richest one of us
5183896 wenn mein mann glaubt dass er im kaffeehaus ber politik herumschreien muss soll er das ruhig machen ber wirklich wichtiges entscheide ich
5183897 wir m chten mehr bewegungsfreiheit haben uns beruflich besser entfalten k nnen auto fahren d rfen und manches andere aber glauben sie ja nicht dass wir die westlichen frauen beneiden
5183898 der pr sident saakaschwili anm nicht l nger ein gespr chspartner f r verhandlungen sein kann und dass es besser w re wenn er zur cktritt
5183899 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5183900 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5183901 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5183902 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5183903 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5183904 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5183905 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5183906 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5183907 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5183908 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5183909 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5183910 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5183911 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5183912 we are very disappointed liu xiang has been training very hard since athens to try and win the gold medal in beijing and has been under intense pressure
5183913 until last saturday liu xiang was in very good shape
5183914 but when he trained on saturday he aggravated an old injury in his tendon and the pain intensified
5183915 we didnt realise it was so serious nobody knew that he couldnt compete at the time
5183916 i dont have to defend anything the 2004 medal is mine nobody can take it away
5183917 i am here to shoot for the 2008 medal we are all doing the same trying to shoot for that gold the legs feel good im ready to go
5183918 but i too have my expectations and i havent come here to be second
5183919 its going to take guts heart and power if you want to medal you have got to run a smart race probably the best race of your life
5183920 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
5183921 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
5183922 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
5183923 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
5183924 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
5183925 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
5183926 we have in this country an overabundance of supply of health care services
5183927 so as we look to find ways to help stem the increase in cost associated with medical benefits we have to realize thats money coming out of revenue for a provider of care
5183928 the economic cost estimate to central new york for smoking is 763 million
5183929 individuals and society we can act on what we see in the mirror
5183930 you folks cant sustain that we cant as a community sustain that
5183931 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5183932 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5183933 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5183934 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5183935 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5183936 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5183937 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5183938 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5183939 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5183940 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5183941 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5183942 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5183943 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5183944 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5183945 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5183946 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5183947 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5183948 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5183949 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5183950 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5183951 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5183952 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5183953 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5183954 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5183955 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5183956 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5183957 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5183958 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5183959 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5183960 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5183961 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5183962 vor mehreren jahren stand in der presse dass ein monsterwels bei bregenz ein boot gerammt und versenkt hat der angler der darin sa hat nicht berlebt
5183963 was lauert denn da in den seen des europ ischen festlands
5183964 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
5183965 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
5183966 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
5183967 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
5183968 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
5183969 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
5183970 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
5183971 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
5183972 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
5183973 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
5183974 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
5183975 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
5183976 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
5183977 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5183978 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5183979 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
5183980 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
5183981 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5183982 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
5183983 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5183984 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
5183985 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
5183986 i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
5183987 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
5183988 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
5183989 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
5183990 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
5183991 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
5183992 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
5183993 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
5183994 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5183995 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5183996 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5183997 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5183998 what do we have to give up to reach the cost of a trillion and a half to three trillion dollars theres going to have to be some pain some sacrifice on the part of the american taxpayer isnt there
5183999 the real way to bring gasoline prices down is not by going back to try more of the same things that have not worked in the past but to say wait a minute now is the time for a really dramatic shift over to renewable energy
5184000 he did not force gore to debate a crackpot from cloud cuckoo land who is still waiting for the evidence to arrive about human sources of radical climate change
5184001 the unsupported assumption catastrophic global warming follows burning fossil fuels requires immediate action
5184002 the unsupported assumption that the world is more than 6000 years old
5184003 he did not force gore to debate a crackpot from cloud cuckoo land who is still waiting for the evidence to arrive about human sources of radical climate change
5184004 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
5184005 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
5184006 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
5184007 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
5184008 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
5184009 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
5184010 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
5184011 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
5184012 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
5184013 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
5184014 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5184015 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5184016 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5184017 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5184018 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5184019 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5184020 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5184021 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
5184022 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
5184023 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
5184024 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
5184025 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5184026 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
5184027 i think that if they are illegal then they should not be able to work in this country that is part of the principle of comprehensive reform which were going to crack down on employers who are hiring them and taking advantage of them but i also want to give them a pathway so that they can earn citizenship earn a legal status start learning english pay a significant fine and go to the back of the line but they can stay here
5184028 if you look at folks of color even women theyre more successful in the democratic party than they are in the white uh excuse me in the republican party because we just give more opportunity to folks who are hard working people who are immigrants and come from members of minority groups
5184029 i give you every seed bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it they will be yours for food genesis 1 29
5184030 i give you every seed bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it they will be yours for food
5184031 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
5184032 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5184033 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5184034 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5184035 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5184036 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5184037 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5184038 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5184039 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5184040 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
5184041 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
5184042 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
5184043 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
5184044 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5184045 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
5184046 we cant rely on the media to hold him accountable in fact the sheer brazenness of the lies is attracting even more coverage the media have shown that they arent going to stop him
5184047 although the national interest to generate more power overrides all other concerns it is important to appreciate that part of the caldera is protected as a gazzetted forest and the crater has several socio economic ecological cultural and religious attributes
5184048 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5184049 decided that the democrats have become more moderate on abortion so lets assume for the sake of this post that they are right about the platform language what does that mean in the real world absolutely nothing
5184050 who is above the pay grade of the president of the united states
5184051 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5184052 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5184053 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5184054 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5184055 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5184056 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5184057 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5184058 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5184059 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5184060 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5184061 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5184062 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5184063 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5184064 an emotion is a mental and bodily reaction marked by strong feeling and psychological responses that prepare the body for action
5184065 so happiness involves more than feeling good all the time it involves living
5184066 this car sure is nice nice ride look at all the cars and trucks wow they really like to fly down this road
5184067 wow this gal has some nice fill in with your favorite body part
5184068 i love you from the tips of your toes to the top of your head and everything in between

5184071 oh thats better the girls can look at me now
5184072 oh thats the smell of cut grass i wonder how long ago they cut it i wonder who cut it etc
5184073 before thought everything is one after thought everything is different
5184074 i have learnt silence from the talkative toleration from the intolerant and kindness from the unkind yet strange i am ungrateful to these teachers
5184075 its hard to believe people can be like that but they can people will do some terrible things
5184076 your dad asked that i call you hes been looking for his wife and wants his car back weve been trying to calm him down and redirect him but nothing seems to be working would you mind talking to him
5184077 im worried about your mom i cant find her anywhere she never said goodbye to me and i dont know where she is
5184078 she probably went shopping and is staying out at chrissys
5184079 i keep expecting to see her to talk to her but i cant find her anywhere
5184080 oh im so sorry let me give you the name of the best oncologist cardiologist in the state ill keep you in my thoughts and prayers if you ever want to talk just call

5184088 i think its in the shop for a tune up dad i can drive you until you get it back
5184089 he was not in the abyss but he could see it and at times people whom he knew had dropped in and counted no more
5184090 we wanted the best in the business and his work at the brisbane lions was instrumental in building a playing list that won three straight premierships and he has built a talented young list at the western bulldogs
5184091 building this football club is one of the great challenges in football and scotts experience his skills and his knowledge of young football talent is perfectly suited to making this a success
5184092 a role like this is extremely rare in football so it will be exciting for me
5184093 i have been extremely fortunate to work at the western bulldogs for a long period of time where i have seen the club go from strength to strength with an exciting and innovative brand of football and a real team environment
5184094 i know that the team we have set up will have a very successful five year period and no one wants to see them succeed more than me
5184095 scott will have the chance to create a team from scratch which is something that any recruitment manager would love to have the opportunity to do
5184096 but we are fortunate that we have a football manager such as james fantasia who has a credentialed recruiting background and comes from a club adelaide with a strong recruiting record

5184101 but many enjoyed the return of german pride and many more were too busy to care i was one of those who just thought the nazis were a bunch of fools so the majority just sat back and let it all happen then before we knew it they owned us and we had lost control and the end of the world had come my family lost everything i ended up in a concentration camp and the allies destroyed my factories

5184107 it is kind of surreal it is a feeling that leaves me elated the one thing while doing khatron ke khiladi was that the journey should be fantastic and it has been just that
5184108 for me winning was great am not saying no to that but the journey of reaching the finals was worth everything it is actually worth more than winning winning was just like the cherry on the pudding it was a thrilling experience

5184154 como se ha visto son partidos de peque os detalles
5184155 hay en juego un t tulo y se ha visto un buen partido de futbol y muy intenso
5184156 a estas alturas de pretemporada no va todos redondo y faltan algunas cosas t cticas y t cnicas

5184163 est en forma y con muchas ganas por lo que espero que pueda ser su temporada
5184164 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
5184165 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
5184166 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
5184167 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
5184168 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
5184169 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
5184170 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
5184171 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
5184172 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
5184173 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
5184174 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
5184175 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
5184176 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
5184177 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
5184178 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
5184179 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
5184180 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
5184181 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
5184182 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
5184183 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
5184184 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
5184185 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
5184186 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
5184187 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
5184188 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
5184189 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
5184190 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
5184191 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
5184192 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
5184193 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
5184194 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
5184195 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
5184196 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
5184197 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
5184198 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
5184199 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
5184200 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
5184201 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
5184202 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
5184203 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
5184204 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
5184205 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
5184206 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
5184207 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
5184208 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
5184209 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
5184210 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
5184211 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
5184212 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
5184213 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine

5184221 among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
5184222 we are here emplacing those barriers and we are helping the coalition forces while were here
5184223 we bring in roughly 80 barriers a night and they can emplace as many as 100 per night
5184224 we havent been able to put forces on the other side of barriers and thats what the ia does
5184225 the idea of emplacing those barriers is to isolate the hot neighborhoods from the safe neighborhoods
5184226 this is a joint mission between the ia and mnd baghdad to help isolate sadr city from the criminal elements seeking refuge in sadr city and maneuvering out
5184227 it goes into the story of king saul and david and goliath

5184229 king silas in the script and then this young up and coming kid called david who i think hello is trying to take my throne he wants to be king and its good to be king nobody wants not to be king
5184230 well see if the follow up scripts are as good as the pilot
5184231 let me tell you its a really difficult way to make films
5184232 you can see why people use a lot of cg because theres nothing easier than just shooting an empty plate and creating it all in the computer six months later to put the stunts in this movie on screen as spectacular as they are to do it all for real and not kill anybody was a huge undertaking and everyone was very excited about the idea of doing that
5184233 i was heavily influenced by movies made in the 70s and 80s that i grew up watching
5184234 walter hills the driver peckinpahs the getaway french connection bullitt road warrior death race 2000 i mean the list goes on and in particular road warrior where i remember i borrowed my mothers mini to drive to the cinema to go and see it me and my friends and i remember being so energized when i left the cinema that i just wanted to take that mini and drive it into the side of a truck and i dont get that visceral thrill from many action movies nowadays because its not real you know you can see that its cg and its spectacular but you dont have that kind of visceral thrill of seeing real things get crunched up and the real sense of danger that can give you and i wanted to go back to making one of those movies
5184235 nobody had ever done that before taking a 75 foot truck driving it at 60 miles an hour to a dead stop and seeing what happens
5184236 seeing statham do all his own driving it was really stressful
5184237 theres some great scenes like when he does the 180 in the mustang you can see the g force on statham when hes doing it i mean thats because hes really in a car driving at 60 miles an hour and throwing it into a 180 and you cant fake that and i think it gives the movie a real sense of reality
5184238 i did take all her miniskirts i told her one night that her skirt was too short she came down the stairs and i was like god mum you are 50
5184239 hes not as cool as youd think hed be hes fun but everyone thinks he would just want to party all the time but well hes just dad he worries
5184240 as much as we all love to talk about who should be the announcer for this or that broadcast and how good or bad various announcers are ive long maintained that announcers dont mean much to fans

5184242 while the committee is disturbed by the extension of the maximum period of detention without charge of terrorist suspects under the terrorism act 2006 from 14 days to 28 days it is even more disturbed by the proposed extension of this maximum period of detention under the counterterrorism bill from 28 days to 42 days

5184252 fayetteville arkansas offense had perhaps its best day so far on thursday as its quarterbacks and receivers made big play after big play on the practice football fields behind donald w reynolds razorback stadium
5184253 we can have all the walkthroughs we want but to get it to where the speed of our offense operates we have to make the adjustment
5184254 we have to face the challenge and we didnt win today
5184255 hes physical fluid and athletic hes starting to connect the dots the front line is coming along really well i really like the development of our young kids ernest mitchell gives us power and thats an element that we havent had and he has some quicks

5184258 a lot of people thought it was because of grades but i go to class every day
5184259 it definitely means a lot just getting a win but it also means a lot just being able to finally get one in san diego
5184260 any time you come home you want to do the best you possibly can
5184261 we werent able to really go out there and succeed
5184262 i think thats more the focus its all about the team when you start focusing on your own goals youre going to get yourself in trouble the ultimate goal is to get to the playoffs and get to the world series one win doesnt really mean anything a 5 2 record would have been a lot better

5184266 drivers who kill through carelessness will no longer be able to walk away from court with just a fine
5184267 a moments distraction can make the difference between life and death
5184268 reading or composing text messages over a period of time
5184269 allowing distractions to affect your standard of driving is not acceptable and will now be more appropriately punished under the law
5184270 it would help if we had more traffic police to act as a deterrent to stop these offences taking place before they end in death and tragedy

5184273 honestly i think for the last three months he has been feeling a tremendous amount of pressure
5184274 it has been revealing itself in various responses whether it be heavy legs or breathing difficulties its not really a physical issue
5184275 we forget its easy to train the physical component what we need to get good at is to be able to address the emotional component its complicated by the fact the focus is so intense on one or two select people thats really what it is yeah he was sick but was that a health issue or the result of the stress he was feeling
5184276 i know whats going to be said and hes an easy target
5184277 my father was telling me about harry jerome winning a bronze medal at the 1964 rome olympics with a hamstring injury and everyone was calling him a choker thats a challenge tyler is going to face how you respond to this defines you as a person

5184279 i couldnt really get out of my bed until two days ago
5184280 i thought i was over it but it seems like it still has taken a lot out of my body
5184281 it basically felt like half my speed was missing i got to one slow constant speed couldnt pick it up from there
5184282 the experience of life shows that man does have a choice of action there are enough examples of heroic nature that show that apathy can be overcome everything can be taken from a person but one thing the last and greatest of human freedoms to choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances
5184283 no one likes to be perceived or seen as being arrogant and i dont like that i dont like it and i admit its a problem for me

5184285 thats the way i approach things i try to answer everything truthfully i try to answer everything as directly as i possibly can i call things as i see them
5184286 some people see that as arrogance i admit that and it is a problem for us and it is something i have to work on
5184287 i actually could not believe that these domains were not taken last year so i bought them simply because they had not been taken

5184289 i have not decided what i am going to do with these domains

5184292 will in any case be reviewed because nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffers statement that russia used disproportionate force to protect its citizens that we acted beyond the limits of self defence is utterly intolerable
5184293 these are not credible allegations especially coming from the head of an organisation like nato which has itself used not just disproportionate force but force against civilian targets and the civilian population especially in its conflict with yugoslavia in 1999 mr rogozin added
5184294 clearly there has been recent debate about the jury system here in queensland arising out of a couple of cases

5184882 i immediately started apologizing oh excuse me mr sinatra excuse me but sinatra was cool about it he just said oh no problem it was my fault no problem his foot was actually sticking out from under the table and he had some nice what do call them wing tip shoes on so it probably didnt hurt
5184883 in addition most of the thoughts on luen as a player so far is that hes carried by rngrofl but at this point everyone is carried by someone so going with actual evidence of skill or lackthereof over speculation will hopefully give him a shot
5184884 i enjoyed reading destiny of the world and other stories because they seem populated by people we know and recognize
5184885 as the officers were in the lower apartment one of the detectives reviewed the search warrant application and realized it was for the upper apartment
5184886 my 12 year old and 6 year old dont want to be home at all
5184887 im always amused at how so many diggers turn a case of stupidity into part of a
5184888 if we get a call that there is a police officer coming into our trauma ward we immediately know well need a catheter from the pediatric ward
5184889 everybody is green we are blue because this represents the next stage blue skies blue oceans etc
5184890 will in any case be reviewed because nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffers statement that russia used disproportionate force to protect its citizens that we acted beyond the limits of self defence is utterly intolerable
5184891 these are not credible allegations especially coming from the head of an organisation like nato which has itself used not just disproportionate force but force against civilian targets and the civilian population especially in its conflict with yugoslavia in 1999 mr rogozin added
5184892 will in any case be reviewed because nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer amp squo s statement that russia used disproportionate force to protect its citizens that we acted beyond the limits of self defence is utterly intolerable
5184893 clearly there has been recent debate about the jury system here in queensland arising out of a couple of cases
5184894 while these amendments have not been designed with any particular case in mind they will apply to any case where an application is heard from the time that the amendments become law
5184895 i actually could not believe that these domains were not taken last year so i bought them simply because they had not been taken
5184896 i have been a web designer and webmaster for many years and i thought it very unusual to find that these names were available
5184897 i have not decided what i am going to do with these domains
5184898 i was unaware of him i hope hes a fan but i suspect maybe not
5184899 i hope he doesnt have any illegal or offensive intentions in mind im unaware of any reason to believe he does
5184900 no one likes to be perceived or seen as being arrogant and i dont like that i dont like it and i admit its a problem for me
5184901 if i get asked a question i normally give a straight answer and some people perceive that as arrogance
5184902 thats the way i approach things i try to answer everything truthfully i try to answer everything as directly as i possibly can i call things as i see them
5184903 some people see that as arrogance i admit that and it is a problem for us and it is something i have to work on

5184907 its not a hard period for me i still have friends in tottenham
5184908 im not angry about the decision of ramos to name me as a substitute against boro im not crying i only show my emotions to my close friends and family
5184909 but if i was laughing when i was on the bench people would say i was an idiot i noticed that eric cantona never smiled but i dont know if anyone ever asked him why he didnt look happier
5184910 we have two more weeks until the end of the transfer window i think this will be the most important week
5184911 we have a good squad and when tevez gets back and rooney gets games that will be my strike force
5184912 the last three years have been enormously consequential for telstra and australia with the full privatisation of telstra construction of the worlds largest fastest and most advanced wireless broadband network and the transformation of telstra into the worlds first nextgeneration fully integrated telco
5184913 working in a country and culture not your own is an enormous privilege and working for one of its iconic companies is a privilege amplified
5184914 my time in australia and with telstra has been one of the most memorable experiences of my life both personally and professionally
5184915 i came here expecting to stay for one to two months three years later mary sue and i leave having been welcomed guests in this wonderful country
5184916 it was hard for some to give up the idea that telstra is community property
5184917 the cultural change required by privatisation was difficult both for telstra and for the government
5184918 though we were criticised by some our new approach achieved important results including safeguarding new investments like nextg and adsl2 from value destroying regulation winding back regulation on more than four million copper telephone lines and the reversal of a 1 billion taxpayer gift to singtel optus
5184919 i have always valued phils advice and his principled approach to public policy and communications
5184920 phil has great integrity and has not been afraid to show leadership often speaking the truth even when it was inconvenient for established interests to hear it
5184921 ive tried to be honest while putting this list together rather than just cool you can be the judge of whether or not ive succeeded
5184922 she was the assistant or intern as you americans would have it she seemed pretty shocked she was a lovely french girl whose name escapes me isnt that dreadful i think her singing was perfect
5184923 the big miners were playing catch up from lower commodity prices over the weekend but weve seen oil tick up on a weakening us dollar and theres a potential storm brewing over the gulf of mexico mr mcdonald said
5184924 golds recovered to back over us800 an ounce and people are jockeying for position along with the bhp result which is coming out as we speak
5184925 the continuing massive industrialisation in china is providing solid support to the global economy
5184926 we have achieved another year of record earnings driven by excellent operating performance cost control and the delivery of high margin growth projects into strong market conditions
5184927 steven davis is set to become a rangers player tomorrow monday
5184928 a fee has been agreed with fulham for the midfielder who was on loan at ibrox last season and a deal has been agreed with the player in principle
5184929 we are studying the development of infrastructure at the heritage sites after the study we will submit a concept plan to the delhi government
5184930 end up catching a record execs attention for a childrens song written on a lark then find unlikely success as a wiggles type childrens band
5184931 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia
5184932 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5184933 kamarulzaman said he sent a protest letter to the culture arts and heritage ministry and the kuala lumpur mayor last week calling for the concert to be canceled
5184934 we started seeing a major spike in endorsements about june 1
5184935 it seems like the practical alternative both financially and for the environment
5184936 although web 2 0 is now entering the trough of disillusionment it will emerge within two years to have transformational impact as companies steadily gain more experience and success with both the technologies and the cultural implications
5184937 people who should know better are talking about a digital revolution about whether or not we will all be watching linear television in five years time
5184938 there is next to no demand for on demand the argument is wildly out of proportion about how important this is for television
5184939 following the trend of the last few years many of the new entries on this years hype cycle including microblogging social networking platforms and cloud computing are making their impact in the consumer world before they hit businesses
5184940 other technologies that have passed the trigger where they start to be interesting to businesses include 3 d printing surface computing augmented reality and mobile robots we expect early adopters to start applying these in novel ways and driving new classes of application such as using 3 d printers to dramatically change the supply chain by creating products and replacement parts at the point of need
5184941 the hype cycle should be used along with a planning model such as the priority matrix which highlights the technologies we believe are worth adopting early because of their potentially high impact
5184942 icelands civil union law includes all the same legal rights as does the traditional heterosexual marriage and there is only a question oftime until we see one unified marriage law for icelanders regardless of sex and sexual orientation
5184943 to make it clear what a progress we have seen i like to pointout that the revised versions ofsame sex registered partnershiplaw in 2000 and 2006 gave full adoptive rights to same sexcouples as well as full right to seek assistance in official fertility clinics
5184944 until the 1970s lesbians and gay men were practically invisible inicelandic society which surrounded them with contempt and massive silence
5184945 unfortunately we have not reached the same peak as norway what iceland has done is allowing for churches to marry if the priestwill agree norway has said everyone can get married deal with it
5184946 i see it as our most important task here to establish a parliamentarian committee to investigate the legal and social situation of transsexual people in iceland and suggest progressive improvements so important for their happiness and well being
5184947 although the situationis almost the best imaginable right now we must bear in mind that new generations appeare very year and therefore our fight for human rights as well as for the social security and well beingof gays and other queer people is a never ending story especially in terms of educational and informative work let us bear in mind that historically speaking we belong to a culture which has alwaysbeen hostile towards queers although being grateful for the enlightenment which characterises the modern iceland i am always prepared for some unexpected swing in weather
5184948 last year we saw some75 000 guests in the reykjav k city centre that makes about one fourth of the nation i would bequite happy to see some 100 000 this time
5184949 a great part of the people who attend reykjav k gay pride is heterosexual our families and friends and without this supportive atmosphere there would hardly be such a big celebration in reykjav k the general heterosexual support makes our festivities quite unique in the world and our queer visitors grasp this particular spirit immediately as they arrive
5184950 it takes engineering and engineers to create the pitch for other professions such as lawyers and accountants to play on
5184951 if they can buy commodities more intelligently than their competitors that can be an advantage
5184952 incredible faith that ea is going to pull this off
5184953 ea is a retail based company and that means theyre dealing with retailers everyday they have constant retail issues that theyre dealing with and the last thing in the world they want to do is announce that theyre going to go free to play thats not a good relationship builder with your retail sales teams
5184954 for them to actually make that announcement was huge i thought that was one of the biggest statements that ea has made in years and it just went over peoples heads
5184955 they already have invested in korea and the9 in china theyve been doing this for ages but theyve been keeping it down they built fifa online as a free mmo why would you make one of the most popular games in asia and not release it in the us
5184956 the reason they dont is because they werent going to commit ea to free to play games but finally they have i think battlefield heroes is going to be a huge hit its going to be a bit of a phenomenon i have incredible faith that ea is going to pull this off
5184957 its a whole different world you enter when you get into free to play its like the industry that weve all been missing and the second thing weve been missing is the idea of letting people pay what they want
5184958 ive made so many games and we never ever had the idea that people would pay more than the price of the game for the game no one would pay over usd 60 if its a usd 60 game on our 2moons game youve got people that spend usd 3000 happily and if we had more stuff for them to buy they would buy it
5184959 could you imagine if you were to take halo and offer it free to play how much money do you think some people would spend on halo if they had a huge array of items that they could buy i recon theres a cap out at about usd 10 000 when you think about it the most we ask for is usd 60 and when you get those people spending a lot of money it brings the average up on acclaim games right now we average usd 75 per person
5184960 its a tossup whether i check gamesindustry biz or make my morning coffee first as both are essential to my early morning routine i find gamesindustry biz a key component of my research with the sites editors and reporters breaking news stories more often than any of its competitors
5184961 in the sunset of dissolution everything is illuminated by the aura of nostalgia even the guillotine

5184968 who is to predict how things take place we have problems in the present to deal with trying to anticipate the future is a waste of time and energy right now
5184969 liu est obviamente muy apenado y yo puedo entender su dolor
5184970 dijo el fondista et ope se al ndose con el dedo la cabeza
5184971 esa carrera no se va a producir pero lo impredecible es una de las cosas buenas que tiene el deporte
5184972 phil had an important part in steering us in the right direction for achieving our class a mrp ii target
5184973 he made sure we didnt stray and kept us on track
5184974 i dont think we could have achieved class a without our consultant
5184975 what they bring to the party nowadays is their experience
5184976 theyre able to share the good ideas that we wouldnt otherwise be privy to
5184977 it is a great privilege and a tremendous pleasure for me to stand here before all the sterling winthrop people who made this day possible and say congratulations for a fantastic team effort and for earning the right to be known as a class a business
5184978 this plaque which i present to you today symbolizes the journey you have completed with distinction the mrp ii class a award i feel that you are as proud as me of your outstanding performance
5184979 it shows what can be achieved when the enormous potential of people working together is harnessed and directed to a common goal
5184980 congratulations sterling winthrop people and may your future be one of setting new standards in all that you do
5184981 over recent years we have begun to see this full potential being realized in all areas of our business
5184982 this latest achievement is definitely one of which we should all be very proud it reinforces our commitment to being the best in our business and highlights just what we can achieve by living our strategic framework our goals and our values
5184983 moreover when one considers that sterling winthrop is only the eighth organization out of more than 30 000 manufacturing operations in
5184984 it has been a problem for six or seven years
5184985 this is such a pity my guess is that it is the pressure from 1 3bn people which hurt him i dont think it has much to do with the injury for even if he was injured he would have had time to recover i think he might have psychological difficulties
5184986 but i dont think money is the big issue for him the question now is whether he is strong enough to make a comeback or not i am worried he might have a breakdown i believe he can overcome this but it might be difficult for him to be as successful as before
5184987 many people are very disappointed ordinary chinese people who have had their hopes fanned by too much propaganda
5184988 faced with this situation i can only say liu xiang quitting might be the best result at least he was not eliminated in the first round or at the final if this was so under the current propaganda situation in china who knows how hard he will be insulted actually the low state of liu xiangs sporting and health condition is an open secret but was ignored in the propaganda they made liu xiang out to be an indestructible flying man
5184989 we should understand him and try to put up with this he was really had injured and had to live under huge pressure
5184990 what have you been doing for the last four years if not trying to recover we have been expecting you to perform in 2008 but now we just watch you quit if you really want to dedicate yourself to the country you would crawl to the finish line but you always meant to lose
5184991 when you first get into the music business youre excited to be there you want to make records that everybodys loving
5184992 but after youve got years in the game you wanna give people the real side of you show people some character
5184993 life is good theres yachts theres nice cars theres movie roles
5184994 amy was in a right state slurring her words and falling all over the place
5184995 it was sad to see a young girl being left to babysit her it should be the other way around
5184996 i want to send my congratulations to team gb on this golden weekend for british sport eight gold medals and seventeen medals in total in one weekend is a superb and unprecedented achievement the whole country has been watching and has been thrilled by team gb we are immensely proud of what they have achieved so far and inspired by their performance our olympians talent and dedication represent the very best of britain and we look forward to another great week of british sporting success
5184997 the knower of truth should go about the world outwardly stupid like a child a madman or a devil
5184998 these records are the only surviving source of personnel information on members of the constabulary in ireland 1816 1922 although it gives only basic information it is often an invaluable tool given the lack of alternative genealogical sources
5184999 it was one of those nights when i wore a supertight dress that you couldnt have worn anything under since it would have showed
5185000 the paparazzi were literally lowering their cameras like speculums when i got out of the car
5185001 on the way home i said to my husband len wiseman darling i think they might have gotten it and so when we pulled in at home i made him re enact the thing with his camera a sort of crime scene run through
5185002 the people were great to have the tone and the voice and their perspective we just had everything from the extras to all the african talent they were amazing
5185003 we had extras on a street shoot out scene and they literally hit the pavement during the shoot out we had to stop because we thought people got hurt
5185004 i think leaders are very keen to see the commitments that were made last time adhered too
5185005 and i think there would be considerable concern if the person that gave those commitments wasnt prepared to come and explain himself
5185006 it was not new zealands intention to provide him with an excuse not to come
5185007 she saw me wearing them and she was like you know those are drews i dont care he broke them in and they fit me perfectly
5185008 sci fi is our umbrella brand for casual and online gaming in the uk and other countries outside the usa science fiction and fantasy fans have a huge affinity with gaming and our relationship with bigpoint will allow us to take advantage of growing popularity of multiple players
5185009 were pleased that were working with sci fi uk on our first collaboration following our agreement with nbc universal in june there is a perfect fit between our audiences and we look forward to extending this relationship with both sci fi and nbc universal in the future
5185010 whilst operators understandably dont want to be perceived as trying to unfairly glean excess revenues from unwitting subscribers while abroad taking a one size fits all approach blocking their usage while abroad will result in them losing very significant revenues at a time when you would expect them to be looking to maximise their 3g network investments
5185011 operators need to take better control of their network assets so that they can offer a bespoke service to each user on a case by case basis
5185012 in a competitive european market where operators are increasingly trying to differentiate their service and the many millions of corporate subscribers are becoming increasingly international operators surely have no choice but to ensure they maximise all mobile broadband revenue opportunities whilst offering subscribers the best possible service
5185013 this is surely an indictment on customer data standards at any organisation that sends transactional documents all of whom want to grasp the transpromo opportunity but a section of whom seem to be undermining that opportunity
5185014 if transpromo is to be effectively exploited there needs to be an improvement in customer data standards two fifths of the population have received bills or statements addressed to the wrong person in the last six months which could seriously undermine consumer attitudes to advertising carried in those documents the opportunities presented by transpromo are probably very considerable but their effective use requires british business to make significant enhancements to the way it manages and updates customer records
5185015 we believe the ncaa has treated ben differently than it has other athletes with very very similar circumstances
5185016 the survey paints a stark picture of the challenging business environment that has emerged in the uk over the past year with the economy facing its most difficult period since the early 1990s this is now compounded by high and uncertain oil and commodity prices creating inflationary pressures and fall out from the uk housing market downturn which has continued to gather pace at the same time we are seeing a new realism among businesses about the need to weather the current economic conditions with projected staff and capital investment both significantly down on this time last year
5185017 as an increased number of businesses express concern over late payment effective cash flow management is now more essential than ever for those sectors with rising input costs such as manufacturing and transport amp storage
5185018 we expect the slowdown to be at its worst towards the end of 2008 and into early 2009 we also expect inflation to start falling back from early 2009 allowing the bank of england room to cut interest rates throughout 2009 nevertheless overall the performance of uk plc through 2009 is likely to be the weakest growth since 1992 when the economy grew by just 0 3 per cent however towards the end of 2009 providing wage inflation stays low economic activity looks likely to pick up

5185033 aunque soy muy malo en eso no puedes ser bueno en todo
5185034 it is pretty frustrating i want to hopefully get a job but cant because have to find out if i need surgery or not
5185035 the virus is really tough its hard to disinfect against it and theres no vaccines so when you get an outbreak you have to work hard to clear it out
5185036 but there is a risk of that because the doctors and some of the nurses work in both facilities so were putting in some primary prevention hand washing and so on
5185037 lo primero que hemos hecho ha sido dar la enhorabuena al equipo dan s por ser los nuevos campeones ol mpico es lo que ten amos que hacer con el ganador en cuanto a nosotros tenemos que estar contentos pues vinimos a por una medalla y tenemos la plata que para nosotros es un s per xito

5185046 you walk out on that stage and its ohmygosh im on a broadway stage ohmygosh im going to perform a lead role in a broadway show ohmygosh im playing a woman
5185047 it was interesting to realize that doing it here in sacramento is really no different than doing it in new york except for the geography and maybe more money is put into the production in new york you have to rehearse you put a costume on and theres an audience its just another show in another theater
5185048 i dont know if this will be the last time i play her
5185049 it may be but it would be nice to be a guy a biker guy who kills somebody on stage
5185050 i think everybody has an aunt or mother or neighbor that is like edna shes just a workin woman who kinda tells it like it is she had a dream and then realized she couldnt pursue it because she had to take care of her family shes in love with her husband whos kind of a crackpot but thats what she loves about him the store he runs doesnt bring in enough money so she takes in laundry its the 60s when it was the womans job to take care of home and hearth
5185051 the show is written so well that as an actor its fun to play her the worse you look her back hurts shes on her 9 millionth load of laundry shes trying to protect her daughter the more you can let that come out at the end she becomes the glamour queen of the entire show
5185052 its nice when a big kid gets to wear a fat suit
5185053 yep ya gotta pad even me up to be a woman
5185054 i thought that filmmaking was the way to make a living but i had to do what i felt compelled to do quit film school and write my book and worry about the making a living part later
5185055 surprisingly easy since we approach fiction in the same way as character driven we work closely and edit each others work in progress
5185056 were great at bouncing ideas back and forth were each others sounding board
5185057 people come up to me and say i didnt know about you until a friend gave me one of your books and now im reading them all
5185058 and they say to me i read your wifes books and ive decided to read yours we get new readers off of each other
5185059 ive always thought of the series as an ongoing biography of a man who happens to be a detective
5185060 nameless is tough when he has to be but hes actually soft hearted
5185061 theyre very visual magazines with great cover art lurid is the word but dont forget that a lot of very important writers got their starts there
5185062 i collect beaded purses and ive got the first edition steinbecks and mcmurtrys i wanted
5185063 terry definitely needs to come to all of these races with us
5185064 but its always been a dream to run a funny car
5185065 we definitely needed these points after running such a perfect weekend
5185066 i cant say enough good stuff about these people out here
5185067 we generally run pretty well at high altitude tracks like this
5185068 but we by no means thought we had it in the bag we felt we a good chance to win though
5185069 i went from a 13 second car to a 6 second car and then we decided to build this now here we are
5185070 i have no desire to move to a different class anytime soon
5185071 if anybody cant understand the fact that we are risking someones career playing on that field than that person should not be associated with the game period
5185072 at first glance actually its a little worse than it was saturday
5185073 for some reason or another it seems like the water is coming out from the ground up it seems like some of the spots that were dry saturday are kind of wet sunday so i dont know what to make of it
5185074 everybody wanted to play saturday we are in player development our job is to get these guys in the situations to play but sometimes you just cant do it things are out of your control and make it impossible for you to go out there and perform
5185075 its been a lifelong dream of mine to wrestle in the olympics
5185076 we have been in serious training if this opportunity became available
5185077 we are excited for him and have confidence in his ability to perform well at the olympic games
5185078 we have more money coming in but more money going out
5185079 the biggest frustration on the street is when joe blow says boy you guys are making a lot of money this year he doesnt understand that the cost of fuel and everything else is going up
5185080 oh boy im getting ready to order red diesel and i dont know how much it will be thats scary
5185081 i do both at once to save me a trip across the fields
5185082 they can make so much more in the energy field
5185083 what it does is it increases our risk instead of for example having 500 an acre into a crop we might have 800 or 900 into a crop it increases the risk if we have a crop failure
5185084 if its a good crop it compensates if we have a crop failure it increases our crop exposure
5185085 sugar beets have easily over a 1 000 per acre input
5185086 of all the crops we grow nothing uses more fuel or fertilizer than what sugar beets do
5185087 just about every farmer i know is just growing what hes required to grow
5185088 but this year under this scenario its probably one of the least profitable
5185089 if its a choice of this plan or none obviously we trappers will support this plan
5185090 the value of this animal alive is far greater than the value of this animal to a trapper
5185091 i dont know of anybody who makes a living catching fur
5185092 we see any reduction of our opportunity as kind of the camels nose under the tent
5185093 only in cases where its harming rare wildlife or where its not done in a responsible and sustainable way
5185094 continuing conversation and number crunching and consideration of the research
5185095 there was more thinking more deliberation more input from members of the public more best adaptation of the current science to absolutely minimize the risk to the wolverine population
5185096 depends in part on whether the public feels comfortable with it and whether the wolverine can survive the continuing human development that fragments its ranges
5185097 i think its an indication that we as a city have probably a more active lifestyle and maybe a little healthier eating we certainly have some of the best restaurants in the country
5185098 i just dont think weve got that information for missoula though i think its probably true that we are thinner than many places and the state as a whole is probably too
5185099 where you choose to live in the second half of your life can make all the difference so exactly what makes a city healthy
5185100 if you live near a hiking and biking trail and all your neighbors use it youll probably use it too if a farmers market is just down the street youre likely to eat more fruits and vegetables if your city has multiple hospitals theres a good chance youll get superior medical care
5185101 we do a lot of things within our city budgets each year that are designed to help people be healthy and really enjoy the place
5185102 we feel safe here we can go out and take a walk
5185103 even at the retirement homes in the communities there are places where people can go out and take walks i think were doing a good job with that
5185104 i could think of four or five places that i felt would be safe even with 5 30 traffic
5185105 the good news about any of these lists is were getting more and more cognizant that those are factors that are appealing
5185106 how do we consciously build them and contend with zoning and subdivision requirements and the way that private property has been handled that keeps us from having the kinds of places that more and more people are having
5185107 if youve done an interview let me tell you youll remember it
5185108 i heard somebody say that most of the players in the nba would be considered overweight
5185109 he didnt tolerate anything but total devotion to the craft
5185110 no one had ever done that before to the great dr debakey
5185111 i probably wouldnt have been in medicine if i hadnt been hitchhiking one day
5185112 we went downtown for a cup of coffee and within five minutes the banker and clerk of court and a county commissioner all sitting in a booth together told me that they were really desperate for a physician
5185113 and if you came back for a follow up on the same problem it was 3
5185114 of course we didnt have all the paperwork to slow us down
5185115 when i resuscitated her i wondered if i was resuscitating a vegetable that would end up in warm springs
5185116 i didnt have the speed but they a team in the north park league said they needed a pitcher
5185117 in my lifetime its gone from grass huts to skyscrapers
5185118 every doctor probably thinks his was the best era to be a doctor
5185119 when i got out of training i thought theres nothing left to learn and ive learned more than that since then
5185120 its like giving the keys to the chicken coop to the fox
5185121 weve always said we wont allow a two tiered system in this country
5185122 just as soon as im done ill be writing an epilogue
5185123 but rather than wallow in lifes imponderables cherry and her husband remain optimistic because love is unconditional
5185124 having expectations can cut both ways expectations can motivate you towards a goal but it can also exacerbate disappointment when u fail to meet them
5185125 i was speaking to a couple of players yesterday theres a lot of uncertainty and there always seems to be these big decisions to be made gilchrist said today
5185126 it is an important time for cricket everyone has identified that players and administrators
5185127 wait and see attitude and were expecting to be briefed by the icc over the next few days
5185128 no consideration of an alternative venue at this stage and were today still awaiting further feedback from the icc
5185129 the important issue now is for us to work with the icc we are not in the business of going to players and asking their answers prior to us making a decision brown said
5185130 i work very closely with paul marsh the australian cricketers association chief executive and individual players from time to time but we are not deliberately interfering with the players preparation at the moment until we have got something to tell them
5185131 our view is quite simply we need now to see where the icc choose to go with this im sure they will come back to us in the next few days as always we are working with all of our parties and that decision will play itself out in due course
5185132 the icc are the ones who are in control of both the detail and the possible alternative venue so im sure we all understand that its their position now brown said
5185133 we are delighted with the popularity of fishtext and feedback so far indicates that users are extremely pleased with the service
5185134 fishtexts success demonstrates that traditional text messaging is an overpriced and underdeveloped service many users have expressed surprise that the fishtext mobile application delivers text messages all over the world so reliably for just a couple of pence while their own operator charges over ten times that amount with some not even providing delivery reports or charging extra for them
5185135 iphone and nokia owners who regularly call north america can purchase truphones bundle to get peace of mind pricing of just 1 5 us cents 0 75 pence per minute to the usa and canada from anywhere in the world people dont want to calculate precise per minute rates or check tariff websites or take a paid for tariff bolt on to get a still high rate they simply want to feel comfortable about what theyre going to pay for the call they want to make

5185141 with over 40 years experience in information security and having worked closely with the information security forum it is clear that its role is more important than ever
5185142 information security is no longer just a technical challenge it is a business imperative and is or should be on the top of boardroom agendas in every corporation the isf is a unique organization that provides a confidential peer to peer forum for members across different countries sectors and disciplines and is able to draw on their diverse skills and expertise to distill best practice and deliver an unmatched portfolio of research methodologies and tools
5185143 it is a distinct privilege to be the first president of the isf and i look forward to working with the dedicated professionals that have brought the isf to the position it is today i will strive to help raise greater awareness of the information security challenges faced today from the increase in cybercrime to the growing burden of compliance companies need to adopt a risk management perspective and recognize that information security is business driven and not crisis driven
5185144 we are delighted that howard schmidt has accepted this important position at the isf
5185145 the value of the isf has always been born out of the people in the organization its members our expert consultants and the management team it is clear that howards unparalleled experience and knowledge will make a major contribution to the future of the isf and its members he will also be driving our ambitious plans to expand the scale and reach of the isf building on our existing membership from europe and scandinavia through the americas to the middle east india africa australia and the pacific rim

5185148 a great opportunity to see what is happening what is on the future time path and great interaction with all of the professionals around the world
5185149 our results show that almost half of people questioned felt they had bought their endowment policy on a false promise this is not just a case of a small purchase this is thousands of pounds for a house that we are talking about
5185150 there are several reasons that somebody may have been mis sold an endowment policy including a lack of adequate explanation an endowment policy is not a short term commitment and this should have been made clear when the policy was bought as should the fees and risks involved
5185151 without this information people were unable to make an informed decision and should be able to claim some compensation depending on the circumstances
5185152 a lot of times the differences are very apparent but they still have a lot of common
5185153 theyre not afraid to tell you if youre a dork
5185154 you have to step up and stand up for that person
5185155 its important that people realise that not having a degree isnt the end of the world
5185156 there are lots of options for young people to build a successful career in their industry of choice however if youre young and starting to make money its a good idea to start thinking about saving for the future nobodys young forever
5185157 many 16 21 year olds now make the choice to go straight to work rather than university and as a result are very career driven we think it is important to recognise those who are just starting out in their working life and offer them support especially in the first stages of their professional lives when they are likely to be making important financial decisions
5185158 with this in mind the premier 21 account has been launched to allow this group to maximise the potential of their hard earned cash the account offers a 10 interest rate the highest credit interest rate on the high street to help make their money go further
5185159 we had a good spectrum of the local running community
5185160 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5185161 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5185162 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5185163 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5185164 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5185165 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5185166 it was a suicide car bombing against the gates of the salerno camp
5185167 moments later a second car bomber came and wanted to detonate his bombs police identified him and opened fire on him
5185168 these reports indicate that the enemies of the people of afghanistan intend to attack civilian military and government targets during afghan independence celebrations
5185169 prefiero q vos seas enamorado de mi hermana a que otro pelotudoo este con ella pero eso si si vos le haces algo te la veras conmigo
5185170 me ahorro el psicologo x q junto mi money para una mu eca system
5185171 theres a lot of uncertainty and there always seems to be these big decisions to be made
5185172 it is an important time for cricket everyone has identified that players and administrators but as was the case throughout my career you just take the advice of the experts in the security field and thats what cricket australia and the players association are continuing to do and the players would trust that opinion i have no doubt about that
5185173 our view is quite simply we need now to see where the icc choose to go with this
5185174 im sure they will come back to us in the next few days the icc are the ones who are in control of both the detail and the possible alternative venue so im sure we all understand that its their position now
5185175 the important issue now is for us to work with the icc
5185176 we are not in the business of going to players and asking their answers prior to us making a decision
5185177 demand pl around the same time major customers within the region started demanding better customer service levels introducing heavy penalties for stopping the plant or running out of stock on the shelves
5185178 demand pl so what should you look for if you are about to hire a demand pl education is a key in developing an effective demand pl anne r and apics demand management and forecasting courses are consistently booked out
5185179 it is my opinion that the november election is not the correct election for the school district to place these issues
5185180 these issues need to be clearly explained and detailed for the voters and i do not believe that it will be possible to do a thorough job of this in the short busy time period available
5185181 approximately 40 percent of the voters will be voting early through the absentee voting process and will have voted by the first week of october leaving you with only 30 or so school days to reach your voters
5185182 once the presidential congressional gubernatorial executive and local candidates begin their media blitzes there is such an overload of information that any of the more local issues are usually buried under this blizzard
5185183 this additional verbiage is going to increase the voters ballot fatigue and i believe we will see a marked decrease in the votes cast on the back of the ballot or on a second page
5185184 new and interesting species are still being discovered on caribbean islands despite the very small amount of natural forests remaining
5185185 even the middle of the road songs on this record showcase oberst in a new way

5185190 were investigating to see whether the marina or other surrounding businesses might have surveillance video that could give us some leads
5185191 unless the person came in from the water on a boat
5185192 there was no light no exit just a hole there was no way to get out
5185193 if i got out i was just thinking ive got to do something im 34 and have really been doing nothing
5185194 i was praying to god saying ill go to church try to get better employment try not to cause my mom grief
5185195 i said its fine son dont worry about it as long as youre ok
5185196 its really amazing he actually didnt die and doesnt have any broken bones
5185197 we contend with illegal people sometimes camping up there we try to scare them out
5185198 they definitely go through my dads property and bother the dogs
5185199 i just mad dogged down to the cave to go check it out
5185200 fortunately for him the bottom of that shaft has water in it
5185201 i wanted to be home watching tv and i wanted my mom more than anything but my mom and dad didnt know i was up there the only clue i left was we have a chain across the path and id left my keys in the lock and the chain was lowered
5185202 when i was in pain screaming and bawling and flipping out about 1 30 in the afternoon i heard my friend donny nute saying im here to save you im going to get a rope
5185203 we lowered a guy down who was able to talk to him and lower down a helmet and some dry clothes but we didnt have the expertise to get him out
5185204 they left for five hours and i quite honestly had an insane moment that id hallucinated their arrival and figured id die by drowning because i thought the water was rising
5185205 all the rescuers said he could easily have been killed hes very lucky and young enough to withstand the fall
5185206 they look welcoming and like they might be exciting but there are so many dangers
5185207 there are supposed be sealed gates but somebody had cut the lock off
5185208 there are thousands of mines in the sierra and hundreds in that area many of those were trying to plug up and reduce access to so people cant get in there
5185209 we periodically check but we dont know if and when this was vandalized we need the public to tell us
5185210 the driver of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to a pedestrian crossing the roadway within any marked crosswalk or within any unmarked crosswalk at an intersection but this section does not relieve a pedestrian from the duty of using due care for his or her safety
5185211 just out of curiosity and i dont mean any disrespect
5185212 and i cant approach a perfect stranger this was a great way for me to find out more
5185213 we want to show that we are part of this community and what better way to show that than coming to the state fair which gets people of all different backgrounds
5185214 all they want to do is spread a little knowledge
5185215 sacramento is a diverse area we have a lot of cultures here and people are used to that
5185216 im quitting i closed my store in june so make me an offer
5185217 i liked to make stuff and collect stuff but i had no retail experience
5185218 i called my mother in texas to confer with her shed always wanted to have a store she said to go for it so without quite knowing how to do it in january of 2000 i opened bower bird
5185219 my motto for the store nothing you need but everything you cant live without
5185220 i remember when i first opened i thought i hope somebody comes
5185221 the very first year i showed a tiny profit the next year there was major construction next door and business suffered after that business kept growing every year the store was packed with merchandise i hired two or three college girls to help we were open seven days a week and i was able to support myself
5185222 at bower bird kids dogs and food were always welcome
5185223 id tell them youre a man in a chick store you need help
5185224 it was perfect and it filled an important niche in davis
5185225 after july and august i got nervous by october of 2006 i canceled 15 000 worth of holiday orders
5185226 in september a year ago i let go my last college girl and i closed the store two days a week i havent had health benefits since december
5185227 toward the end i was averaging 3 000 a month in sales down from 20 000 a month in non holiday periods
5185228 but they were still hitting me up people who never thought to buy a card or dish themselves
5185229 we had a farewell party all day i cried my customers cried
5185230 those small unique business are often fragile with very small profit margins
5185231 even in good times those business owners are brave folks
5185232 but not a huge number of them its not to the point that its resulting in downtown blight
5185233 still at a time when the worlds crazy we do need a feeling of connection and community
5185234 im not a cancer researcher or a heart surgeon but i do think i contributed something to davis my store was like a little heart downtown
5185235 i cranked it over and saw that i had absolutely no fuel
5185236 i know i had at least 40 gallons left in it
5185237 i dont intend to put a locking cap on it because theyll just poke a hole in my truck if they poke a hole in the tank that would cost 1 000 then id get mad
5185238 we havent seen anything abnormal but that doesnt mean there havent been more or if we had one or two more last night said lt jeff ausnow the placer county sheriffs spokesman
5185239 thats not to say its not happening it could just be reported as petty theft
5185240 its been quite a problem for us weve been getting hit quite a lot
5185241 the homes have been unoccupied for about two and a half years
5185242 a private owner was going to take control of the properties demolish the old buildings and build new housing
5185243 theres something about rocklin that is special but its also underperforming in regards to where it needs to be
5185244 ive always believed we could do better as a city in planning economic development traffic control and the management of future growth
5185245 im curious whats going on over there and whos doing what
5185246 i have nothing bad to say about anybody i just think i have good ideas for the city too
5185247 investigators from the california highway patrol and our agency met for a long time friday afternoon to discuss it
5185248 if certain forms of free radicals are actually persistent that increases chances they may interact with biological cells to create damage
5185249 there will always be some particles present in air regardless of where youre at
5185250 there are many instances where if we have a bad air quality day that concentration in air could be similar to a home where smoking is taking place
5185251 i suck at golf but youre bald so i guess i win
5185252 i think it should be based on sound science and if something gets listed there should be a recovery plan in place immediately with a kind of a level of when do you know the tank is full and then once that happens then whatever that species is comes off the list
5185253 i just want to make sure that humans dont become the endangered species

5185256 i am optimistic about the bilateral talk with the thai side to seek peaceful resolution to withdraw the troops totally from the keo sikha kiri svara pagoda and the surrounding areas of the preah vihear temple in the eponymous cambodian province

5185258 we will discuss step by step to withdraw the troops there and end the problem in the near future

5185292 there were not that many problems for me to adapt to playing in england
5185293 when i first met the boss he said that maybe i would need a bit of time maybe up to six months but actually i felt really good straight away
5185294 i have a personal programme with the physio to get stronger because everyone has told me english football is different with more contact
5185295 it is just to be stronger and to be able to cope with the 50 50s with the intensity of english football
5185296 i am working hard in training and felt really good out on the pitch
5185297 it is of course flattering but also a bit annoying as well because that is a lot of pressure
5185298 it is hard to be compared to such a player the best of the past 10 years in european football
5185299 when you are a young player you tend to be a bit irregular and not play so well every week

5185304 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5185305 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5185306 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5185349 we have placed senator mccain in a cone of silence
5185350 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological position or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5185351 as president i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5185352 i think barack obama is very likeable and emotional but he skirted the issues the evening definitely cemented my views
5185353 barack obama was just like a regular politician he didnt answer the questions
5185354 if it exists should we negotiate with it contain it or defeat it
5185355 defeat it if i am president of the united states my friends i will follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell and i will get him

5185364 all we can do now is go back and see how it all plays out
5185365 well come out tuesday and compete and play the way team canada is supposed to play
5185366 whatever you need to do to get more opportunities to score is what we need
5185367 its very tough youre kind of just trying to finish it out trying to get a couple guys on stay within yourself
5185368 but easier said than done without that atmosphere without that little extra edge but thats part of being a professional baseball player trying to maintain and do that through the good and the bad times
5185369 he was really good his last outing just one of those days those guys sometimes looked in the right spot sometimes looked at the right pitch and got just the good enough one to hit at the right times it was one of those days josh hasnt had one of those days
5185370 is this going to ruin josh for the year no
5185371 guys start playing games they start guessing and then theyre guessing right
5185372 or they dont and you misfire you make the wrong pitch when a lot of success has gone on offensively it allows you to play the game a little be patient be smart do those things we made some mistakes and we made some good pitches and they did some good hitting
5185373 its going to be a big test especially with the road record weve got to find a way to win games that arent here at fenway you have to do that you cant just keeping winning games at home youve got to find a way to win them on the road
5185374 the fabric of our church community has been torn to help us acknowledge this we organized a rending of the garment ritual which was borrowed from the jewish tradition
5185375 the shirt will be usable again but it will never be the same as it was before
5185376 just as our community will never be the same as we were before
5185377 to make visible the inward hurt we feel at having been attacked as well as the pain we feel at having lost linda
5185378 i couldnt have thought of a better way to begin the healing process
5185379 the worship committee meeting was the first regularly scheduled meeting after the shooting
5185380 i told them that this was not normal time and that we couldnt continue as if this were normal time i said that they could be creative in what they did to recognize that
5185381 its a graphic and violent act to tear the fabric of a shirt
5185382 but with the mending of the shirt theres a corresponding promise that there will be healing
5185383 near the hill where he was crucified there was a garden
5185384 see if you can find us two houses in the same neighborhood the closer the better because were going to be working so closely together
5185385 we have the perfect solution a two in one house on one level is an entire house with a kitchen and then on another level the same thing
5185386 today is an absolutely incredible day and were going to stay in the moment
5185387 for me its not about reconciling the past its about winning
5185388 i knew we had won it and that nobody was coming back at that point i kept telling them to keep on cranking because i had my arms in the air and i didnt want them to stop the emotion was really starting to hit
5185389 if a coach couldnt win with these guys he shouldnt be coaching
5185390 these sanctuaries of unspoiled nature represent places of spiritual renewal where we can return to the source of our being
5185391 a temple far finer than any made by human hands
5185392 provide us with some of the most beautiful majestic and awe inspiring places on earth
5185393 this denomination this community has held up the banner for human rights and for justice through a very difficult period in this countrys history
5185394 and as we begin to move forward now its a result of your resolve your persistence that we stand on the threshold of a new era in american politics you will make the difference between success and failure for this new president this transition to a clean green economy our exit from this horrible war
5185395 a little bit mo just a little bit just a little bit mo little mo little bit mo petroleum
5185396 it was shameful am i wrong did you see the speech he was like a crackhead trying to lick the crack pipe for a fix
5185397 cut demand and diversify the supply inside those few words is the key to a new america
5185398 we cannot drill and burn our way out of our energy problems out of our economic problems if we do so we will bake the planet but working together we can invent and invest our way out
5185399 even when we are right nuclear proliferation whether at the behest of north korea iran or a mad scientist in pakistan is truly a terrifying problem nobody believes us and even when moral leadership is desperately needed as in darfur nobody trusts us enough to follow
5185400 most americans have no idea how much that has damaged the u s reputation around the world
5185401 the only way to engage the saudis iranians and iraqis in stabilizing iraq is for the united states in one fashion or another to eat a portion of humble pie
5185402 we need to continue to promote democracy around the world but not at the point of a gun we need to continue to use those guns but on behalf of those who are truly most vulnerable as we learned in rwanda and kosovo and now darfur the stupidity and tragedy of iraq will only be compounded if we use it in the future as an excuse to let hundreds of thousands of people die
5185403 its going to take leaders who know where their hearts have been broken and know how to help the rest of us turn our passion into compassion and our anger into a transforming fire we need conscious progressive open minded broken hearted people who will stand up and help reimagine what will come next its a calling for us you and i can and must help make america america again the country it has never been but yet can be
5185404 i draw from it all year in my sermons and small group ministry
5185405 he moves me because he is so emblematic of what we ought to be
5185406 the one thing that cant be taken from us even by death is the love we give away before we go each day that i am sick i pray for the sun to come up for people to love me for manageable tasks that i can still accomplish for a little extra courage for reality to blow all the detritus off my plate so i can pay attention to what really matters we cannot embrace our life fully until we find a way to accept our death to be free to accept death is to be free period
5185407 im going to get better at guessing how long you would like to not talk about things
5185408 i fear this resolution will be asking this delegate body to make promises that many congregations cannot keep
5185409 unitarian universalists strive to create examples of what caring community might look like a community that is engaged with civic life with the world and which does not flinch from its responsibilities does not deny its role as a beacon of hope and a center of service to the folks in their community every part of our tradition every source of our knowing calls us to service in the world it isnt just that you and i need unitarian universalist congregations the world needs unitarian universalist congregations

5185425 we remain bitterly disappointed at the manner in which sonny bill deserted his team mates and his supporters
5185426 we have however reached the point where we need to get on with business and we have withdrawn the injunction against him playing for any other club
5185427 neither the bulldogs nor sonny bill have anything further to gain by drawing this situation out any further
5185428 with this matter resolved we now look to finishing off our final few games of the season as strongly as possible and delivering steve folkes the farewell he deserves
5185429 the coalition forces invaded afghanistan and we know that women are very important to the forces that invaded afghanistan
5185430 our women and common people are important to us too about one month ago the coalition forces attacked a wedding in jalalabad that killed 49 people women children men boys everyone that was present
5185431 to take revenge on the coalition forces and foreign people and to show the world that our people are just as important as yours
5185432 traditionally badal or revenge has been one of the mainstays of the pashtunwali code or the way of the pashtun
5185433 so its not at all surprising to me that the taliban would use revenge as justification for the killing of the aid workers
5185434 afghanistan has to try to have good relations with you but if your government continues a reversed policy the afghans will be obliged to kill your nationals in revenge for their brothers their sisters and their children
5185435 events such as logar will happen again because occupied afghanistan looks at all actors that are established in the interest of america with an eye of hostility
5185436 this letter is a disgusting attempt to justify the deliberate killings of innocent civilians there is no justification for these killings by the taliban
5185437 canada is in afghanistan at the request of the democratically elected government of that country canadians are part of a un sanctioned nato led coalition that is attempting to bring stability and security to the people of afghanistan we will continue to fight for these goals we will continue to protect the afghan people from these ruthless killers
5185438 the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5185439 they have to know that the canadian forces under american command handicap tens among the afghan people every day to this kind of condolence and they kill in addition to men numbers of women and children as well
5185440 rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghans to please the fascist regime of america your government did not take into account the national interests of canada and did not follow a neutral policy it sacrificed its national and international respect and standing in service of the interests of america
5185441 this is not a problem for us because this man is the same slave of the foreigners

5185449 the president will address the nation at 1 00 pm 0700 gmt
5185450 the president is determined to defend himself he will fight on he has given no indication that he will accept the charges against him
5185451 there is a strong possibility that he might announce his resignation but there is equally a chance that he might commit a blunder
5185452 our stance is still the same that those who violated the constitution should not be given safe passage or indemnity of his actions
5185453 he is a wise man he is a very experienced
5185454 his political fate has been sealed whatever he says doesnt matter
5185455 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5185456 the point is the party is united were coming together
5185457 we are now entering one of the most intense political periods that we have ever seen
5185458 we are jamming in a lot of major events the selection of each candidates vice president their national conventions the debates and election day all in an almost 10 week period
5185459 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5185460 if anybody had asked us a couple of months ago whether or not we would like to be where we are today which from what we can tell is a pretty even race we would have been pretty thrilled
5185461 there were large gaps today between teammate petter solberg in front of us and henning solberg behind us so we werent taking any silly risks
5185462 its not been a bad weekend and there are a lot of things we can take forward from it
5185463 this morning was a little frustrating but we tried to find out some new things today that will help us continue fine tuning the car and improve our performance which is the main focus
5185464 im really looking forward to new zealand in a couple of weeks now
5185465 its like my home rally i have a good feeling for the roads there and hopefully we can keep taking steps forward with the car on dirt
5185466 i would hope that this initiative can bring an end to the conflict that we have had for several years the discussions indicate that that is going to happen
5185467 within the discussions we have made it quite clear to the amaury group that we respect their organizational rights in their events and we ask that they respect the uci in its authority according to its statutes

5185472 we look at his experience and look at how he does in practice and know hes physically able to make plays and are betting on his experience to not make bad plays
5185473 we know what to expect to see thats why we have him
5185474 by gosh you had better play well against the broncos or else
5185475 you know what some of the penalty calls they made too will make some things happen too
5185476 yes the one where they jumped off sides and were in the neutral zone im standing on the line so im sitting here looking at it and andre gurode is not going to snap it unless they are in the neutral zone
5185477 i think mr hochuli likes to get himself on tv a little bit i know he likes to work out but cmon mr hochuli
5185478 it was the only way to get both guys in the lineup
5185479 were committed to chris as a big part of our club going forward if he shows he can play at third base that gives us an option its hard to imagine a 2009 team without him in it at one spot or the other
5185480 hes 27 years old and im not going to rule it out long term for him
5185481 chris told us he feels more confident over there in the physical shape hes now in
5185482 you need a very serious consumer advocate with our rapid growth we are going to see upward pressure to raise rates on utilities
5185483 coal is up to 90 a ton natural gas and oil costs are rising i believe renewable energy is the future and arizona could become the solar power
5185484 the company must make a profit but at what price to the consumer can a company make up for bad management
5185485 i was proud of that vote then and i am today
5185486 im an advocate for renewables if demand is not satisfied by renewables of course as a commissioner i have a responsibility to consider nuclear and other sources
5185487 we wouldnt have the investment we do in solar etc if it hadnt been put in place
5185488 cost is a factor but as we use renewables increasingly the cost will come down the acc has taken a lead on this issue
5185489 i dont want to be a tool for the utilities
5185490 were totally addicted to fossil fuels we need to develop alternative fuels
5185491 ive never seen such volatility in the market in energy it makes perfect sense to switch to clean economic energy not only for the environment but also for the economy
5185492 i think hes nice and i think hes sincere in what he says
5185493 im probably the only person in this town that does
5185494 mccain will have problems getting a high turnout among those voters unless he finds some way to identify with them some way to make them think that a hes not connected to bush and b his economic plan is superior to obamas
5185495 john mccain continues to hear the concerns of rural families thats why he has made every effort to engage these voters on his plans to create jobs and provide relief for working families
5185496 were getting a great response in rural communities that have been ignored by washington and left behind in the bush economy
5185497 the big miners were playing catch up from lower commodity prices over the weekend but weve seen oil tick up on a weakening us dollar and theres a potential storm brewing over the gulf of mexico mr mcdonald said
5185498 golds recovered to back over us800 an ounce and people are jockeying for position along with the bhp result which is coming out as we speak
5185499 were going in and were going to take care of this for these guys
5185500 when i wake up in the morning i have crud in my eyes and i have like this slimy phlegm in the back of my throat

5185506 this type of attack will form at least a part of all geopolitical conflicts from now on
5185507 you volunteered to weaponize your pc and participate in a denial of service attack
5185508 interfere with critical services in a way that gives a military advantage
5185509 i dont understand the rules but its exciting to see an olympic event
5185510 there is plenty else to report the logistics are running smoothly the venues are jaw dropping and the chinese team is delivering big time
5185511 this is a games for the local audience and they are having as much fun as you could expect they wont look at it with the same critical eye as a bunch of foreigners
5185512 really achieved the major objective presenting themselves to their country as presenting themselves to the world without actually doing so
5185513 i have not been allowed to visit her and i worry she will not be released after the month is over
5185514 i did say that the olympic games coming to china will help china to open up further and to reform better the fact is after 30 years of reform china has developed greatly
5185515 people enjoy more freedom everybody can see that olympic games is a great platform
5185516 bee is a really terrific candidate for the republicans i dont think they could have gotten a better candidate
5185517 if he had run against giffords last time when the seat was open he might have beaten her
5185518 within the time that the republican brand name nationwide and within arizona is in peril
5185519 youve got to assume at this point in time that giffords is the front runner and has the advantage of incumbency
5185520 we have a very strong organization ive got some of the top leaders and campaign volunteer organizations in the state
5185521 were feeling very good about our position at this time
5185522 we will be seeing the republican national party putting in more
5185523 i take the fact that hes bringing in washington heavyweights to campaign for him as a sign of republicans objective to take this seat away
5185524 as long as the grotto stands key west will never again experience the full brunt of a hurricane
5185525 people are playing in their head considering what happened the last time
5185526 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5185527 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5185528 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5185529 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5185530 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5185531 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5185532 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5185533 if i would ask you how fast the american forces can leave iraq the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5185534 the same answer would be toward this situation as soon as we are assured that georgians will not continue to use military force against south ossetians and against abkhazians

5185539 from tomorrow russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5185540 russia wont leave georgia for weeks and it will never withdraw from abkhazia and south ossetia
5185541 they will create every kind of diplomatic language to stay there
5185542 there is no such notion any more in georgia as russian peacekeepers there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces
5185543 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5185544 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5185545 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5185546 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5185547 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5185548 we are waiting for more support from other countries because this is not a war between russian and georgia its a war between civilization and barbarism
5185549 thank you mr president helen thomas at the white house
5185550 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion
5185551 body parts were flying through the air i immediately realized that farooqs party was targeted and he was probably dead
5185552 i rushed to the scene of the explosion to see terrified people running everywhere and women calling for their missing children
5185553 the situation was chaotic and horrible i saw dead bodies wounded people and blood stains on the ground later ambulances arrived and picked both the wounded and the dead he said
5185554 we had received information that we would be targeted by groups within azamiyah and within the awakening movement itself
5185555 one of my favorite people of all time is ms ellen degeneres
5185556 so i wish all the best all the happiness all the joy that comes with that certificate just the joy of being able to stand up and say that in front of everyone you love and care about in front of each other and to walk away legal is huge
5185557 i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breast feed them
5185558 i dont know if i can do it to all but i will try
5185559 they are doing well but they still need a lot of care
5185560 what they need most is a dwelling to live in i hope the government will give them an apartment
5185561 this is the oldest identification of fingerprints by post mortem remains
5185562 we will be presenting the list as part of a resolution and charge sheet in the joint houses and god willing that should happen this week
5185563 he should tender his resignation pack up his bags and go
5185564 whatever little moral authority was left has now been completely eroded
5185565 this thing must be clear to everyone that president musharraf is not going to resign period
5185566 this is an issue that is not on the table
5185567 we want stability in the country we want political stability
5185568 there may have been more olympians in 2004 but there were a lot more dead people in iraq too now violence is down 80 percent those are more important numbers
5185569 why should fdr have attended a ceremony created solely to give respectability to nazi germany sports above politics was the sports boycott of south africa which hastened the end of apartheid wrong
5185570 the administration is a bit behind the curve on this they didnt understand what was coming
5185571 theres a whole number of issues they deliberately engineer to show they are an important power
5185572 they interpret weakness as a sign that they can go further
5185573 when you have a loss of life it really elevates things
5185574 this is mr deebs hobby hes still got bunches of ideas i think mr deeb has crossed a line somewhere this is not what we would consider to be a customary home occupation there are regulations about how much youre supposed to have how its detained how its disposed of

5185582 we are confident our new easy peel orange will save our customers a huge amount of time and bother
5185583 this is an incredibly convenient citrus for people to peel and eat on the move or at their desks
5185584 us humans want to stay where were comfortable even if thats a horrible place we gain our identity from our experiences and giving that up does not always come without a fight
5185585 english said the image and message are meant to comment on the hypocrisy of the religious right whose intolerance he compares to that of the mob that urged pontius pilate to sentence jesus christ
5185586 i think our reactions tell us more about ourselves than they ever do about the thins that are causing us to react
5185587 deal with your own shit and think the best of other people cause youll never know

5185591 when you play so nicely like this i think you deserve a big hug special treat extra privilege
5185592 if you dont settle down ill have to ask you to leave the room and return when you can stay here quietly
5185593 the shepherd doesnt leave his flock when the wolf comes
5185594 the ways of hashem are always good you know yaely about this we do not question
5185595 you are part of a good strong chain you know
5185596 she has died the good woman mrs lia waldman daughter of the nagybaner rav may her soul be entwined in the bouquet of life
5185597 left and right all americans know that freedom is better that slavery that love is better than hate kindness better than cruelty tolerance better than bigotry we dont always know how we know these things and yet mysteriously we know them nonetheless
5185598 the true complexity arises when we must defend these values in a world that does not universally embrace them when we reach the place where we must be intolerant in order to defend tolerance or unkind in order to defend kindness or hateful in order to defend what we love
5185599 whoever is kind to the cruel will end up being cruel to the kind
5185600 members of the antiwar movement wound up being involved in the betrayal of far eastern nations in a genocide and in the suffering today imposed on 30 million people there do those convinced pacifists hear the moans coming from there do they understand their responsibility today or do they prefer not to hear
5185601 obviously you want to win all your home games you want to win all your games period you know youre going to lose some but you dont want to lose them the way we lost which basically amounts to losing before you ever get your first at bat its unfortunate all the blame should go to one person and the right person got that blame
5185602 they caught too much of the plate and they were up they were just really really bad pitches well good pitches to hit
5185603 give up eight expletive runs pretty frustrating thats what it is
5185604 becketts come so far since from when we first got to know him that things that would have got in the way maybe when he was younger wont
5185605 it felt like i didnt have to go out there and try to set up any hitters
5185606 i went up there and threw a lot of fastballs mixed in some offspeed stuff
5185607 i thought the double that got hit off of me by john mcdonald it was a fastball riding up and in and he kept his hands inside the ball got it up in the air and hit off the wall i was really in a more comfortable phase than i have been
5185608 he threw on flat ground today so we werent worried about overuse or a guy throwing a long side were hoping the inning will take a little bit of the edge off going into his start on wednesday
5185609 what we do want to do is if we put a guy on the dl is have him have a chance to come back and pitch with health
5185610 not pitch once and go backwards thats why we did this
5185611 i said what he goes i think youve been doing this and youre forgetting where you are i was shocked i said youve got to be kidding me because we dont try to do that we dont want to do that we want our kids to come up and act right but i dont want them to come through that door with fear i dont think that helps
5185612 its very tough youre kind of just trying to finish it out trying to get a couple guys on stay within yourself
5185613 but easier said than done without that atmosphere without that little extra edge but thats part of being a professional baseball player trying to maintain and do that through the good and the bad times
5185614 he was really good his last outing just one of those days those guys sometimes looked in the right spot sometimes looked at the right pitch and got just the good enough one to hit at the right times it was one of those days josh hasnt had one of those days
5185615 is this going to ruin josh for the year no
5185616 guys start playing games they start guessing and then theyre guessing right
5185617 or they dont and you misfire you make the wrong pitch when a lot of success has gone on offensively it allows you to play the game a little be patient be smart do those things we made some mistakes and we made some good pitches and they did some good hitting
5185618 its going to be a big test especially with the road record weve got to find a way to win games that arent here at fenway you have to do that you cant just keeping winning games at home youve got to find a way to win them on the road
5185619 me and matt kemp were out there looking at each other when they tied it up saying what the hecks going on its a big emotional swing but youve got to jump right back on it and stay mentally tough in that situation
5185620 i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported

5185626 some of us have called relatives in jamaica to hold the phone by the tv some have gotten fancy by using hacker techniques to break into bbc video
5185627 i personally have visited websites in korea china syria russia canada england and the bahamas all in desperation to share in the joy of my jamaican people
5185628 even worse they have colluded with other nations to block our access to videos online this astonishment cannot be measured when the bbcs website says that video is not available in your region five minutes before asafa and usain are to take the track
5185629 we had to resort to creative internet links on bahamian and antiguan online broadcasts

5185631 im going to poland to sign a missile defense agreement in the next couple of days after the nato meeting
5185632 to brussels belgium and warsaw poland departing on august 18
5185633 in warsaw secretary rice will sign a formal agreement with poland on behalf of the united states for the establishment and operation of a ballistic missile defense interceptor site in poland
5185634 this agreement is an important step in our efforts to protect the united states and our european allies from the growing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles
5185635 we are going to help rebuild georgia into a strong georgian state the russians will have failed in their effort to undermine georgia and we will be looking at what we can do with the states around that region as well
5185636 of a heightened security threat based on credible intelligence reporting
5185637 these reports indicate that the enemies of the people of afghanistan intend to attack civilian military and government targets during afghan independence celebrations
5185638 the scene was very tragic the aircraft had come down in the woods there was a clearing where it crashed through
5185639 it was upside down and the top of the roof was crushed one of the engines was some distance away
5185640 it was really very difficult to get into the aircraft we were having to rip off the skin with our hands
5185641 the twin engined aircraft was on quite a low approach to coventry on the normal land path when a smaller aircraft came from the right and the twin engined aircraft struck it side on
5185642 the smaller plane disintegrated immediately and the right engine of the twin aircraft blew up
5185643 whilst we watched the twin engined aircraft bank steeply to the left with smoke coming from its right engine it seemed to level off and climb slightly before dropping steeply down to the left
5185644 i immediately thought it looked like something was wrong then at the last minute just 50 feet up the pilot managed to pull up the nose of the plane
5185645 it looked like he was trying to save the plane from the trees
5185646 but then i realised that the plane was going down and it disappeared into the woods
5185647 it was weird because there was no bang i couldnt believe what i had seen
5185648 two of them were not only commercial pilots but they were also fully qualified instructors they had many many thousands of hours of flying time between them
5185649 it is an absolute tragedy for us because we are a small company we are like a family we know everyone extremely well our thoughts and prayers are with the families
5185650 it had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry
5185651 it was approximately two miles from the runway we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft
5185652 it was a very very routine piece of work and the plane was about to land in a normal routine fashion
5185653 we are excited to expand our launch and support of mgd 64 through this eco friendly medium in the seattle and portland markets
5185654 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5185655 we are waiting for them to come back with the law in english
5185656 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5185657 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5185658 there is a lot of hard earned money that went to waste
5185659 larger banks are probably less hungry for deposits than smaller banks are it is a good way for us to build business
5185660 usted no est intentando equilibrar su vida est vivi ndola
5185661 well i said beauty disadvantaged now beauty is in the eye of the beholder beauty can be a good set of teeth beauty is nice wavy hair beauty can be blue eyes or green eyes beauty is in the eye of the beholder and beauty is only skin deep
5185662 there is such a thing as disposition temperament manners general attractiveness attitude and demeanour all those things tend to make a person attractive
5185663 when i came here it was only a small town and ive seen it grow and people come and go and the old timers have passed
5185664 the people that are coming into town now are coming here to work and find a house and live and bring up their families but with these sort of comments id say humph fancy going up to that place
5185665 the fact that he is actually returning us to the dark ages and making the guys that live in this town seem like sex hungry starved men that will pounce upon the first girl that they see walking down the street
5185666 anyone who moves to mount isa beautiful or not so beautiful they have a great chance to make a great life here it is a fantastic town there is certainly no problem
5185667 if guys have the right attitude then you know any type of girl will be happy to be with them so maybe the guys need to fix their attitudes a little bit
5185668 our goal remains gaining a fair contract and we are prepared to continue to bargain in good faith to reach the agreement our members deserve
5185669 were disappointed that union leadership forced us to this point
5185670 by failing to negotiate a new contract cwa leadership has denied its membership key union protections and benefits
5185671 but we fractured the traffic so parents would have to choose between them in this era people dont want to go to multiple places
5185672 as the officers were in the lower apartment one of the detectives reviewed the search warrant application and realized it was for the upper apartment
5185673 my 12 year old and 6 year old dont want to be home at all
5185674 im always amused at how so many diggers turn a case of stupidity into part of a
5185675 im always amused at how so many diggers turn a case of stupidity into part of a
5185676 if we get a call that there is a police officer coming into our trauma ward we immediately know well need a catheter from the pediatric ward
5185677 companies always put a focus on cutting packaging costs but in this environment they are certainly putting more and more focus
5185678 there is a lot of sophistication to the design of a bottle cap that is often overlooked
5185679 you have to hear the responses inside the shin bet to the release they work day and night to capture and neutralize terrorists and all of it is gone in an instant
5185680 people in the shin bet end up asking why do we capture these people
5185681 a terrorist who plants an explosive device gets 10 years in prison but will end up being released after three or four years this hurts the motivation in the shin bet
5185682 the government realized it could not do a southern hostage deal so it went with the northern hostage deal to reduce public pressure on it
5185683 hamas is demanding 450 heavyweight prisoners who took part in recent terrorist attacks the memories of the victims families are still very raw i dont believe the government can go ahead with this
5185684 on the morning after the release we heard fatah blaming israel whatever happens they will blame israel and fault everyone except for themselves
5185685 the aim of the release is also to show the americans and europeans that we are open minded and that we are helping out the side that we are supposed to be helping
5185686 in the short term this is not a risk the aksa martyrs brigades have been neutralized by the pa for the time being
5185687 but what many in israel do not realize is that while these terrorists may not go back to fighting many will go back to indoctrinating others into terrorism and creating a terror supporting environment
5185688 some will recruit on campuses others will become so called journalists while others will be integrated into institutions or sent abroad these jobs are meant to compensate them for the alleged suffering they underwent in prisons in israel
5185689 i saw them on tv they are very cute i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breastfeed them i dont know if i can do it to all but i will try
5185690 this is a very rare pregnancy something i have never witnessed over my past 33 years in this profession the babies are doing well but they still need a lot of care
5185691 what they need most is a dwelling to live in
5185692 i hope the government will give them an apartment with the help of allah they will make it but i think that it will be difficult
5185693 one of my favorite people of all time is ms ellen degeneres
5185694 so i wish all the best all the happiness all the joy that comes with that certificate just the joy of being able to stand up and say that in front of everyone you love and care about in front of each other and to walk away legal is huge
5185695 i love ellen degeneres i watch her show all the time

5185707 sunday is the day that visitors usually leave this area
5185708 but there are more leaving now a sign that the evacuation is going well
5185709 nobody expected me to win so there was no pressure and all i had to do was execute
5185710 all three of us will be on the podium that is going to be an amazing and historic moment for jamaica
5185711 i grew up watching the olympics and see how many times jamaica comes so close to getting a gold medal for us to go one two three jamaican is saying something
5185712 i knew we had a strong team it was anybodys game anybodys day getting on that line they chose to show up and we didnt it definitely hurts its very humbling we kind of take for granted the fact that weve been on top of tons of olympics before it was hard on me getting second in 2004 so its definitely hard on us for nobody to medal
5185713 its an inspiration to all jamaica and particularly to our young people
5185714 im just going to focus on my next race and not worry about this one because i still felt great
5185715 it was just a fine tune up for my 200
5185716 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
5185717 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
5185718 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
5185719 it seemed like the cost in terms of how it changed the community was too high
5185720 its hard when change is for the common good but some people suffer more than others
5185721 dad taught us such respect for the land for my father to be part of this
5185722 in one day youre meeting resistance and theyre not seeing it the way youre seeing it
5185723 you spend four years trying to generate the most compelling opportunities and all of a sudden in one day you couldnt possibly do them all
5185724 is exactly the kind of thing we anticipated but i dont think you could imagine it would be happening at this level
5185725 one can go from rooster to feather duster very quickly
5185726 we understand how quickly a landscape can change in any industry
5185727 dan kami juga telah mengutus luth kepada kaumnya ingatlah tatkala dia berkata kepada kaumnya mengapa kamu mengerjakan perbuatan faahisyah itu yang belum pernah dikerjakan oleh seorangpun di dunia ini sebelummu
5185728 janganlah seorang laki laki melihat aurat laki laki jangan pula perempuan melihat aurat perempuan janganlah seorang laki laki tidur dengan laki laki dalam satu selimut begitu juga janganlah perempuan tidur dengan perempuan dalam satu selimut
5185729 rasulullah saw melarang laki laki yang meniru perempuan dan perempuan yang meniru laki laki

5185731 we care and we are concerned about the well being of the displaced people from other countries
5185732 everything was in place to ensure that when shelters are closed no person was going to be left on the street

5185766 i thought the end of the world had come water was everywhere we lost food homes and in some areas people drowned but i was shocked when the president merely announced a state of emergency and flew back to his home in kampala
5185767 by the time president museveni visited teso food had not reached the affected people over 70 per cent of the affected population was in dire need of food
5185768 the gardens that i saw submerged in water were in the wetlands water is reclaiming its rightful place in the wetlands
5185769 for us in teso it is no longer politics that counts but service delivery we expect the president to address pertinent issues affecting our people that have not been attended to by his government

5185779 there is a strong possibility that he might announce his resignation but there is equally a chance that he might commit a blunder
5185780 our stance is still the same that those who violated the constitution should not be given safe passage or indemnity of his actions
5185781 he is a wise man he is a very experienced
5185782 his political fate has been sealed whatever he says doesnt matter

5186007 i was speaking to a couple of players yesterday theres a lot of uncertainty and there always seems to be these big decisions to be made
5186008 it is an important time for cricket everyone has identified that players and administrators
5186009 but as was the case throughout my career you just take the advice of the experts in the security field and thats what ca and the players association are continuing to do and the players would trust that opinion i have no doubt about that
5186010 the important issue now is for us to work with the icc we are not in the business of going to players and asking their answers prior to us making a decision
5186011 i work very closely with paul marsh the australian cricketers association chief executive and individual players from time to time but we are not deliberately interfering with the players preparation at the moment until we have got something to tell them
5186012 our view is quite simply we need now to see where the icc choose to go with this im sure they will come back to us in the next few days as always we are working with all of our parties and that decision will play itself out in due course
5186013 the icc are the ones who are in control of both the detail and the possible alternative venue so im sure we all understand that its their position now
5186014 despite the presence of so many people in the courtroom the dog did not bite or bark at anyone
5186015 its being treated like every other proposed project in the city
5186016 thats going to be really detrimental to los angeles because we pump in hundreds of millions of dollars here
5186017 i mean were talking about planting trees and donating t shirts for kids
5186018 but i couldnt continue assigning idiotic books that are starting to break 200
5186019 im a right wing economist so they cant call me a communist
5186020 what makes us rich as a society is what we know and what we can do

5186022 reasonable to conclude that individual student expenditures can easily approach 700 to 1 000 today even after supplies are subtracted
5186023 publishers have broken an implicit contract with academics in which we gave our time and they werent too greedy
5186024 do you think all these phds are so lazy so stupid they buy junk
5186025 god bless anybody who has got the energy and commitment to put three four five years of labor in on a book and then give it away
5186026 i spent definitely over a grand on textbooks last year and i did buy used off amazon com
5186027 for all its popularity in the press and on blogs online textbooks are all very marginal now
5186028 something that i thought i could do and that i could admire it was like a midlife crisis
5186029 is the last word at least in the american heritage dictionary which claims its a tropical weevil unlike its namesake zyzzyva has no appetite for the wanton destruction of plants it does aspire to be if not the last word at least an important vehicle for west coast writers
5186030 we dont italicize it in print we just print it like english and that is a huge change
5186031 one of the things i have kind of specialized in
5186032 is discovering new writers and what that really means is giving them their first time in print in print they can see it that is the impact of the printed word
5186033 this is real its physical and it draws from the tradition of 500 years or if you want to go way back to the doodles on the caves it is about making a mark in the world and certainly the cyberworld has its own reality but it is not a reality that yet feels substantial
5186034 look at the candidate and say does he live with integrity service with humility share with generosity or not
5186035 they were very different in personality in philosophy in direction in goals and in vision and theres nothing wrong with that
5186036 it was a powerful forum in that we were exposed to the soul of who these two men were
5186037 before this i only got what pundits wanted us to hear issues of character issues of value you dont usually hear those types of things
5186038 it gave us a chance to compare and contrast how they could handle things in different situations
5186039 i could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says i dont need god
5186040 theyre saying im totally self sufficient by myself and nobody is self sufficient to be president by themselves its too big a job
5186041 campaign 2008 is starting to feel like a sunday school bible drill
5186042 i dont see what good it will do for the american people to again hear the candidates spout pious platitudes about their favorite bible verses or how devout they are
5186043 why should one of these important events be orchestrated entirely by only one pastor who comes out of one narrow segment of our diverse country
5186044 a lot of people misjudged our motives and why we were trying to do this as a church and how we were doing it
5186045 afterward so many did say that this has the potential to change the climate of the election
5186046 it was good to have that kind of civil discourse with the candidates
5186047 it was a courageous step for rick warren that he stepped out and asked questions that represented us
5186048 he solidified for me what i thought he was about
5186049 peanuts at bat the life amp art of charles m schulz
5186050 we have received complaints from fans who said that they would like to go to the beach and the ballgame but cant do both
5186051 the best part of it is that its relatively cheap and it leads to a much more compelling pedestrian environment and real estate values go up because its permanent
5186052 critics say lets put in a dash system but a dash bus can always go away a streetcar if done correctly comes with landscaping shelters trash cans and because its putting eyes on the street it makes neighborhoods safer
5186053 i like that they understand the value and are willing to have free service in the downtown area theyve somehow learned that its not a subsidy its an investment
5186054 the most stable unit in society right now is the family and that is based on a marriage between a man and a woman it has been that way for thousands and thousands of years its the best way to raise kids its that simple
5186055 this amendment would essentially enshrine discrimination into the constitution a perfect example of state sponsored discrimination
5186056 once you start that game why is it two people why cant it be more people why cant it be animals you destroy the institution
5186057 there is nothing in the california education code that requires schools to teach anything about marriage at all
5186058 actually i dont think they should have a position on it
5186059 luke i am the game you wish youd waited to make
5186060 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5186061 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5186062 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5186063 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5186064 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5186065 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5186066 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet

5186105 adjuvant radiation therapy is not associated with worse outcomes and should be considered in the management of surgically resected pancreatic cancer patients
5186106 there is current debate whether radiation therapy should be administered in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings
5186107 standard treatment recommendations advocate ebrt in the adjuvant setting ebrt should continue to be studied in the investigational setting in neoadjuvant protocols
5186108 a recent randomized phase iii trial from europe demonstrated a detrimental effect from the use of adjuvant radiation therapy
5186109 these results have been largely discounted in the united states because of concerns regarding protocol deviation and disparate techniques of radiation delivery although our report was a retrospective analysis of a large cohort of us patients it nevertheless demonstrates no detriment with adjuvant radiation therapy and even indicates that there may be a survival advantage with adjuvant radiation therapy

5187297 when i asked her why especially the frogs she said that red legged frogs only live in wetlands and they signify life because thats where we all came from the wetlands and so the red legged frogs also signify life to humans and that in the pacheenacht belief when the last red legged frog dies all of humanity will also die

5187310 the president will address the nation at 1 00 pm 0700 gmt
5187311 the president is determined to defend himself he will fight on he has given no indication that he will accept the charges against him
5187312 there is a strong possibility that he might announce his resignation but there is equally a chance that he might commit a blunder
5187313 our stance is still the same that those who violated the constitution should not be given safe passage or indemnity of his actions
5187314 he is a wise man he is a very experienced
5187315 his political fate has been sealed whatever he says doesnt matter

5187327 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5187328 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5187329 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5187330 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5187331 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5187332 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that

5187338 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5187339 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5187340 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5187341 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5187342 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5187343 as we know feral cats devastate native animal numbers so this is a step in the right direction in addressing the problem
5187344 its a case of pick a number it is unknown and very hard to tell how many there are out there
5187345 despite the value cats have to our lives many unwanted cats are received by shelters and animal welfare organisations while others add to the stray or feral cat populations
5187346 responsible cat ownership is the primary step in reducing the number of unwanted domestic cats and addressing the issue of stray and feral cat populations
5187347 we are anxious the federal government understands that there will be very significant growth in freight over the next 10 to 15 years a doubling of the freight task and 90 per cent will be export orientated
5187348 it means we can no longer look at road and rail separately but using them as a combined form of transport as part of a national supply chain
5187349 our road infrastructure is pretty good but our rail infrastructure has been under done for decades
5187350 road and rail is an integrated solution we need both as a solution
5187351 we spent time looking at rail it has to be significant infrastructure to qualify for the fund
5187352 while there has been parking made available at the rear of the centrelink building motorists are continuing to park for long periods of time on street
5187353 this is creating parking availability issues for motorists requiring short term parking options
5187354 it resulted in an increase in the number of hospital beds being used by those who would be better served by an aged care bed
5187355 its for this reason that earlier this year the rudd government set up a 300 million zero real interest loans programme to help create 2500 permanent residential aged care places in areas designated as high need
5187356 while i appreciate there are some concerns from some within the aged care sector the reality is that we have invested 300 million to fundamentally increase the number of aged care places
5187357 the rudd government has delivered an additional increase in the level of the conditional adjustment payment which was introduced in 2004 05
5187358 the cap provided additional medium term financial assistance to residential aged care providers while encouraging them to become more efficient through improved management practices
5187359 from july 1 we increased the cap level by a further 1 75 per cent so that it will reach 8 75 per cent
5187360 the value of this increase over the four years to 2011 12 is more than 407 million nationally
5187361 i have said that aged care is an issue for us all it is not about what we did as a government it is about what labor will do
5187362 the howard government commissioned a major review into aged care called the hogan report which produced major reform while i can say that towards the end of last year there was some stress in the aged care sector
5187363 as a result of the hogan reforms in 2004 05 we introduced a special cap so that aged care providers were getting inflation plus 1 75 per cent and i understand that the current government is reviewing that formula
5187364 we improved the bed ratio from 96 per thousand when we came to office to between 104 and 106 per thousand so jodie campbells comments blaming john howard wont do a thing for the aged care sector
5187365 the funds complement contributions by all the local united nations agencies
5187366 a neurons excitability whether it will fire hinges on this delicate equilibrium

5187369 perhaps kafkas biographers simply dont like the idea that their literary idol was helped out in this way in the vital early stages of his career of the worlds authors only shakespeare generates more phds more biographies more coffee table books everything kafka wrote every postcard he ever sent every page of his diary is regarded as a potential ark of the covenant yet no one has ever shown his readers kafkas porn

5187379 probably the pressure on him was too big every chinese wanted him to win the gold medal
5187380 they have a larger team than they have ever had they have a hometown advantage the pride of competing here in front of their own people and plus you are at home you are eating your own food in your own hometown and sleeping in your own bed
5187381 although chinas sports delegation has achieved results at this stage we should still keep a clear mind
5187382 we never considered surpassing someone in the medal tally as our goals
5187383 rowing is a sport which the europeans have been good at for a long time but we proved the chinese can also do well in this sport
5187384 i think the difference between the united states and china in final results at the end of the week will be very close and china might end up winning one or two more gold medals ahead of the u s but the u s will still end up at the top of the medals table
5187385 we saw the pain but liu was determined to run liu would not withdraw unless the pain was intolerable or there was no way out

5187394 we need extraordinary efforts to face the numerous challenges facing us even though the overall economy of our region has continued to grow at steady pace we are still far from achieving a better life for all our people
5187395 as we do what we do let us keep in mind that the success of our integration will be measured by the extent to which it contributes to our shared development goals

5187428 bee is a really terrific candidate for the republicans i dont think they could have gotten a better candidate
5187429 if he had run against giffords last time when the seat was open he might have beaten her
5187430 within the time that the republican brand name nationwide and within arizona is in peril
5187431 youve got to assume at this point in time that giffords is the front runner and has the advantage of incumbency
5187432 we have a very strong organization ive got some of the top leaders and campaign volunteer organizations in the state
5187433 were feeling very good about our position at this time
5187434 we will be seeing the republican national party putting in more
5187435 i take the fact that hes bringing in washington heavyweights to campaign for him as a sign of republicans objective to take this seat away
5187436 it actually took the same number of days flying to get there as it did driving

5187439 the eaa knew it was getting close to the number and wanted a way to mark the milestone
5187440 it was a big surprise i guess i had the lucky number
5187441 i built it inside the two car garage at our house he said
5187442 at one point after finishing the wings i had to store them in the living room because i needed room in the garage to work on the fuselage
5187443 you can try to build one of these yourself but you really cant you are going to need help along the way
5187444 there are also some special tools specific to the airplane industry you are going to need but they arent too expensive
5187445 i was excited and apprehensive but the plane flew great and performed well
5187446 it is still why im driving my 15 year old saturn
5187447 i remember as a child going out into our backyard and measuring it to see if we had enough room to land an airplane he said
5187448 when i realized we didnt i thought maybe a helicopter would work
5187449 what were paying for hay this year is twice as much as it was three or four years ago every time we buy feed its more expensive
5187450 its forced us to raise our lesson prices to cover what its costing us to maintain our lesson horses
5187451 all my animals are family to me so it was very difficult to give him up but the expense of supporting a horse has become such a financial strain for me i needed to do what was best for cheyenne
5187452 i decided to give him away because i wanted him to go to a good home where hed get the best possible care
5187453 families with three or four backyard horses are scaling back on the number of animals theyre willing to support
5187454 food prices for horse owners are absolutely tremendous right now
5187455 the dramatic rise in hay costs has created some serious cash problems for horse owners across the state were experiencing an inflationary market right now and everyone is feeling it
5187456 horse rescues and sanctuaries across the country are literally overflowing right now

5187463 theres gotta be so much more that this building can be
5187464 this is a totally new look its to bring a lifestyle that hasnt been here before i call it a cosmopolitan lifestyle the concept is to be able to see out of the building you are in an environment that is part of the outside world
5187465 there has been little to no supply of this type of offering weve had interest from people in boston new york the foothills ive even had a call from a person in dubai the skeptics say downtown is a lost cause its really not its the new frontier
5187466 it wasnt until i got really interested in revitalizing downtown that motivated me to look at these other properties
5187467 i think the public will be pleasantly surprised sooner rather than later i think certain projects such as this one have a very high probability for success because it leans toward redevelopment as opposed to projects that cost hundreds of millions of dollars that downtown is not ready to support
5187468 its definitely a modern refiguring to be more functional and playful

5187489 the first half was as good as we can play
5187490 having not won anything last year we go in to this season with a real determination and i think we showed that
5187491 we just wanted to play as well as we can we wanted to start all guns blazing
5187492 last year we had a difficult start and the football we played in the first half was top drawer
5187493 its not easy to come to a different country and settle in as quickly as he has his touch is fantastic and hes obviously going to be a great signing for us
5187494 i think the owner is happy like the other fans
5187495 portsmouth after five or 10 minutes didnt think wed play like we were and we were more aggressive than last season i think they were surprised by our team
5187496 lampard is not brazilian hes english but he touched the ball very well it was his style
5187497 where do you get good loans id like to try but its not easy
5187498 i think rooney can be both a second forward and score goals
5187499 he has played in two games for me and did very well in both he didnt score but i was very happy with the performances
5187500 ashley has been fantastic for us im pleased gabby and john have signed new contracts and weve got a couple more players that we are looking to do exactly the same with with ashley young being one of them
5187501 we are in conversation about that i dont think the chairman randy lerner has any major problem about sorting out wages for people if they are doing the business week in and week out on the pitch
5187502 agbonlahor has done that in my two seasons here carew has been terrific since being swapped with milan baros at lyon and young has been absolute class
5187503 it means he will get a new contract ashley hasnt come and asked for anything
5187504 he has got a number of years left to run on his contract but id like to sort him out and i am sure he is enjoying his football here which is great
5187505 if he continues to play in the fashion he is for us who knows what might happen to him in the future but we would be delighted to keep him a bit longer
5187506 it is a huge blow for valeri we are all desperately disappointed for the lad it looks like he has completely snapped his achilles it looks like he is going to be out for six months
5187507 that is on top of being out for 12 months so it is a massive setback for him
5187508 i thought we were very much in the game when you come to villa you have to deal with the physical presence of the front guy carew and the pace they have in the side and you have to deal with set plays which i think we did in the first half
5187509 the blow of conceding quickly after half time knocked us somewhat but we came back and we were very much in the game at 1 1

5187521 i hate the song it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family and she knows how disappointed her father and i are i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
5187522 katy is our daughter and we love her but we strongly disagree with how she is conducting herself at the moment we cannot cut her out of our lives as she is our child but she knows we disagree strongly with what she is doing and the message she is promoting regarding homosexuality which the bible clearly states is a sin but the bible also promotes understanding and forgiveness which i keep reminding myself katy is not a homosexual but i fear she has been led astray by the hollywood crowd i pray all the time that god will work through her and help her find salvation
5187523 some outfits are too revealing and her father has had words with her about it like any child she is going through a period of rebellion
5187524 katy was raised in a very strict christian household she started performing in church at nine she was a special child she loved to sing and had an angelic voice that is why this is all so disappointing and sad

5187538 en el caso que nos ocupa en consecuencia el plazo de prescripci n de un a o que se establece en el vigente art 142 ley 30 92 como antes en los arts 40 y 41 lrjae se vio interrumpido primero por la pendencia del procedimiento penal siendo as que por no constar la fecha de notificaci n de la sentencia que lo puso fin no se acredita que transcurriera un a o desde esa notificaci n hasta la interposici n de la demanda civil y despu s por la tramitaci n de este procedimiento civil sin que tampoco transcurriera el plazo desde que fue dictada m s desde la notificaci n la sentencia de la audiencia provincial hasta que se formul la reclamaci n administrativa de responsabilidad civil conforme a la doctrina antes expuestas el efecto interruptivo de ambos procedimientos deriva de que en ellos se trataba de hacer efectiva la responsabilidad civil de la administraci n con independencia de que en el primero la condici n de imputado o denunciado recayera sobre el joven que salt compareciendo el ayuntamiento como responsable civil directo y de que en el segundo se demandara tambi n al socorrista era evidente la aparente trascendencia de ambos procedimientos para concretar la responsabilidad del ayuntamiento y determinar la procedencia o no del ejercicio de la acci n correspondiente y la v a o jurisdicci n competente para ello de manera que s lo cuando se descart la existencia de responsabilidad penal y consecuentemente la inviabilidad de la responsabilidad del ayuntamiento en esa sede y despu s la incompetencia de la jurisdicci n civil se estuvo en condiciones de ejercer la acci n que ahora se plantea en esta jurisdicci n acci n que en definitiva no estaba prescrita estando ya en condiciones la sala para entrar a conocer el fondo del asunto
5187539 pero es que adem s en absoluto puede decirse que el funcionamiento del servicio fuera normal sino que por el contrario y si bien en parte indirectamente a trav s del socorrista como persona empleada por el ayuntamiento ha de calificarse como anormal incorrecto irregular o negligente
5187540 como se ha apuntado lo relevante verdaderamente es la actuaci n del socorrista pero sobre la base a su vez de que se trataba de una piscina que por sus caracter sticas pod a considerarse de alto riesgo lo que determinaba la necesidad de extremar las medidas de vigilancia y provisi n
5187541 cierto es que como pone de manifiesto el letrado de la administraci n la causa inmediata del golpe y de las lesiones fue la acci n del ba ista que cay sobre el recurrente y que este ba ista entr en el agua de la forma descrita que ya hemos calificado de peligrosa y negligente
5187542 pero es m s atendiendo a las circunstancias concurrentes hemos de concluir que es la actuaci n negligente administrativa la que tiene la intensidad e importancia suficiente para hacer que la conducta del tercero en principio y abstractamente tambi n negligente se repute irrelevante en la producci n del resultado y por tanto que ni tan siquiera estamos ante un supuesto de concurso de causas sino de culpa exclusiva de la administraci n

5187679 at the beginning she was very worried about me fighting she used to ask me all the time why i wanted to get punched in the face and get all beat up just to make some money but now she understands the sport more and is a big fan she buys the pay per views now even when im not fighting the sports getting bigger and bigger and she gets very excited watching it now
5187680 she watches my fights but only if she knows the result first
5187681 shell only ever watch my fights if ive won if i dont win shell never watch it the last one she never watched
5187682 its really hard to fight a guy reljic you have no information about
5187683 i never watched one of his fights or even knew what kind of style he had the guy was a southpaw he had very good high kicks and i knew none of that before the fight
5187684 were all professionals and we all need to prepare as well as we are able to before a fight when i fought reljic i wasnt able to prepare like i would have wanted to he has good jiu jitsu lots of high kicks and was a very strong fighter i was doing fine and just got caught hey sh t happens we both won some extra money for fight of the night so i cant complain
5187685 when i was at light heavyweight i used to just stay around 225 lbs and then cut the 25 lbs to make weight now im looking to stay at around 205 lbs ive been fighting my whole career at 205 even though a lot of people were saying i should be fighting at 185 when i compare myself to big light heavyweights like forrest griffin and chuck liddell i look more like a middleweight those guys are huge i never had to cut properly to make light heavyweight and always decided to stay there because i love to eat so much now im doing the diet and am a lot healthier im feeling better than ever
5187686 hes fought pretty much everyone to fight a guy like that ive got to be at the top of my game and ive got to be ready in all departments
5187687 for him horn the cage and everything that goes with it will not be a problem for him the cage is like his living room hes very used to it hell be ready for everything i bring he has an incredible name beating a legend like horn will make a big splash in the middleweight division
5187688 this fight with horn makes much more sense than the one with reljic
5187689 when i fought reljic i was coming off four wins in a row and nobody knew who reljic was now im fighting a guy like jeremy who is a legend in the sport even if he is coming off two losses when i first started out in mma jeremy was already there beating guys like chuck liddell this fight makes more sense to the fans and for jeremy and me
5187690 im no different however the reason i dropped to 185 is because i know i can be really good i know i can become a champion at this weight i want to start over again at 185 ive never fought at 185 before and i feel like its a new start my goal is to make a lot of money and become the champ
5187691 i respect jeremy a lot and know hes going to be a tough fight but beyond him ive got a list of middleweights id love to fight id really love to fight rich franklin thales leites and dan henderson a guy like franklin would be perfect for my next fight after jeremy
5187692 at middleweight i feel like im going to do some serious damage all my fights are pretty exciting whether i win or lose i try and put up an exciting fight for the fans
5187693 i lost my father when i was 12 and was raised by my mother along with my younger brother and sister it was kind of tough but my mom did everything she could and gave us all a good life and good education i think education is the most important thing and it was great to receive the education we did i cant complain about anything
5187694 jiu jitsu in brazil is a very common sport everybody does it all my friends pretty much everyone i knew did jiu jitsu as a kid after that it was like a snowball effect i met a guy who loved fighting and he was my biggest sponsor then we decided to move into mma i realized i was pretty good at it and the snowball just kept getting bigger and bigger now im able to feed my family doing this thing i love it
5187695 just being in the ufc has made me very proud and happy

5187770 application did not have a place for me to enter my past medical history medication lists etc i think for this application to work for my patients this feature needs to be in place
5187771 not easy to configure for the average non techy over age 60 who are the patients that will need this type of monitoring
5187772 this extension is required to provide us with time to work with the regulatory agencies and receive the necessary comfort on the outstanding issues before making the final investment decision
5187773 the acquisition of additional port terminals has always been a key component of polaris development strategy and the pier b site is one option that could allow us to enter the los angeles market the largest construction aggregates market in california we expect that our terminal development initiatives in southern california will allow us to build a strong platform to continue achieving our long term growth plans and it is essential that we prepare the ground in anticipation of the market resuming its growth in demand
5187774 due to a large increase in the number of offences related to the sale of drink to people under 18
5187775 we recognise some retailers have done much to reduce underage sales but are pleased rogue retailers are beginning to feel the combined force of tough action by the police using test purchasing operations and the licensing boards suspending licences
5187776 this the first time we have carried out test purchases at these smaller community shops
5187777 they are usually in highly populated residential areas and are possibly seen as easier targets for young people wanting to buy alcohol
5187778 it was very disappointing that a quarter of the shops tested sold alcohol the young girl on the spot fines of 80 were given to each shop assistant who made the sale
5187779 i opted for rafael sobis because of the way he has improved in training and during the games
5187780 rafael is a player who can survive tough marking who opens up spaces who can make diagonal runs and doesnt get caught offside he gets involved in training and he is used to these types of games in the libertadores
5187781 im not going to come back but theyll be pleased
5187782 not as good as those great players out there so im pretty happy with my result right now
5187783 playing with all these great golfers out here and competing with those great golfers i think is going to make me develop my game and give me lots of confidence when i get ready for the u s amateur
5187784 it was that kind of week where i had nothing to lose a win win whether i play great and move on to next week or obviously sometimes theres more important things in life than playing golf

5187786 and you know i knew exactly where i was on the list

5187816 normalmente si hubo una relaci n afectiva hay un proceso de duelo y como todo proceso tiene varias fases hay momentos de mucho coraje negaci n resignaci n y hacia el final del duelo se trata de reparar y volver a encontrar un sentido en la vida
5187817 las compras compulsivas son un problema que a veces se utiliza para vivir duelos o situaciones no resueltas no lo puedo decir de salma pero de que es posible lo es
5187818 el duelo puede ser intenso dependiendo de lo que se perdi si la relaci n fue muy intensa afectivamente con mucho compromiso se tarda de seis a 12 meses en resolverse dependiendo de la intensidad

5187841 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5187842 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5187843 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5187844 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5187845 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5187846 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5187847 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5187848 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5187849 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
5187850 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
5187851 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
5187852 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5187853 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5187854 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5187855 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5187856 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars
5187857 i will file an application to compel the attorney general and the minister for environment to obey the court orders by forming the commission
5187858 it hurt but the adrenaline started flowing and i felt a lot better as the race went on
5187859 we were going back and forth and i was looking to make a strong push at the end of the race i got a better drive than benny solis did and i was able to get the win it feels really good to get two in a row and it was a lot of fun for me to get to race with these guys it was a lot harder than mid ohio battling with people is really fun you dont know when theyre going to pass you or when youre going to pass them
5187860 i went wide when i went through the double corner and i didnt have enough power to get back to the line first i tried my best and ended up second im pretty happy with my lead in the championship but the next couple of races i will try to get more podiums or wins
5187861 with the two red flags i felt i had to get a good start
5187862 i rode strong and the ktm rc 125 was great i was fourth today and i wanted to be a little higher but it was a good race and a lot of fun all of the guys at the front rode really well today i feel good about the result and i want to thank everyone that helps us race
5187863 its okay because i ended up fifth and i am happy for the points and the championship
5187864 it involves some finesse and technique its an art its a craft and it takes practice like any instrument
5187865 the emotion of the moment of the lyrics causes them to overuse the muscles or the vocal folds and they become swollen
5187866 about rectifying the balance between the breath pressure and vocal cords
5187867 it doesnt sound like singing at all it sounds like mayhem and noise and violence
5187868 since he knew i was a voice teacher he thought i could figure something out i had really no idea what i was dealing with
5187869 there was this kind of mentality when this kind of metal became more popular that if you took singing lessons you were a sissy
5187870 a rite of passage especially with metal because its such an aggressive hazing experience
5187871 melissa gets what were trying to do within our realm of metal and hard core shes the premiere vocal coach
5187872 screaming in front of 70 000 people can be a pretty powerful experience
5187873 i couldnt find anyone who was growling i think thats why cross is special she embraces it and openly teaches it
5187874 i appeal to you that after your armed forces leave georgian territory to start serious thinking and discussions about further negotiations a further search for ways to conduct relations in order not to sow discord between our countries for good
5187875 lets not sow discord for future generations i dont appeal to your mercy but i appeal to your pragmatism and simple common sense i think the time to make the right decisions has come
5187876 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5187877 for them the hardliners the strategic aim of the invasion was not achieved so it was a defeat this creates problems in moscow
5187878 they may not be against subduing the georgians but the question is at what price
5187879 all we can do now is go back and see how it all plays out
5187880 well come out tuesday and compete and play the way team canada is supposed to play
5187881 whatever you need to do to get more opportunities to score is what we need
5187882 i think the authority that was given to him was to rewrite bills if theres any tweaking that needs to be done hes just writing legislation not rewriting legislation
5187883 it was wrong for him to give the firearm to somebody else we expected him to behave better because he has had the gun since 1970s
5187884 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
5187885 llevamos tiempo hablando con las operadoras y est n siendo receptivas comprenden nuestro problema y entienden que algo hay que hacer porque la situaci n actual no se puede prorrogar mucho m s
5187886 implicar al gobierno en estas conversaciones para que esto se convierta en ley y no sea s lo un pacto entre empresas
5187887 espa a es uno de los pa ses con tasas de pirater a m s altas del mundo y de hecho hemos sido incorporados a una lista realizada por eeuu con los estados que no respetan los derechos de propiedad intelectual
5187888 si la situaci n de falta de compromiso contin a
5187889 la sociedad espa ola ha practicado la demagogia con los derechos de autor a diferencia de otros pa ses de nuestro entorno ya que aqu no se entiende por qu hay que proteger los derechos de los trabajadores de la cultura
5187890 la cultura no puede ser gratis ya que es un bien que se transmite previo pago porque detr s de su construcci n se encuentra el esfuerzo y el talento de una persona
5187891 revel una actitud muy positiva pero que al final no va m s all de las intenciones y las palabras
5187892 no se venden discos en las tiendas porque los m s j venes se los descargan por internet lo mismo que pasa con los dvd de las pel culas o la asistencia a los cines que ha ca do de forma dram tica
5187893 the outcome of the talks hinges on the army generals and mugabe is only there as a figure head
5187894 the military remains deeply suspicious of tsvangirai and some commanders feel that they have sacrificed a lot for mugabe to lose out their positions just like that
5187895 a zanu pf clique is now seeking to subvert the process as they think president mugabe made too many concessions
5187896 that is why you see that even though the principals are bound by the terms of the mou memorandum of understanding not to leak information to the media confidential information is now finding its way to the state media
5187897 whatever ive got in my career now i would have had a great deal more if id played in los angeles or chicago you name a town somewhere they were just grateful to have me around
5187898 i immediately started apologizing oh excuse me mr sinatra excuse me but sinatra was cool about it he just said oh no problem it was my fault no problem his foot was actually sticking out from under the table and he had some nice what do call them wing tip shoes on so it probably didnt hurt
5187899 it is for discipline that you endure god is treating you as sons
5187900 when the governor calls a special session the governor is supposed to have an agenda
5187901 mayhem at franks no audio leaves aussie function in tatters angry drunk aussies invading next door functions

5187903 holy hand job at a hot dog stand did li ning just friggin well fly across the top of the stadium
5187904 im all for america taking over some of those smaller countries if it will result in a shorter opening ceremony
5187905 we would not scrap any scheme once it was underway
5187906 the last three years have been enormously consequential for telstra and australia with the full privatisation of telstra construction of the worlds largest fastest and most advanced wireless broadband network and the transformation of telstra into the worlds first nextgeneration fully integrated telco
5187907 working in a country and culture not your own is an enormous privilege and working for one of its iconic companies is a privilege amplified
5187908 my time in australia and with telstra has been one of the most memorable experiences of my life both personally and professionally
5187909 i came here expecting to stay for one to two months three years later mary sue and i leave having been welcomed guests in this wonderful country
5187910 it was hard for some to give up the idea that telstra is community property
5187911 the cultural change required by privatisation was difficult both for telstra and for the government
5187912 though we were criticised by some our new approach achieved important results including safeguarding new investments like nextg and adsl2 from value destroying regulation winding back regulation on more than four million copper telephone lines and the reversal of a 1 billion taxpayer gift to singtel optus
5187913 i have always valued phils advice and his principled approach to public policy and communications
5187914 phil has great integrity and has not been afraid to show leadership often speaking the truth even when it was inconvenient for established interests to hear it

5187926 i hope he intends to honour the pledge this time
5187927 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5187928 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5187929 the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5187930 i would say that its very much still on the table
5187931 russia will pay a price we will look seriously with our allies and bilaterally at the consequences of this russian action for russian integration
5187932 he met her eyes at a party now ill meet his face with a fist
5187933 its so scandalous these tales of woe these are professionals and this is all they know
5187934 clients perceptions of how reorientation therapy and self help can promote changes in sexual orientation
5187935 this is truly the fringe element of the republican party
5187936 these people are out of step with the republican party
5187937 we hope to inform those attending about the rich history and philosophies of so many republican leaders who fought for equality and against discrimination and hate
5187938 i do diet and exercise but this excess skin doesnt seem to go away
5187939 i had a lot of stretch marks hanging pouch and sagging breasts
5187940 he gave me and amazing body with beautiful curves and perky breasts i have recommended him to several of my girlfriends and they have also been very happy with him

5187942 unsere aufgabe als forschungsdienstleister ist es virtuelle technologien mit realen produkten zu verbinden damit sie schneller marktreif werden
5187943 die maschinen werden immer komplizierter die anforderungen ndern sich immer schneller wer mithalten will kommt um die virtualisierung nicht herum
5187944 whoever is elected president will have the power to fundamentally transform the future of abortion politics
5187945 if he selects tom ridge hes going to inflict a mortal wound on his campaign
5187946 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5187947 one of the things that ive always said is that on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception then and you are consistent in that belief then i cant argue with you on that because that is a core issue of faith for you
5187948 what i can do is say are there ways that we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5187949 but i couldnt continue assigning idiotic books that are starting to break 200
5187950 im a right wing economist so they cant call me a communist
5187951 what makes us rich as a society is what we know and what we can do
5187952 anything that stands in the way of the dissemination of knowledge is a real problem
5187953 reasonable to conclude that individual student expenditures can easily approach 700 to 1 000 today even after supplies are subtracted
5187954 publishers have broken an implicit contract with academics in which we gave our time and they werent too greedy
5187955 do you think all these phds are so lazy so stupid they buy junk
5187956 god bless anybody who has got the energy and commitment to put three four five years of labor in on a book and then give it away
5187957 i spent definitely over a grand on textbooks last year and i did buy used off amazon com
5187958 for all its popularity in the press and on blogs online textbooks are all very marginal now
5187959 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside
5187960 it is scorned worldwide afghanistan is backsliding the bar has been set low in iraq georgia is in ruins
5187961 this action is a real challenge to the idea of building a europe whole free and at peace
5187962 jeopardize these nascent democracies by letting them think that they can put themselves in this kind of situation and survive
5187963 you are not just putting democracy on the line in georgia you are putting all of these places in that neighborhood on the line
5187964 i have seen it over and over again be misconstrued by nations not used to dealing with us
5187965 i think they misunderstand our eagerness and enthusiasm and think we are going to be behind them for anything
5187966 that is what happened in hungary in 1956 and in czechoslovakia in 1968
5187967 something that i thought i could do and that i could admire it was like a midlife crisis
5187968 is the last word at least in the american heritage dictionary which claims its a tropical weevil unlike its namesake zyzzyva has no appetite for the wanton destruction of plants it does aspire to be if not the last word at least an important vehicle for west coast writers
5187969 we dont italicize it in print we just print it like english and that is a huge change
5187970 one of the things i have kind of specialized in
5187971 is discovering new writers and what that really means is giving them their first time in print in print they can see it that is the impact of the printed word
5187972 this is real its physical and it draws from the tradition of 500 years or if you want to go way back to the doodles on the caves it is about making a mark in the world and certainly the cyberworld has its own reality but it is not a reality that yet feels substantial
5187973 if customers dont like what you put up there they will let you know
5187974 they even wanted to see the skeet shooting or clay shooting whatever they call it
5187975 everyone wants to see a woman lift 250 pounds over her head
5187976 but i saw it and i watched it and i rooted for one of the teams
5187977 i watched the equestrian dressage which was really kind of weird
5187978 i didnt know it existed but there were people who spent almost their whole lives preparing for this moment
5187979 you get a sense of solitude like you are there on your own
5187980 i cant tell you the names of all the players but you start following them
5187981 they were the closest to us before the war and now they are the most frightening enemy
5187982 it feels like your own brother has cut off your head
5187983 after what happened it should be clear that they should have self determination
5187984 the reality is that for 15 years at least south ossetia and abkhazia have been independent in fact
5187985 its not true the goal of russia is peace in the caucasus
5187986 planul b 2 0 salvarea unei planete sub presiune si a unei civilizatii in impas
5187987 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5187988 per me benedetto xvi un secondo padre con lui si ragiona ma sempre con allegria
5187989 annunciare dio introdurre nella relazione con dio insegnare a pregare la preghiera fede in atto
5187990 riflettere sulluniversalit della missione della chiesa costituita da popoli di ogni razza e cultura
5187991 proprio da qui ha aggiunto proviene la grande responsabilit della comunit ecclesiale chiamata ad essere casa ospitale per tutti segno e strumento di comunione per lintera famiglia umana
5187992 ogni comunit cristiana approfondisca sempre pi questa sua consapevolezza al fine di aiutare anche la societ civile a superare ogni possibile tentazione di razzismo di intolleranza e di esclusione e ad organizzarsi con scelte rispettose della dignit di ogni essere umano una delle grandi conquiste dellumanit infatti proprio il superamento del razzismo purtroppo per di esso si registrano in diversi paesi nuove manifestazioni preoccupanti legate spesso a problemi sociali ed economici che tuttavia mai possono giustificare il disprezzo e la discriminazione razziale

5187994 non dobbiamo abituarci ha detto a questa triste realt troppo prezioso infatti il bene della vita umana e troppo indegno delluomo morire o ritrovarsi invalido per cause che nella maggior parte dei casi si potrebbero evitare occorre certo maggiore senso di responsabilit anzitutto da parte degli automobilisti perch gli incidenti sono dovuti spesso alleccessiva velocit e a comportamenti imprudenti condurre un veicolo sulle pubbliche strade richiede senso morale e senso civico a promozione di questultimo indispensabile la costante opera di prevenzione vigilanza e repressione da parte delle autorit preposte come chiesa invece ci sentiamo direttamente interpellati sul piano etico i cristiani devono prima di tutto fare un esame di coscienza personale sulla propria condotta di automobilisti

5188004 accused of falsely claiming to have been given a title by the hohenzollern family and thereafter of abusing the family name and using the title for personal monetary gain
5188005 the failure has it is submitted been elevated to breach of a rule of law
5188006 the balance is a matter for the judge it is not a matter for the appellate court this court will not interfere with a judges conclusion after weighing all the circumstances in the balance unless he has erred in principle or reached a conclusion which is plainly wrong
5188007 i do not consider that mr justice eady erred in principle in the present case nor that he reached a conclusion which was plainly wrong
5188008 as to principle he took all the main matters carefully into consideration he addressed lord nicholls 10 points in turn but did not regard them or any one or more of them as necessarily or by themselves determinative
5188009 he treated them as relevant considerations not in my view as hurdles each of which a defendant is required to overcome he was entitled to regard the tone of the article as one sided and unbalanced
5188010 the fact that the appellants had not approached the claimant or anyone on his side of the dynastic divide was relevant and an important but not all embracing reason for the judges decision
5188011 it was relevant that the appellants did not report the claimants public denial that he had been a member of the secret police in iron curtain days
5188012 if the editorial judgment was that approaching the claimant would have made no difference the claimant did not have to prove positively that it would have made a difference and this is not a case such as was jameel where all relevant knowledge and information lay elsewhere
5188013 the appellants supposition that inquiries of the claimant or his camp would have been fruitless based on the fact that there had been no response to the press conference was capable of being regarded as mere supposition
5188014 the question was not whether the claimant would have responded but whether it was irresponsible not to ask the judges proposition was that it was a matter of elementary fairness that a serious charge should be accompanied by the gist of any explanation already given
5188015 as if the magic wand of editorial judgment answers all possible criticism of the balance of the article
5188016 he also gave due weight to editorial discretion emphasising that the question was not what he would have done because he is not a journalist

5188047 despite economic uncertainty customers have continued to expand their storage infrastructure and are looking to netapp to help them reduce costs and enable new capabilities
5188048 they have exposed a very limited set of capabilities that this architecture is capable of

5188050 in addition to supporting multiple active controllers clustered systems virtualize the individual controllers and make the entire set of controllers appear as one single storage system to hosts
5188051 i believe the architecture has these features but ibm didnt feel comfortable presenting them to the market yet
5188052 weird nothing from ibm other than the announcement letters posted to ibm com world wide not even a press release no customer stories
5188053 maybe this whole xiv thing wasnt really all that big a deal after all
5188054 theyve taken a very conservative step in presenting this product to the market
5188055 on the contrary i think its because ibm is ibm and they like to do things in a conservative fashion

5188087 i have a 5 year old daughter and at that moment i thought im really glad she didnt come with me
5188088 the adults gasped and almost all the young children started crying
5188089 im sure some rational thinking scientists think its a bad thing
5188090 of course its fun but thats not really the ultimate goal
5188091 its engaging visitors to see other things in the museum and experience the real thing
5188092 they were taking it through its paces and it was mind boggling
5188093 we were creating what the story could be so you could build scenes with action rising to a climax and a resolution
5188094 they like being in on a unique one time thing
5188095 it is a big dinosaur but it isnt school bus sized
5188096 a little archaic in their movement because in general we now think dinosaurs were all very active and agile creatures

5188098 mendis has really bowled well in the tests and his confidence must be sky high along with muralitharan they form a very potent attack but he is not unplayable and we are working on a gameplan to counter him during the one day series
5188099 we will try and play our natural game against him and see how it goes he does not bowl at 150 kmph so there is no reason to be frightened of him when murali was new to international cricket even he bothered many top batsmen and is still bothering them but with time batsmen learn more and adjust to the situations
5188100 i should say i am ready for the one day challenge i have been working hard in the nets i have also practiced some shots which i hope will help me counter the lankan spinners

5188102 they were very different in personality in philosophy in direction in goals and in vision and theres nothing wrong with that
5188103 it was a powerful forum in that we were exposed to the soul of who these two men were

5188109 i dont see what good it will do for the american people to again hear the candidates spout pious platitudes about their favorite bible verses or how devout they are
5188110 why should one of these important events be orchestrated entirely by only one pastor who comes out of one narrow segment of our diverse country
5188111 a lot of people misjudged our motives and why we were trying to do this as a church and how we were doing it
5188112 afterward so many did say that this has the potential to change the climate of the election
5188113 it was good to have that kind of civil discourse with the candidates

5188131 the milf leadership ordered them to pullout get out of the area
5188132 they were not taken hostage they remained unharmed but could not leave the place
5188133 that is why we cannot enter the area they milf are using the civilians as human shields
5188134 the rebels also shot a power transmission facility that caused a brownout
5188135 the recent milf perpetrated incidents in mindanao is a virtual declaration of war against the duly constituted authority
5188136 the afp shall not allow this to go on we are now taking military action to stop these atrocities these developments are clear manifestation of the insincerity to the peace process of a significant portion of the milf

5188147 abi researchs data appears to have been collected just after q1 2008 when demand for blu ray was very high and supplies were low
5188148 because hardware production schedules are arranged many months in advance most player manufacturers needed a fair amount of time to respond to the increased demand my own company
5188149 another factor that must be considered is where we are in the adoption curve for blu ray new publishing formats typically require several years before they can begin to establish themselves in the mass market for comparison purposes i looked back at some old dvd industry newsletters from the end of 1998 roughly the same early point in dvds life that were at now with blu ray and found a couple of analyst quotes that seem short sighted in retrospect one predicted a long and healthy life ahead for another was quoted as saying that dvd hardware sales were slow to take off partly due to consumer confusion

5188160 the fundraising and the acquisition of axismobile is a dramatic acceleration for synchronica and i believe that it will build value for our shareholders we aim to build a world leader in the market of consumer mobile email and synchronization solutions and this acquisition is a key milestone which will improve our competitive positioning and accelerate our commercial growth it will increase our ability to sell to customers particularly to those in emerging economies where we see the largest potential growth for mobile email and synchronization with the fundraising and the acquisition of axismobile synchronica now has sufficient mass and funding to take advantage of the outstanding opportunity to exploit the commercial potential of mass market mobile email the next few years will be an exciting time for us all here at synchronica and for our customers around the globe we look forward with increased confidence from this inflect on point
5188161 this is the start of an exciting new era for axismobile and our customers there are real synergies between synchronicas products and target markets and our own so it makes great commercial sense to combine forces both companies are committed to open standards and to developing products that work on even the most basic of handsets a must given that the market for mass market mobile email is being fuelled by demand from the developing world we are confident that the combined might of our two companies will prove to be greater than the sum of its parts

5188227 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points

5188266 when guys are in the training room theyre not out here practicing youve got to be willing to release them and live with it and pick other people up for more competition
5188267 youd like to pick up some of those guys and bring them in and push some of our guys
5188268 unfortunately there are some guys right now on our roster that are borderline guys that as of today would make it just because we dont have anybody else
5188269 theres a lot of people i still care about here in the bay area
5188270 i love coming back to stanford although i didnt have a chance to go back this trip the bay area is familiar to me and i always liked the bay area
5188271 when i get that many runs i think just throw strikes and be aggressive
5188272 everything was working with that many runs just continue to pound the strike zone
5188273 every time we come here we get some crazy games
5188274 we start out good with the uribe home run and we took advantage of the guy not throwing strikes he was all over the place and when he tried to find the plate we didnt miss them
5188275 i was trying to do too much trying to be very detailed on every pitch and i let it get the best of me
5188276 we have a very good team in all aspects of the game
5188277 we can play defense hit and pitch and our bullpen is very good i think were doing a good job of bringing the same effort level every day
5188278 you come in with the same game plan read up on the pitchers check out the scouting report and thats baseball
5188279 he worked ahead in the count and moved the ball through the strike zone
5188280 he didnt straighten anything out he was sinking it stayed on the corners and was pretty good at it
5188281 we knew we could produce a gold medal winning night we wanted to make our mark on history
5188282 i was actually more nervous watching its all very surreal and hasnt really set in yet
5188283 i got phone calls at 4 in the morning screaming that james was on tv we are thrilled and amazed he definitely deserves it
5188284 we see her pictures here and it drives us to achieve
5188285 when she won silver in athens in 2004 that was amazing
5188286 we havent felt the effects of her winning gold yet but we will
5188287 we have been getting people from all over the country who want to come here and meet the whipples
5188288 for mary to win gold thats definitely exciting a lot of girls want to follow in her footsteps
5188289 the wind was blowing out to left so i think that might have kept it fair
5188290 i was just hoping to get a chance because i hadnt done anything
5188291 then chris got that big hit to start the ninth and it all worked out
5188292 he always has a chance to do what he did and luckily for himself and us he did it
5188293 saturday night we put it together more than we have
5188294 he knows what he does and doesnt do well in a game
5188295 but i think theres a lot of room for improvement
5188296 i felt a little more comfortable going from the stretch less moving parts its easier to get toward the target and that helped me out
5188297 those first two innings he was out of sync walking the leadoff hitter
5188298 but thats what you like about the kid he adjusted he did his job
5188299 i didnt feel it at all nothing nagging at all
5188300 the last thing you want to do is give up somebody elses runs
5188301 giving up my runs i really dont care as long as i get the save but its not as satisfying to save the game if you give up someone elses runs
5188302 when he throws an 83 mph slider its tough to get locked into the zone
5188303 hell throw a curveball for a strike then bounce one in the dirt then throw a change up down
5188304 having won the 2007 presidential awards for child friendly municipality regional search 1st to 3rd class
5188305 we remain very optimistic about the growth prospects for michael page

5188308 its the start of a change in tactics in dealing with crowd control and dispersing violent demonstrations and violent instances
5188309 it protects the protestors because it doesnt require us to use tear gas and rubber bullets
5188310 they use all kinds of violence against us but we have to get our land back we are willing to sacrifice ourselves
5188311 anyone who wants to can live in this country the problem for us is that they took our land
5188312 its not a chemical it is a smelling liquid it doesnt cause any harm or any physical damage whatsoever even if it gets in peoples eyes
5188313 this is the first time they use this water it is going to make everyone sick
5188314 i saw one boy who couldnt breathe and a lot of other people were throwing up
5188315 un n mero equivocado est en el origen de este libro un hombre lo llam por tel fono una noche preguntando por la agencia de detectives pinkerton el novelista le dijo que se hab a equivocado llamada y respuesta se repitieron la noche siguiente y el narrador nato que es paul auster se plante qu habr a sucedido si hubiera fingido que en efecto l era un detective y un equ voco conduce a otro y sibilinamente se pone en marcha el audaz mecanismo que mueve esta historia en la que lo irreal va horadando lo real y el novelista ejerce de cazador de coincidencias de traductor de las siempre oscuras revelaciones del azar
5188316 from 50 metres out i saw i had the race won i was kind of glimpsing
5188317 i wouldnt say it feels like its freshman year because i was at safety last spring
5188318 when i moved to safety it kind of felt like my freshman year again being on a whole new side of the ball and having a totally different mentality than offense switching to corner didnt really change my mentality ive had to pick up a little bit different scheme but it wasnt that hard to do
5188319 every day that we add something new scheme wise hes in there applying it not only in the classroom but on the field hes doing a very good job
5188320 they let me know theyve got a lot of confidence in me
5188321 they know im smart i can pick it up theyve got a lot of confidence in my abilities that means a lot to me that makes me work harder even though i didnt know the position thats giving me a lot more confidence knowing that they believe in me
5188322 i like to play up more so i can press and be more physical
5188323 i dont like playing off and just sitting and watching i try to use my size to my advantage and my quickness and my size to cover
5188324 youve got to be a lot better on your footwork and youve got to cover a lot different
5188325 its a lot more man to man rather than zone ive been picking it up pretty good
5188326 youve got to know how to break down youve got to know where to be to put yourself in position to make a tackle the angles youve got to take special teams helps a lot with at least the tackling part of moving to defense
5188327 with it comes an incredible responsibility to treat employees well and have competitive wages and benefits
5188328 thats a strong indicator that this is a good place to work
5188329 let me repeat liu xiang will not withdraw unless the pain is unbearable
5188330 after liu xiangs injury i wont bother coming back to the birds nest for more
5188331 when you see the crowd you realize why he had to come out
5188332 his takeoff foot so there is a lot of stress on that area
5188333 in watching warmups we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5188334 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5188335 and will encourage him to come back to the track
5188336 but they will understand when somebody has an accident you cant help it
5188337 the track is perfect anything is possible in the final
5188338 well you can read a paperback just as easily right
5188339 we never said it was hardcover amazons description said it was hardcover so we wont refund your money
5188340 i have worked with kathy for more than 10 years and this is a role that she has prepared for worked hard for and that is well deserved

5188342 you can talk to me if you help me carry my groceries to the car
5188343 absolutely he says as we walk through the parking lot he has lots to tell me about climate change the deforestation of ancient forests sustainable energy and why this is the preeminent concern of our time
5188344 well if we start talking population control then well end up like china with their one child policy
5188345 no i come from a catholic background so i know all about big families
5188346 im an atheist but dont let that besmirch the reputation of greenpeace
5188347 in fact i think its sad that more christians havent been more pro active in their stewardship of the earth
5188348 and you know greenpeace was actually founded by christians i mean i value all life from the little squirrel to the little child
5188349 its is interesting that you believe in the sanctity of all life
5188350 kindness has converted more sinners than zeal eloquence or learning
5188351 if we were doing any deal like that then we would have appointed outside advisers
5188352 you always look at acquisitions and its about how compelling the acquisition opportunity is certainly we would look at all opportunities we have done that in the past and we will continue to do so in the future
5188353 if you look at projected rates of acidity for the year 2100 we are finding a 25 percent reduction in fertilization
5188354 we were completely surprised because people had been looking at the effect of acidification on calcified structures of marine animals but there was no evidence to suggest it was affecting non calcified structures like a sperm or an egg
5188355 it is widely believed that seawater is chemically well buffered but these results show that the acidification process already well underway may threaten the viability of many marine species
5188356 the paper has looked at the projected rates within the next 80 years but we have actually looked at higher acidification values and we have had mortality of the animals
5188357 what we have now is evidence that the worlds marine life is far more sensitive to ocean acidification than first suspected and that means our oceans may be very different places in the not too distant future
5188358 the only proper tribute to omaghs dead ten years on must be that full cross border public inquiry
5188359 we call on public figures to back our call otherwise the system continues to fail everyone and should hold its head in shame

5188362 londoners have so far been largely insulated from the price falls taking place elsewhere in the country
5188363 however sellers who choose to come to the market during the peak holiday season generally have a greater need to sell and as a result properties coming onto the market in july were on average 21 000 cheaper than last month
5188364 areas that are about to benefit from improved transport links appear to be avoiding the worst of the storm that is setting in elsewhere in the capital

5188374 forgive me father for i have sinned its been quite a few months since my last confession
5188375 well it all started on monday last when my neighbour got one of them leather sofas delivered from sofaworld
5188376 the ones that are 40 off with no interest and no payments until next year
5188377 the very ones ive been promising the wife new furniture like forever but i have to confess i was dead envious when i seen thon it looked that squashy and comfortable so it did
5188378 maybe not but its dangerous enough if you steal from the wifes purse to do it
5188379 but i won though and then i won again father and then i got greedy
5188380 and i put an accumulator on the dogs with a tip or two from auld jim hussler
5188381 so i went and bought one of them fancy sofas and replaced the money i took from the wifes purse
5188382 only shed already missed it and she gave me a hard time all day wednesday nag nag nag even though i slipped her enough for a new bag and shoes she never let up all day the top and bottom is father she got me that angry i slapped her one
5188383 oh this is looking very bad and did you make up after
5188384 no shes away an left me gone to her mothers and then on thursday they delivered the new sofa and shes not even there to see it
5188385 so you went and got her back then did you

5188423 es una decisi n que le corresponde exclusivamente a la presidenta
5188424 mire el consumo de paco coca na o marihuana est despenalizado de hecho
5188425 yo le aseguro que no hay un solo procesado por consumo en todo el distrito las causas se archivan
5188426 supongamos por un momento que la polic a me trae un consumidor de dos gramos de coca na o de un porro de marihuana relata ahora un fiscal de san mart n me pregunto lo dejo detenido una noche le tomo declaraci n al d a siguiente la respuesta es no porque le hago perder el trabajo si lo tiene y eso es mucho peor voy a tener una persona que ya tiene un problema que consume droga al que le agrego un problema todav a m s grande que pase a no tener trabajo
5188427 viene el polic a y dice este se or estuvo consumiendo coca na le aplicamos el reactivo al polvo y dio de color azul lo que demuestra que es coca na sin embargo para el expediente ese an lisis no basta se necesita una pericia con control de las partes o sea que el imputado tiene que designar un perito por una dosis o por un porro para que se determine si es cannabis o no igual el turno para hacer esa pericia lo dan m s o menos para dentro de tres meses
5188428 toda la noci n es un desprop sito porque la ley a uno lo pone en la disyuntiva de procesar u obligar a la rehabilitaci n pero la realidad es que procesar no se procesa a nadie entonces se env a en los poqu simos casos en que se detiene a alguien por consumidor a un cpa centro de prevenci n de las adicciones empieza ah el tratamiento pero en buena parte de los casos lo abandona entonces se lo intima a que lo retome cosa que ocurre muy pocas veces se lo vuelve a intimar pero lo cierto es que nunca se lo procesa
5188429 es que desde el punto de vista legal tambi n el procesamiento tiene mucha doctrina en contra afirma el fiscal de san mart n que las acciones privadas de los hombres no son penalmente judiciables que el polic a detuvo por estado de sospecha y eso es inconstitucional por uno u otro argumento la causa se caer a por lo tanto no pasa nada la despenalizaci n es un hecho
5188430 los procedimientos que se hacen coinciden los fiscales son casi por obligaci n una se ora que llama al 911 y dice delante de mi casa hay unos j venes fumando marihuana obligan al patrullero a ir al lugar y llevarse detenidos a los j venes pero tanto los polic as como los fiscales saben que la causa terminar archivada
5188431 en un lugar como budge por ejemplo usted tiene que contar que puede haber diez personas vendiendo en dos manzanas ojo son casi indigentes no es para nada el perfil del gran narco ni siquiera de uno mediano es m s estoy seguro que lo proveen m s de una vez por d a porque los secuestros de paco por ejemplo son de cantidades relativamente chicas dir a que un promedio que var a entre 75 y 200 dosis de paco que es muy poco si se considera que un adicto puede consumir numerosas dosis en un solo d a

5188725 in the short term we expect prices to remain high relative to historical levels albeit with higher volatility
5188726 this has led to overestimation of the supply side response and thus price outcomes regularly being underestimated by industry observers
5188727 longer term demand for our commodities is expected to remain strong we expect that higher long run raw materials and energy prices and stronger producer currencies should place upward pressure on industry supply costs and hence prices of minerals commodities

5188775 this years report card shines a harsh and frankly unflattering light on the attitudes we canadians have concerning mental health
5188776 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination
5188777 can you imagine the public uproar if mental health was replaced with race gender or religion
5188778 these figures show clearly the insidious stigma still associated with mental health and mental illness
5188779 these are the attitudes that have kept mental health on the outside for far too long
5188780 these findings indicate that the worrying trend of have and have not patients continues
5188781 ensuring canadians have access to a family physician is a key area for action

5188786 knoxs first doctrinal work a vindication of the doctrine that the sacrifice of the mass is idolatry follows calvin quite closely in content as well as citations whole dicta from the institutes are such clear evidence that one can even prove to a great extent which edition he used and in which language it was written
5188787 we dissent not from the judgement of the reverend servant of christ jesus john calvin i will faithfully recite his words and sentences in this behalf written thus in his christian institutions
5188788 from beginning to end it on predestination is written in highly controversial language with little thetical positive exposition since the subject is brought back to the antithetical conflict each time how different knoxs work may not perhaps have been had he been instructed to choose his scheme himself
5188789 with this it is clear that for calvin there are really not two covenants but two administrations of one and the same covenant of mercy
5188790 exhibiting only the image of truth while the reality was absent the shadow of the substance
5188791 it becomes clearly apparent over and over again both from his institutes and in particular from his commentaries on the scriptures in which he refers repeatedly to in the institutes that in his view covenant and election do not coincide
5188792 that there is a general vocation by which the world by some manner of means is called to the knowledge of god and a vocation of purpose which appertaineth to gods children only i find in scriptures
5188793 knox just like calvin never contended that the baptism is a sign and seal of the election but of the promise of the gospel and if the promise of the gospel and not individual election is the basis of the covenant the concept of the church must also necessarily be determined thereby
5188794 objective historical analysis is still one of the most difficult tasks of the researcher

5188813 i think yeah we get the most attention every 4 years
5188814 thats probably the first question i have no answer to
5188815 the talent that i have the drive that i have the want to succeed the excitement about the sport im fortunate to have every quality that i have and i wouldnt trade it in
5188816 and over the past years i havent seen him change
5188817 you cant put it in words the level of achievement that he has done here is phenomenal and in my opinion well never ever see it again i just dont think that can ever be emulated or beaten in an age where the sport is so competitive and so close
5188818 he made the pressure putt in the u s open he won the tour de france and he knocked out the best fighter in the world in the 16th round with an uppercut he did absolutely everything sport is supposed to be and he did it with a smile on his face
5188819 my hope is that kids beat a path to their local pools
5188820 ive heard about ravens stadium in his hometown of baltimore watching the finals of the 400 medley relay finals live
5188821 thats 70 000 people at the reds game they watched the 100 fly live there was an announcement at yankee stadium ive heard people back home say its crazy theyre out to eat the tv is on and swimming is on
5188822 we do need a lot of help but every nonprofit organization does
5188823 whatever ive got in my career now i would have had a great deal more if id played in los angeles or chicago you name a town somewhere they were just grateful to have me around
5188824 ellen and portia came out and posed for pictures with ellens mom and their two dogs
5188825 ellen was helping portia with the train of her dress which looked like a cinderella tutu

5188831 i dont waste peoples time im sorry that the storys not interesting
5188832 but its about time that somebody stands up for that girl and i think shes great
5188833 the revisions of our concepts and theories that imagining a solution will eventually require are likely to be very deep and very unsettling
5188834 is that a cool thing to say this day in age that you love your country and you are fighting for the red white blue and it seems like that is a day gone by
5188835 logic will get you from a to b but imagination will take you everywhere
5188836 unless you change how you teach and how kids work new technology is not really going to make a difference
5188837 theres a lot of ownership by the kids in their work instead of teachers lecturing and being the givers of all knowledge
5188838 the classes are just much more alive they dont sleep in class

5188847 once upon a time test match special was part of a great tradition of bbc radio
5188848 but they are bringing in commentators with little knowledge of the game especially of the cadences of test match cricket
5188849 they must sit there with reference books on their laps they just dont know enough about the game
5188850 some of the one day internationals have been perfectly dreadful very much b team
5188851 they are coming from the shop floor of the sports room we need two or three really top flight commentators tat is all that test match special needs to get by they have got to be the best
5188852 ive noticed with a slightly wry smile that the new commentators tend to make cross references with football which you cant imagine happening in the past i know how much agnew hates football

5188861 the ministry believes a more open atmosphere to discuss issues is good to expand the thinking of malaysians in facing the challenges of globalisation

5188874 this legislation represents a real threat to the vibrancy of that online environment
5188875 the activity online proves that a broad range of stakeholders with varying interests and vantage points care deeply about this issue
5188876 there are so many canadians who have issues will this bill
5188877 and the online forum has helped us get informed which leads to offline rallies after we meet members write about what we learned post videos back on to the blogs and facebook
5188878 when you get tens of thousands of canadians speaking out like this theres big political risk for any political party that chooses to ignore them
5188879 it could be a recycled pager it could be a number of things were just going to look at why someone else would have that number and why they would be paged by us

5188909 you can have the nations what i want is the worship that belongs to god

5188924 will in any case be reviewed because nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffers statement that russia used disproportionate force to protect its citizens that we acted beyond the limits of self defence is utterly intolerable
5188925 these are not credible allegations especially coming from the head of an organisation like nato which has itself used not just disproportionate force but force against civilian targets and the civilian population especially in its conflict with yugoslavia in 1999 mr rogozin added

5188936 thats the way i approach things i try to answer everything truthfully i try to answer everything as directly as i possibly can i call things as i see them

5188947 im always pleased when a new race track turns up in the calendar and im particularly keen to experience valencia
5188948 early this year i spent a few days in valencia with my family between the rollout and the next test we had a great time went to the beach and in town theres a dried out riverbed that has nature parks and playgrounds that was very nice especially for the children valencia is also a great place for shopping and eating out needless to say and i love the contrast between its historic and futuristic architecture im looking forward to the weekend
5188949 i am very much looking forward to valencia as i am a big fan of street circuits in general
5188950 on a street circuit it is of major importance to have a good basic set up which is easy to drive the lap time improvement has to be gained step by step you cannot drive in too wild a style also in terms of the racing line you have to approach this gradually it is very important to walk the track before driving it the first time to get a feeling for the surface and the layout
5188951 we are very much looking forward to the race and the city particularly as bmw has some close associations with valencia the formula bmw racing centre there serves as the training site for our up and coming young talent in the formula bmw series around the world valencia is by tradition the venue for rolling out our new f1 car and beyond that city races always make for a unique atmosphere we await the new circuit with keen anticipation
5188952 valencia is a new venue in the calendar and as such poses a particular challenge not least because its a street circuit not that its a slow one the drivers will be exceeding the 300 km h mark on the fastest section with the help of our simulation programs we are in a position to reliably calculate the required downforce levels in advance as well as brake wear and gear ratios that means we will start out with a good basic set up if you compare valencia with monaco youre talking about two street circuits but with very distinctive characters and very different challenges for the cars in valencia we will be racing with a lot of downforce but not with the maximum that monaco demands
5188953 my first thoughts are that its a circuit that we havent raced at before and its got barriers all around it i think the whole of formula one is very excited about going to valencia its a beautiful city and it will be great to be racing around the streets there we have a simulator at our uk base as do most teams and spending a lot of time on that has been vital in terms of learning the circuit with a simulator youre not getting the complete feeling of the car but you are gaining understanding of the distances and the braking points so its very useful we have some very fast circuits like monza spa and silverstone on the calendar and then the slower circuits like monaco and hungary and were expecting valencia to be somewhere in the middle its also got the added excitement of being surrounded by barriers which really focuses your mind and demands that you give full concentration around every single lap
5188954 the challenge of learning a new circuit is always exciting particularly when it is an unusual venue such as the new street circuit in valencia despite preparing as much as we can in advance of the race our track walk with the engineers on thursday and the practice sessions on friday will be absolutely key to learning the track and assessing the grip levels a new track always opens up the field and gives an opportunity for the driver to make an impact as our feedback will be very important in achieving the correct set up we have prepared well and i am looking forward to the weekend and the potential to score some points we can expect the race weekend to be very hot which will add to the physical challenge for the drivers car and team im a big fan of valencia as a city its a beautiful location and hopefully the race will bring a lot of new fans to formula one
5188955 valencia is often thought of as a temporary race venue however it is actually a permanent street circuit which is quite fast and flowing its not like the type of street circuit that we have been used to racing around in monaco
5188956 valencia is going to be a medium to low downforce track with a couple of quick corners which will present a very challenging circuit in an exciting environment one of the key aspects is that it is going to be very windy the americas cup is held in valencia for this very reason however such conditions could make achieving a good balance on the cars quite tricky the valencia weekend is going to be a fascinating engineering challenge for the team and we are all looking forward to it
5188957 it looks pretty fast to be honest you get used to street circuits being quite slow with lots of slow to medium speed corners and very short straights but this is almost the opposite there are a lot of fast kinks and esses a couple of decent straights and lots of high speed stuff its too early to say yet whether there will be opportunities to overtake around here but there are a couple of hairpins where it might be possible
5188958 we launched the vodafone mclaren mercedes team in valencia at the start of 2007 and ive tested at the ricardo tormo circuit so the city isnt unfamiliar to me anyway going to a new circuit doesnt really change my preparations everybodys in the same situation so i dont treat things very differently of course weve done some preparation back at the mclaren technology centre ahead of this race but our main focus will still be the three free practice sessions ahead of qualifying ill be working closely with my engineers to make sure we start the weekend with a good baseline and work hard to strengthen it as we go through the weekend i enjoy visiting new racetracks and im looking forward to getting into the cockpit on friday morning it looks like being an amazing track
5188959 in terms of car set up we need to remember that like monaco the track will be both green and dusty on the opening day of practice
5188960 the most important thing is to be thorough methodical and iterative although we arrive at a new racetrack having undertaken a huge amount of research and armed with an enormous amount of data the reality is that its really only the starting point for our engineering team we begin friday practice the way we would at any other circuit but in this instance we need to pay particular attention both to driver feedback and the data generated from the car the important thing is not to react too hastily its vital that you dont end up going down the wrong path because you only have a limited amount of time to tune the set up before qualifying
5188961 when you think about temporary street races in formula one you mainly think about monaco

5188983 russia wont leave georgia for weeks and it will never withdraw from abkhazia and south ossetia
5188984 they will create every kind of diplomatic language to stay there
5188985 there is no such notion any more in georgia as russian peacekeepers there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces

5189009 jerry wexler was a true music making pioneer whose work at atlantic records created an amazing legacy of r amp b pop and rock
5189010 his life and work have left an indelible mark on the music industry a three time grammy winner who helped shape the careers of iconic r amp b legends ray charles and our 2008 musicares person of the year aretha franklin among others wexlers contributions to our music culture have been immense and immeasurable our deepest sympathies go out to his family friends and all who were moved by his work
5189011 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
5189012 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
5189013 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
5189014 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
5189015 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet
5189016 the frustration and delay the dhbs have imposed on this process will no longer be tolerated by junior doctors it is time for the dhbs to prioritise this negotiation
5189017 their new position still equates to over 7 percent a year which is unaffordable and well beyond other settlements in the health sector
5189018 what message would that send to the other 57 000 employees and unions who have worked with dhbs to agree cooperative and forward looking settlements and partnership agreements
5189019 we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident
5189020 friends of many faiths and traditions will join the family to pay tribute to the music legend and reflect upon his life through speeches musical performances photos and video clips
5189021 there was no pushing there was no slugging there was no swinging of arms there was no tussle nothing like that
5189022 her personal security travis was driving lisaraye was in the back seat i was in the passenger side of the jeep
5189023 we pulled up to her home we had been to the grocery store shed bought food to make tacos so we had groceries in the back of the car
5189024 we got up to the house the guards spoke to her and then proceeded to pick up the phone lisaraye said oh you dont have to pick up the phone to announce me but he proceeded to do so and closed the door to the guard shack with lisaraye standing there he caught her between the door and him her security travis then got out of the car and pulled the door so the guard would not hurt her
5189025 travis never touched the security guard at all lisaraye then walked through the guard house into the property of her home travis was behind her and i was sitting in the truck on the passenger side i then got behind the drivers seat and backed the truck up
5189026 but what ive been told by lisaraye and travis is that there was no belligerence
5189027 when they arrived michael was having a meeting with some of his ministers on the patio
5189028 i was told lisaraye came in she waved two of the people on the patio saw her but she didnt see michael michael then all of a sudden appeared and started walking up the walk toward the house
5189029 lisaraye was walking toward their library study and michael said you should not be here what are you doing here she said what are you talking about michael this is my home they went into the library and one of michaels security guards grabbed first ladys hand and snatched a recorder she had in her hand
5189030 pushed lisaraye and her guard out the front door of the house
5189031 she was treated and then after her treatment she went to the police department and we filed an initial complaint she was there for 6 hours
5189032 the original reason we came and were meeting with michael at michaels request is to come up with a settlement as far as temporary support until there is a decree and finally divorce jeter told us
5189033 so just like any woman from the states if you separate then theres spousal support until you get a final decree and then the final decree determines what the terms of the divorce will be whether theres property settlement or whatever it may be
5189034 its work that no one sees or cares about until theres a problem
5189035 the city is spending a lot of time and effort on something thats below the ground and you only notice it when it doesnt work
5189036 several maps that had been kind of cobbled together over the years
5189037 we wanted to have an electronic mapping system so we could eventually color code all the different types of pipe ages of pipe size of pipe and all that
5189038 rather than cutting off a valve to isolate one section of town it came to be that we had to cut off water to an entire half of the city
5189039 in the future when we have leaks and when were replacing lines we can shut off very small parts of the city and people will see less disruption of service
5189040 were relying on the fire department to bring in a pump truck or a tanker truck for fire service
5189041 when the housing market fell out that 910 000 fell out with it
5189042 this one is for all the palestinian women in israeli jails
5189043 is used for this retrieval 150 images are displayed now
5189044 tanggal 4 dan 9 nanti saya akan ada di jakarta tanggal 9 saya akan menghadiri konser ramadhan erwin gutawa di jcc konser itu saya yang mendanai
5189045 zac is thinking in the 8 million to 10 million range but it depends on how the movie opens and how desperately they want him back
5189046 one of the awards staff asked zac who the straighteners were for and he said vanessa hudgens but it was really for him
5189047 he said the humidity was killing his hair and that it was flat
5189048 then all of a sudden you think im a singer and yes im a songwriter and yes i perform but what else is in my life
5189049 you have to numb yourself because you are away so long it can change you and that is not the type of person i want to be people always want something from you you become like a ghost of yourself or of the person you could be
5189050 losing her made me realise how close i came to the edge it took a while before i could even say the word grandmother because i was so upset
5189051 if i go to see a horror movie you wouldnt hear giggles you would hear the gasps
5189052 i remember i was with my daughter at finding nemo which is a childrens cartoon and suddenly this shark comes up trying to eat the fish
5189053 kiefer who can soon be seen in horror film mirrors also revealed the things that scare him the most
5189054 the stuff that concerns my family like something happening to my mom and my dad or to my daughter being 3 000 miles away doing a film when someone gets sick those are the things that i think scare me the most
5189055 they were both hugging and kissing and looked ecstatic they were both laughing and walked all over the lawn together holding hands and posing the whole afternoon seemed light hearted
5189056 i never would have thought my life would have turned out this way to have money or to have a gorgeous girlfriend i just feel so lucky with everything in my life right now
5189057 i teased him too though especially for having been a model
5189058 making the film did kind of take me back because at a girls school you have your cliques and when new girls come in you are a bit judgemental
5189059 i was in detention a lot because i violated the dress code
5189060 the thing is that theyre both so stupidly beautiful and good looking and attractive that their children are born looking gorgeous its unsettling
5189061 i think their adoption policy is probably better because when their genes come together it creates a storm of attractiveness so potent that it could one day bring down the planet
5189062 that first one they had she had sort of a marilyn monroe mouth
5189063 ive always had a sense of humour but people havent always shared it
5189064 i guess i was in denial i dont understand exactly what it is the symptoms seem to apply to everyone around me in the industry loss of memory starting something and not finishing it
5189065 jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met
5189066 but people have different chemistry they have different lives its not about years its about going out with somebody being truthful on the way in being truthful in the middle and being truthful on the way out youre either a cheater or you break up and im not the first im the second and thats it theres no lying theres no bulls t
5189067 i guarantee you theres 20 per cent of the people on the street right now who are in a relationship they wish they could get out of but they dont know how
5189068 im sorry that the storys not interesting but its about time that somebody stands up for that girl and i think shes great
5189069 it feels good to be back in the lab with brandy again
5189070 weve always made great records and im humbled and honored to be continuing our legacy
5189071 the albums title is a real life mirror of brandy as a woman an artist a musician and a performer communicating what it means to be fully human strong yet vulnerable candid and triumphant in love with life and in touch with the things of the spirit
5189072 a well known lifelong liberal activist and supporter of democratic candidates and use of his song and his voice in a commercial bashing barack obama is anathema to jackson
5189073 i mean its just one point there is an umpire if im 100 percent sure about it i mean i will give it but im not sure
5189074 but both the bbc and capita are absolutely committed to addressing these and we have a big programme in place to change and simplify our processes taking out duplication and overlap
5189075 both staff and the union preferred it when hr was done in house as you could build relationships with the hr team
5189076 will continue to do work with them and support their networks
5189077 i remember him telling me back in the day that if you wanted to know real estate youve got to hang out with real estate investors if you wanted to know sports youve got to hang out with athletes i wanted to know tv so i hung out with bob and learned the tv game from one of the best in the business
5189078 i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network that provides a new brand of superior programming that caters to all aspects of television from reality to original programming
5189079 whoever is elected president will have the power to fundamentally transform the future of abortion politics
5189080 if he selects tom ridge hes going to inflict a mortal wound on his campaign
5189081 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5189082 one of the things that ive always said is that on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception then and you are consistent in that belief then i cant argue with you on that because that is a core issue of faith for you
5189083 what i can do is say are there ways that we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5189084 look at the candidate and say does he live with integrity service with humility share with generosity or not
5189085 they were very different in personality in philosophy in direction in goals and in vision and theres nothing wrong with that
5189086 it was a powerful forum in that we were exposed to the soul of who these two men were
5189087 before this i only got what pundits wanted us to hear issues of character issues of value you dont usually hear those types of things
5189088 it gave us a chance to compare and contrast how they could handle things in different situations
5189089 i could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says i dont need god
5189090 theyre saying im totally self sufficient by myself and nobody is self sufficient to be president by themselves its too big a job
5189091 campaign 2008 is starting to feel like a sunday school bible drill
5189092 i dont see what good it will do for the american people to again hear the candidates spout pious platitudes about their favorite bible verses or how devout they are
5189093 why should one of these important events be orchestrated entirely by only one pastor who comes out of one narrow segment of our diverse country
5189094 a lot of people misjudged our motives and why we were trying to do this as a church and how we were doing it
5189095 afterward so many did say that this has the potential to change the climate of the election
5189096 it was good to have that kind of civil discourse with the candidates
5189097 it was a courageous step for rick warren that he stepped out and asked questions that represented us
5189098 he solidified for me what i thought he was about
5189099 this auction is a wonderful chance for people not only to bid on once in a lifetime opportunities but to also help save a childs life in sierra leone

5189103 who should be on the wall at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in november
5189104 the race between mccain and obama has been so zealous and the coverage so intense fathead just had to throw ourselves into the fray
5189105 our fathead nation is so passionate about sports and entertainment we just knew they would want one of the presidential candidate images
5189106 there was no pushing there was no slugging there was no swinging of arms there was no tussle nothing like that
5189107 her personal security travis was driving lisaraye was in the back seat i was in the passenger side of the jeep
5189108 we pulled up to her home we had been to the grocery store shed bought food to make tacos so we had groceries in the back of the car
5189109 we got up to the house the guards spoke to her and then proceeded to pick up the phone lisaraye said oh you dont have to pick up the phone to announce me but he proceeded to do so and closed the door to the guard shack with lisaraye standing there he caught her between the door and him her security travis then got out of the car and pulled the door so the guard would not hurt her

5189111 but what ive been told by lisaraye and travis is that there was no belligerence

5189121 i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network that provides a new brand of superior programming that caters to all aspects of television from reality to original programming
5189122 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting one in the first place
5189123 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago
5189124 so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away
5189125 secretive about her assets particularly with respect to certain properties owned or titled in either her name alone or in other entities
5189126 correct accounting of all money funds stocks bonds and other securities including bearer securities
5189127 the kids and i kind of learned about the divorce at the same time so that was hard that was probably the worst part of the whole thing was being able to deal with how hurt the whole kids were
5189128 i get the complaint of oh i wish i could see that
5189129 there was nowhere i could find that was just safe where maybe a slip of the finger would take us somewhere where i dont want the kids to see or hear
5189130 friends of many faiths and traditions will join the family to pay tribute to the music legend and reflect upon his life through speeches musical performances photos and video clips
5189131 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
5189132 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
5189133 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
5189134 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
5189135 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet
5189136 we take for granted the basic necessities for some families its a serious struggle
5189137 this is one way to ease the financial burden and help new babies have a good start in life we are only working with companies and products that joel and i would use were checking every product out for safety and all products are bpa free
5189138 nicole saw that even a clean blanket was out of reach for some of these new moms so she wanted to figure out an efficient way to connect them with companies and individuals who want to help
5189139 jerry was one of the last great and real record men of the boomer age and prior to who represented himself with real class and integrity
5189140 he was particularly a very conscientious producer who knew how to mix fun with business he was real and i valued that highly i spoke with him a few months ago and he said that he was not feeling very well but his voice and spirit were still very strong and in tact god bless him for the huge contribution he made to my career and i will remember his tender loving care

5189144 it feels good to be back in the lab with brandy again
5189145 weve always made great records and im humbled and honored to be continuing our legacy the sound might be new bigger and more uplifting but weve kept our musical promise by making great songs and great music once again there is no musical combination like ours
5189146 the albums title is a real life mirror of brandy as a woman an artist a musician and a performer communicating what it means to be fully human strong yet vulnerable candid and triumphant in love with life and in touch with the things of the spirit
5189147 i mean its just one point there is an umpire if im 100 percent sure about it i mean i will give it but im not sure

5189149 the exposure of an intimate part or parts of the body due to a defect in an article
5189150 madonna has not made an attempt to adopt this baby earlier this year or now
5189151 body man in less than two years e 60 cameras and correspondent rachel nichols get an all access pass and multiple interviews with love and obama on the campaign trail to tell of loves position and the bond thats formed between him and the illinois senator
5189152 who should be on the wall at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in november
5189153 the race between mccain and obama has been so zealous and the coverage so intense fathead just had to throw ourselves into the fray
5189154 our fathead nation is so passionate about sports and entertainment we just knew they would want one of the presidential candidate images
5189155 does the position allow for some flexibility in the actual time of day the work must be done
5189156 the most stable unit in society right now is the family and that is based on a marriage between a man and a woman it has been that way for thousands and thousands of years its the best way to raise kids its that simple
5189157 this amendment would essentially enshrine discrimination into the constitution a perfect example of state sponsored discrimination
5189158 once you start that game why is it two people why cant it be more people why cant it be animals you destroy the institution
5189159 there is nothing in the california education code that requires schools to teach anything about marriage at all
5189160 actually i dont think they should have a position on it
5189161 parents are responsible for the what when and where of feeding children are responsible for the how much and whether of eating
5189162 i would argue that if you are making more than 250 000 then you are in the top 3 4 percent of this country
5189163 i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
5189164 to be fair to both of them rich is an adjective
5189165 economic science is not going to tell you that this is the cutoff point
5189166 if you set the bar at half a million youre talking about the top 1 of taxpayers if you think about the last eight years those are the folks who have benefited the most
5189167 give me a specific number is it 100 000 dollars is it 50 200
5189168 if you do surveys 95 of people think they are middle class
5189169 this is including people who are objectively quite poor and people who are objectively quite rich
5189170 i guess it says something nice about america that rich people dont want to act like theyre better than anybody else and poor people dont like complaining about how tough it is to pay their bills
5189171 it should come as no surprise that john mccain believes the cutoff for the rich begins at 5 million
5189172 it may explain why his tax plan gives a 600 000 tax cut to the richest 0 1 of earners
5189173 some of the richest people ive known in my life are the most unhappy
5189174 by a home a good job and education and the ability to hand our children a more prosperous and safer world than the one we inherited

5189176 they feel as though the american dream might be slipping away
5189177 thats whats at risk and thats what this election is all about
5189178 represent foreign governments they represent special interests from every corner of industry so this notion that he is somehow fighting for the little guy is just nonsense
5189179 thats not who hes been fighting for hes been fighting for the same folks making out like bandits for years now
5189180 it means that people are going to hesitate a little bit ba rack o bama theyre still getting past that name but its a testament to the american spirit that im even standing before you as the democratic nominee
5189181 youve just got to tell them thats not true hes a christian
5189182 theres nothing wrong with being muslim weve got wonderful muslim americans but the point is dont lie about my religion
5189183 i dont mind hes a muslim if he would just admit hes a muslim
5189184 we cant vote a black person in there theyll think they rule the world
5189185 i think a certain segment of the american population is just ignorant
5189186 were seeing more requirements to headhunt hr directors who worked in the last recession especially for people who have experience in change management
5189187 over the past 10 years boardroom directors have only had experience with the good times so now with an uncertain economic outlook a lot of employers are looking to bolster their boards with financial and hr directors who are used to making redundancies and large scale change management
5189188 its easier to reduce expenses than increase income in a recession and one way is by cutting staff
5189189 i didnt come here to break records i came to win gold medals
5189190 the bottom line is we cannot solve a 15 billion deficit without new revenue
5189191 this budget runs the risk of putting california on the brink of bankruptcy
5189192 it is time for democrats to take their heads out of the sand
5189193 what we get instead of real reform is phony reform pushed by our democratic friends
5189194 will do nothing to help us live within our means
5189195 we believe its very important today because our society is forgetting about the family and in the day and hour we are living in theres not many thats carrying for one another and giving back to one another says reverend anthony moss pastor of north charleston apostolic church

5189210 i think the girls have done a really good job of focusing on the task at hand when were not in the gym its time for family but when were here its our job and we really have to focus if we want to be in the medal rounds
5189211 i know its definitely weighed on me but a lot of the girls have done something special to remember the family and play for wiz and hugh in our own ways i think it still gives us a little bit more fight because we know were playing for something more its an emotional battle
5189212 the greatest part is that we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5189213 every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us were getting to the point where i think we can win at any racetrack we go to
5189214 has been all year hes great at these larger tracks and there are a lot of these in the chase
5189215 theyre so good i would love to be able to play on that team in the spring well see
5189216 sometimes when you mix and match personnel things like that happen
5189217 we have a lot of work to do on offense the next two weeks a lot of work
5189218 me and matt kemp were out there looking at each other when they tied it up saying what the hecks going on its a big emotional swing but youve got to jump right back on it and stay mentally tough in that situation
5189219 weve had to come up big in some situations and when they present themselves dont back down go up there tough it out really grind out that at bat and make the most of it
5189220 were certainly in a good place right now with a lot of confidence
5189221 we expect to win when we come out here i mean its that intensity without being tense which is where you really want to be
5189222 we had some struggles early in the season on the road and we seem to have put that behind us
5189223 now the schedule is kind of in our favor at home so we have to play better at home and take advantage of a lot of the momentum we built up at home earlier in the year we have to reinvigorate ourselves and do it again
5189224 thats all it comes down to i started making pitches after the fact and thats pretty much the whole ballgame
5189225 everything that guy puts wood on is a base hit right now
5189226 when you sit in the front row they zoom past really fast
5189227 she likes watching this but she said she doesnt want to skate
5189228 in four months the first one will turn 18 and transfer into our league
5189229 it was a pretty good finish in the sixth seventh and eighth scoring 13 total runs
5189230 because when i go to the court and the other players know i beat 19 players in a row and nobody can beat me it is good for me
5189231 defense is the most important thing in our quest for a gold medal
5189232 the teams we face from here on out are very skilled on the offensive end and were going to have to be able to get stops when we need them and force a lot of pressure
5189233 i just wanted to make sure i took every single moment in and every single swim in every single moment with my teammates so i would remember them
5189234 to swim in the same era as him has been awesome
5189235 i dont want the world to remember team usa as being failures
5189236 i didnt let family friends down if i was to say i let them down that means i didnt do my best i tried 100 percent i hope they will understand
5189237 we worked hard every day but the result was as you see and its really hard to take
5189238 i dont understand the rules but its exciting to see an olympic event
5189239 there is plenty else to report the logistics are running smoothly the venues are jaw dropping and the chinese team is delivering big time
5189240 this is a games for the local audience and they are having as much fun as you could expect they wont look at it with the same critical eye as a bunch of foreigners
5189241 really achieved the major objective presenting themselves to their country as presenting themselves to the world without actually doing so
5189242 i have not been allowed to visit her and i worry she will not be released after the month is over
5189243 i did say that the olympic games coming to china will help china to open up further and to reform better the fact is after 30 years of reform china has developed greatly
5189244 people enjoy more freedom everybody can see that olympic games is a great platform
5189245 i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years
5189246 as he turned away he turned back and said i thought about it
5189247 we are playing a lot of different players right now
5189248 when you dont play on edge on defense like we have been playing in camp you arent going to be as successful
5189249 our defense didnt come with the enthusiasm and excitement that we had
5189250 im really glad to see what we did because the defense has been getting the best of us and kicking our tails so far
5189251 i like the way we responded but we still have a lot of practices to go before we catch up to those guys
5189252 robby showed what kind of a weapon he can be
5189253 he is a dangerous man in a lot of different situations we have to continue to get him the ball
5189254 he is a fun guy to have on your team
5189255 i think its going to encourage faster play and i think thats good for us we want to play at a faster tempo
5189256 a lot of times with us the umpire would be standing over the ball letting the defense make substitutions and all that and now i dont think that is going to be the case
5189257 people are going to look at his size and think he is not going to fit the bill but hell fill those shoes really well he is going to be everywhere across the field everywhere youll see him on every play
5189258 dont tell coach but we shouldnt have even practiced that day we should have been there all day it was a lot of fun a lot of team bonding offense and defense working together
5189259 that was real fun we were competing as usual offense and defense i think i had more kills than receivers terrell turner and mike thomas combined but its their fault i was trained when i was like 6 i was on the swat team but i decided to just play football

5189263 why should fdr have attended a ceremony created solely to give respectability to nazi germany sports above politics was the sports boycott of south africa which hastened the end of apartheid wrong
5189264 the last touchdown was a check at the line it gave him the leverage we needed and he attacked it it is something he certainly wouldnt have been able to do last year
5189265 it is something that comes along with the offense once you learn this offense more and understand what is happening it is going to be a whole lot easier
5189266 i know what is going on and what to look for and what is expected of me
5189267 i know the guys around me and they know exactly what i want and exactly what i need
5189268 once you learn this offense more and understand what is happening it is going to be a whole lot easier
5189269 to drive away the idle melancholy thoughts that torment me

5189280 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5189281 that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys
5189282 a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5189283 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5189284 the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5189285 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5189286 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5189287 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5189288 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5189289 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5189290 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5189291 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5189292 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous
5189293 i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5189294 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5189295 i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on
5189296 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that its bad for the entire garage i think

5189367 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
5189368 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
5189369 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
5189370 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
5189371 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity
5189372 in france we lost the culture of the bike after the war when it was seen as old fashioned or for poor people
5189373 now its coming back and with the latest increase in gasoline prices we are seeing enormous interest

5189407 we will publish next year details of the work thats been done where we think the particular threats are where we think there is current defence in place
5189408 we will begin to talk with communities where we think defence is not a viable option

5189450 these last couple weeks i spent more time with you than i ever spent with him
5189451 must have been hard on you that doctor dying huh
5189452 i have to ask you if hes the reason why we fought so much while i was away
5189453 he wanted to tell you but he couldnt so im telling you for him if he had to die im happy he died in love
5189454 we got close too close but it was over before you got back
5189455 you and i both know that the worst thing in the field is a soldier worried about problems back home
5189456 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5189457 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5189458 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5189459 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5189460 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5189461 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5189462 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5189463 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5189464 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5189465 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5189466 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5189467 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5189468 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5189469 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5189470 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5189471 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5189472 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5189473 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile
5189474 as far as i know my grandmother never saw doctor who but i am sure she would have been intrigued excited and above all flattered

5189494 he took up residence there before we ever launched into iraq organized the al qaeda operations inside iraq before we even arrived on the scene and then of course led the charge for iraq until we killed him last june

5189500 me and matt kemp were out there looking at each other when they tied it up saying what the hecks going on its a big emotional swing but youve got to jump right back on it and stay mentally tough in that situation
5189501 were certainly in a good place right now with a lot of confidence
5189502 he just made some mistakes early in the game and the guys hit him
5189503 whenever you have a chance to get those pitchers out of the game quick its good to get to their bullpen and work their bullpen

5189505 they spent thursday night and friday morning without their medication
5189506 these children could run the risk of developing drug resistance and that could get worse and mean they are shortening their lives
5189507 treatment should be taken at all times to adequately suppress the virus failure to do so results in drug resistance
5189508 the department is considering packaging chronic medication and sending them to clinics where patients can collect them closer to their residential areas
5189509 the whole decoupling thesis has started to come apart at the seams
5189510 canada is frozen over we have arctic conditions in sweden and the uk is falling off the white cliffs of dover
5189511 the uk housing event is probably second only to the japanese 1990 land bubble in the real estate bubble hall of fame uk house prices could easily decline 50pc from the peak and at that lower level they would still be higher than they were in 1997 as a multiple of income
5189512 if prices go all the way back to trend and history says that is extremely likely then the uk financial system will need some serious bail outs and the global ripples will be substantial

5189515 we are making a great game that harry potter fans will really enjoy we are evaluating the impact of the movie date change
5189516 we remain bitterly disappointed at the manner in which sonny bill deserted his team mates and his supporters
5189517 we have however reached the point where we need to get on with business and we have withdrawn the injunction against him playing for any other club
5189518 neither the bulldogs nor sonny bill have anything further to gain by drawing this situation out any further
5189519 this is the most difficult issue we are going to face as an agency
5189520 we know the sea is eating away at the coast in quite a number of places primarily but not totally exclusively on the east and south coasts
5189521 its a particularly huge issue in east anglia but in quite a number of other areas as well
5189522 we are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast it would simply be an impossible task both in financial terms and engineering terms
5189523 we will publish next year details of the work thats been done where we think the particular threats are where we think there is current defence in place
5189524 we will begin to talk with communities where we think defence is not a viable option
5189525 i may not have experience in politics but i have a heart to understand a poor mans problems i have the intention to help and guts to bring a change i am more bothered about my peoples livelihood
5189526 a lot of people get lost in the world of computer simulation

5189536 bee is a really terrific candidate for the republicans i dont think they could have gotten a better candidate
5189537 if he had run against giffords last time when the seat was open he might have beaten her
5189538 within the time that the republican brand name nationwide and within arizona is in peril
5189539 youve got to assume at this point in time that giffords is the front runner and has the advantage of incumbency
5189540 we have a very strong organization ive got some of the top leaders and campaign volunteer organizations in the state
5189541 were feeling very good about our position at this time
5189542 we will be seeing the republican national party putting in more
5189543 i take the fact that hes bringing in washington heavyweights to campaign for him as a sign of republicans objective to take this seat away
5189544 the cons of drinking wine or any type of booze nightly are many
5189545 if youre on a fat loss program it can mean the difference between getting great results and getting zero results
5189546 multiply that by seven and you get 700 extra calories per week points out neave
5189547 you cant afford to do this when you are trying to maintain an adequate calorie intake for fat loss
5189548 i was going to the gym every day but i wasnt seeing results
5189549 i thought i could eat and drink whatever i wanted
5189550 what were paying for hay this year is twice as much as it was three or four years ago every time we buy feed its more expensive
5189551 its forced us to raise our lesson prices to cover what its costing us to maintain our lesson horses
5189552 all my animals are family to me so it was very difficult to give him up but the expense of supporting a horse has become such a financial strain for me i needed to do what was best for cheyenne
5189553 i decided to give him away because i wanted him to go to a good home where hed get the best possible care
5189554 families with three or four backyard horses are scaling back on the number of animals theyre willing to support
5189555 food prices for horse owners are absolutely tremendous right now
5189556 the dramatic rise in hay costs has created some serious cash problems for horse owners across the state were experiencing an inflationary market right now and everyone is feeling it
5189557 horse rescues and sanctuaries across the country are literally overflowing right now
5189558 as money issues become more difficult our supporters and donations become more scarce
5189559 we are continuing our fundraisers so we can help as many people as possible
5189560 it actually took the same number of days flying to get there as it did driving
5189561 it took 13 1 2 hours flight time to get there and 14 hours to get back
5189562 she learned how to fly in the civil air patrols cessna 182
5189563 the eaa knew it was getting close to the number and wanted a way to mark the milestone
5189564 it was a big surprise i guess i had the lucky number
5189565 i built it inside the two car garage at our house he said
5189566 at one point after finishing the wings i had to store them in the living room because i needed room in the garage to work on the fuselage
5189567 you can try to build one of these yourself but you really cant you are going to need help along the way
5189568 there are also some special tools specific to the airplane industry you are going to need but they arent too expensive
5189569 i was excited and apprehensive but the plane flew great and performed well
5189570 it is still why im driving my 15 year old saturn
5189571 i remember as a child going out into our backyard and measuring it to see if we had enough room to land an airplane he said
5189572 when i realized we didnt i thought maybe a helicopter would work
5189573 when you sit in the front row they zoom past really fast

5189580 the medications that are available and the medications we are looking at are trying to cure these relapses and the changes that occur on the mri
5189581 if something happens you are immediately seen and they check up on you a lot
5189582 were hoping the eighth floor build out buys us some time
5189583 i dont think theres a firm decision on that yet
5189584 one of the things thats up there for sure is a larger scale courtroom
5189585 there are a variety of options for the future that the court is willing to look at
5189586 if we do it right well get a modern street
5189587 east of scott theres nothing to speak of now on broadway you walk down there and it looks like we tore something down
5189588 theres gotta be so much more that this building can be
5189589 this is a totally new look its to bring a lifestyle that hasnt been here before i call it a cosmopolitan lifestyle the concept is to be able to see out of the building you are in an environment that is part of the outside world
5189590 there has been little to no supply of this type of offering weve had interest from people in boston new york the foothills ive even had a call from a person in dubai the skeptics say downtown is a lost cause its really not its the new frontier
5189591 it wasnt until i got really interested in revitalizing downtown that motivated me to look at these other properties
5189592 i think the public will be pleasantly surprised sooner rather than later i think certain projects such as this one have a very high probability for success because it leans toward redevelopment as opposed to projects that cost hundreds of millions of dollars that downtown is not ready to support
5189593 its definitely a modern refiguring to be more functional and playful
5189594 thats something we currently dont require that restaurants do but its something that has been discussed
5189595 citizens are asking for more and more information about their food and i do believe that as we go forward whatever we have done in the past will not be sufficient
5189596 after the report the county board of supervisors decided it was really time to make substantial changes and doing this was an absolute no brainer
5189597 we wanted the restaurants to have the same incentives we did which is to protect the public and by giving grades and requiring them to display them we aligned those incentives
5189598 safer food facilities reduced incidents of foodborne illness improved information for consumers and enthusiastic support for the grading program
5189599 honestly if we had more dollars to invest i would much prefer that we use them to further the recognition of performing restaurants were using the carrot rather than the stick
5189600 if i walk into a restaurant and dont see the proof that theyre performing they must not be making it
5189601 in a sense our grading system is very similar to what the study recommended
5189602 the committee just thought that the grades we adopted would be more relevant because there is so much context to those letter grades from schools and it was too stigmatizing and inflammatory
5189603 in pittsburgh and washington d c we had to file freedom of information act requests and wait several months to get the reports
5189604 and baltimore only sent 14 of the 30 reports we requested they said they just werent staffed well enough to have the reports sorted in any meaningful way
5189605 in cities where they dont require the posting of grade cards consumers arent really aware of anything short of the closure of the restaurant for health reasons so its kind of the restaurateurs hidden shame
5189606 they can kind of say well maybe well do better next time and maybe we wont i dont think that should be a hidden shame
5189607 we had some challenges but you have to meet the challenges you cant use an old building as an excuse
5189608 for me its something that would be good to have up there for the customer and the employees for the employees that grade is going to be a constant reminder of where they are good or bad and what they need to do
5189609 im in favor of putting it right there in front where everybody can see it
5189610 i lived in l a and i saw how they did things when they decided to clean it up they didnt mess around they closed about 30 restaurants in about 30 days
5189611 we have ethics training we do statistical analysis of inspections to look at things we rotate inspection assignments and areas we also have unannounced inspections by supervisors the day after our inspectors go out
5189612 you can take that to mean that you have the cleanest restaurants or you can take that to mean that you have the most lenient inspectors
5189613 the sample size was small and for the most part the restaurants they chose to study here were ones that had pretty good control systems in place
5189614 it was hypocritical for the government to sell uranium to countries like china and russia which despite being part of the pact use uranium for weapons
5189615 how can we justify selling the uranium to china and to russia in an unfettered way and yet we dont sell uranium to india
5189616 everybody has an obligation to contribute this is not a partisan issue
5189617 if voices like mine are not heard in new delhi i will have no option but to resign from parliament
5189618 mainstream leaders should resign from the parliament and support the separatist movement

5189747 i immediately ran out and bought that cd as well as the sound of white i listened to it a great deal while writing hold tight even mentioning her in the actual book it became something of a backdrop so i told my readers about her in a newsletter the response has been positive
5189748 my mum and aunty were recently in broome in western australia in the same place i wrote most of my last album when my aunty in the middle of reading hold tight stopped suddenly and said
5189749 so of course my mum read it and is a huge fan of harlan cobens now i look forward to reading it myself i really feel honoured to have been mentioned in the writings of such a respected and talented author

5189797 the only language that bullies understand is when someone stands up to them what x has done here is used massive and disproportionate force its breached international law and it has violated ys territorial integrity it has acted as a massive and dangerous bully and we cant allow this to go ahead without it being challenged

5189801 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5189802 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5189803 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5189804 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5189805 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5189806 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5189807 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5189808 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5189809 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5189810 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5189811 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5189812 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5189813 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5189814 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

5189817 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5189818 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5189819 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5189820 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5189821 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5189822 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5189823 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5189824 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5189825 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5189826 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5189827 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5189828 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5189829 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5189830 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5189831 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5189832 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5189833 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5189834 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5189835 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5189836 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5189837 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5189838 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5189839 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5189840 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5189841 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5189842 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5189843 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5189844 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5189845 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5189846 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5189847 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5189848 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5189849 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5189850 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5189851 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5189852 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula

5189992 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental

5189997 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5189998 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
