4860009 do family ties mean being responsible for your extended familys needs

4860014 i dont worry about having a roof over my head

4860017 well if you really love them if it really is forever if love not money is the most important thing
4860018 i dont want to share and i want someone to tell me that is ok
4860019 do i have the obligation to guard it as such
4860020 do i love my future spouse as much as my money
4860021 im just wondering if theres been some sort of error wed been expecting the wedding to cost around whatever you believe it actually cost could you double check the math to be certain theres been no mistake
4860022 this is what we think is reasonable and are happy to contribute make it work
4860023 we probably should have been a little more involved in the planning but this is more than we expected do you think that this is about what it cost
4860024 you thought college was bad wait until you have to pay for two weddings
4860025 we can pay one third of the cost as long as our share doesnt exceed insert dollar limit
4860026 no we wont loan you money pay your mortgage buy you a new car
4860027 sorry we have allocated the money for something else and dont have anything to spare
4860028 hey heather congrats on hubbys raise now how about giving us 10k
4860029 let everyone know exactly who you are by showing them your usb flash drive
4860030 the funeral is the price of admission to hearing the will
4860031 your grandma wants you to come by and get anything you want from her house
4860032 thats not fair you live in the same house why do you each get a share
4860033 after all you guys own a house and have two solid incomes and he has nothing why shouldnt he get what he wants
4860034 for whatever reason grandma wanted me to have these items after she passed away i feel i would be dishonoring her wishes if i did otherwise
4860035 i heard she has a lot of money what is she doing to do with it
4860036 thats family money she just cant give it to you
4860037 thats ridiculous i dont even know these people i have spoken to them in 40 years why in the world would they expect me to give them something
4860038 i am going to leave you everything dont you dare share a nickel with the rest of them you are the only one who did anything with your life and its obvious they dont give a damn about me why should i give a damn about them
4860039 you can never get enough of what you dont need and what you dont need will never satisfy
4860040 on no dear you cant have that that has cousin name on it
4860041 this is not your problem and your cousins are scum for asking hold your head up high that your grandmother loved you and enjoy her presence in your life
4860042 aimed at taking customers from her brother in law and bread off her sisters familys table
4860043 either way though youve shown a remarkable lack of family loyalty in starting a business aimed at taking customers from your brother in law and bread off your sisters familys table any way you slice it thats a hostile act
4860044 dont be surprised if when times are bad the rest of the family does not seem inclined to help you out
4860045 hey it doesnt matter what they give you its the thought that counts
4860046 the entire affair is a monumental farce a sham a fake a public lie and frankly i am overly tired of it
4860047 we are not in the world by ourselves there are millions of species and the majority of us are dependent on one another in one way or another
4860048 well currently i am making x however i am looking to make something closer to y
4860049 dont ever do that again dont ever admit something like that in a job interview
4860050 a person wants to be compensated based on the skills abilities he brings to the
4860051 were going to make you an offer what do you want
4860052 ask for the most the job offers believe me you will sleep better at night having gotten what you want and especially when the work get more difficult or stressful
4860053 some of my compensation was off the books and that is definitely a situation i want to change as i move to a new position
4860054 my salary was actual salary but that is a large part of why i cannot work with that organization anymore i believe desired salary is fair compensation for the quality and quantity of work i do and it would take something between desired salary and absolute minimum tolerable salary to insure loyalty and keen focus from me
4860055 no it is not my companys policy to counteroffer an employee who has been offered a higher salary position elsewhere
4860056 my current salary its xx which as you can see is one of the major reasons i am looking to change positions i have a rough idea of what my colleagues are making and i know i am well below the average in pay and that i am well above average in performance
4860057 oh im going to put no money down my credit should be pretty good and i wont pay more than 750 a month for this 50 000 car
4860058 i had the chance to live the high life and didnt care if i couldnt sell out at the end i had fun while it lasted
4860059 a democracy can only last 50 years or so after the voters realize they can vote themselves money from the public coffers

4860062 uphills both ways in the snow barefoot to school argument
4860063 if you knew he was up to no good why did you allow your daughter to marry him in the first place

4860065 3 years of out college im making well over 95k with a pharm d its the best investment ever and i own a luxurious million dollar house
4860066 can i afford to buy the house for my daughter out right
4860067 3 years of out college im making well over 95k with a pharm d its the best investment ever and i own a luxurious million dollar house
4860068 put the house in your name that way his name isnt on anything
4860069 parents should never help their children out in situations like this
4860070 why does he going out with friends a few times a week make him a bum
4860071 if you dont have the money to get a house you dont need to be trying to buy one
4860072 sorry mom and dad i have this xyz happen so i have to stop paying you for a while now
4860073 since melissa wants to make this large investment with josh that is a decision you must honor
4860074 what if your real estate circumstances are a bit brighter say for instance youre able to swing a vacation home on the lake youre in tax luck mortgage interest on second homes is fully deductible in fact your additional property doesnt have to strictly be a house it could be a boat or rv as long as it has cooking sleeping and bathroom facilities

4860087 so obvious that someone would have caught it before the printing anyway
4860088 n il tempo n il potere della volont cambiano luomo lamore a trasformarlo
4860089 great food lousy service we always tip at least 20 for great service our 1 00 tip indicates our displeasure with the tip
4860090 the us 0 01 sends the appropriate message about the service received and my wife and i do not plan to return
4860091 look at that girl she just cut a hair and put it in her plate
4860092 i saw when you cut a piece of your hair and put it in the plate
4860093 the importance of using the golden rule with everyone we encounter in our daily lives particularly those who provide us with goods and services such as waiters and waitresses
4860094 you know you really do not do yourself a service by trying to sell this fill in the blank
4860095 would you like some fresh ground pepper parmesan on that
4860096 no i think i have enough already i mean its a pepper steak
4860097 i hated it tell the chef to make me another
4860098 excuse me sir can you please bring me another beer whenever you have a chance
4860099 marcus today you have to go to red lobster or mcdonalds even though you are broke and dont like their prices service and food
4860100 im in a great mood and you did a great job thank you
4860101 oh youre doing so good you are up to a nickel already
4860102 the servers deserve their tips as they are paid so poorly
4860103 if the employee is at work they get paid what a concept
4860104 the oft repeated remark that waitpersons are paid less than the federal minimum wage is nonsense read the law employers of persons who customarily receive tips can reduce their pay by the amount of those tips to a minimum of 2 13 hour however if the employee fails to receive enough tips to make the federal minimum wage the employer must make up the difference
4860105 for parties of 8 or whatever or more we have automatically added an 18 or whatever service charge
4860106 it is the easiest job on the planet and a well trained monkey could do it
4860107 insure to get as a certainty to secure as your degree will insure you a job
4860108 you dont earn it you dont get it welcome to the real world
4860109 however if you bring me fries when i ordered a baked potato with my steak that is your fault for not checking the order before you bring it out to me quality control is your responsibility and will affect your tip
4860110 2 when i ask for a bottomless beverage coke or iced tea my glass should never run empty and it should get as much attention as if i had ordered alcohol i should never have to ask for a refill and if i do down goes the tip
4860111 since it seems that this is industry standard if the food i receive is terrible or improperly cooked my bill should be comped accordingly and your tip will not be affected
4860112 when i accepted the position i knew how much i was going to be making and how often i would get reviews raises as did you you chose this line of work you knew what you were going to make when you were offered the job and you do have the ability to greatly supplement that wage from the tips you would receive by providing excellent service if you dont like how the system works find another line of work and quit blaming the customers for your issues financial or otherwise
4860113 my waiter gets paid so why should i be expected to shell out extra
4860114 we left you a tip because of how good you were we dont normally tip because you get paid by the restaurant
4860115 maam i make 2 13 an hour from the restaurant if i dont receive tips i dont make any money
4860116 yes but it doesnt change the fact that tipping is expected in this country that is why the restaurant can legally pay me less than minimum wage
4860117 every state except california and nevada if memory serves waiters waitresses and bartenders are paid less than minimum wage in virginia its usually 2 13 hour because tipping is expected so when a server does their job in an acceptable manner and you dont tip you are in fact depriving them of their just income think of your tip as the price you are paying for not having to perform all of the aforementioned actions yourself just as you pay somebody to mow your lawn because you dont want to mow it yourself that is if you dont mow your own lawn im talking in principle here so you should tip a waiter for bringing you drinks and food so you dont have to do it yourself
4860118 we had two cooks call in sick today so im afraid your meal will take about half an hour to come out
4860119 oh i deign to tip a few crumbs towards the mouths of the little people for being good little people
4860120 i enjoyed the meal and this is my waiters tip
4860121 a person who is nice to you but rude to the waiter is not a nice person
4860122 waitstaff should be paid less than minimum wage because they earn tips stuff
4860123 as a server i know that i may put your order in but contrary to popular belief i dont cook it
4860124 my aim was to come out and win when i saw the time im celebrating im happy
4860125 i didnt come here to run the world record because i was the world record holder i came here to win
4860126 watched some more tv went to my room slept for three hours went back got some more nuggets then came to the track
4860127 im pretty upset when i get back to the village its probably going to set in
4860128 that 72 inch plasma got it bmw got it lotus got it money in the brokerage yep and growing nicely now the best parts free rent free food and prepared too free house cleaning free laundry free utilities free well everything my mom gets to see me everyday and my dad has someone to talk to and go to cubs games with my overall advice is not to leave home if you can unless your situation is unhealthy or intolerable its financially the best deal youll walk away from
4860129 figure out what they want to do with their life
4860130 if you go to a private school to get a degree that you could have gotten at a public university you are an idiot
4860131 if it doesnt work out you can always come home
4860132 i dont intend to start something that i dont intend to finish
4860133 stop getting useless degrees that dont pay anything and trying to live in expensive areas
4860134 you get the ankles ill get her wrists on the count of three out she goes
4860135 i am an adult at 18 type of western mentality
4860136 its not who who wins the sprint but the person who wins the race
4860137 when youre 18 my financial responsibility to you ends if i ever choose to do anything for you after that it will be just that a choice
4860138 this generation x is really scary because they have no ambition or goals they think life is just a big party and they all want to live the lifestyle so they figure live at home rent free food free utlities free and spend it all on useless designer junk that in the long run means nothing all of you need to grow up get a job and earn your own way
4860139 i wish i had a dime for every time i heard a reference to how things will be fine when i you turn 18 and get out of this house what a farce
4860140 you should have slammed her for creating such a monster there is no reason that at 28 she shouldnt be supporting herself
4860141 my son and i share a rental because living in southern california neither of us make enough to live on our own
4860142 no mom not anymore you have to be responsible for your own actions
4860143 poor pitiful me i have to live with mommy because i cant afford a home
4860144 cut her off the last thing we need is another democrat voter
4860145 young people today and their designer purses and ipods etc
4860146 there is no better way for a child to grow up than to join the united states army

4860223 a group of friends from different branches of the arts
4860224 mahmoud was at the centre of arab culture in the 20th century because he was a poet and a palestinian poetry lies at the centre of all arab arts and palestine at the centre of arab collective consciousness a poem about palestine was therefore a poem to all arabs among the many arts that the arabs have produced without interruption over 15 centuries of their history poetry is still the most celebrated arab cultural identity revolves around language the eloquence of the quran was the proof of its divinity the beauty of a line of poetry turned it into a proverb with all the moral authority of law or tradition the role of poetry in creating collective identity among arabs is well known it is no coincidence that the prophet of the arabs was called by some a poet and that three centuries later al mutanabbi the greatest poet in medieval arab history called himself a prophet among the palestinians this passion for poetry is heightened because their collective identity is negated by their enemies and the rulers of the world poetry becomes a means of collective self expression and hence of collective self assertion as such it is safe to say that mahmouds poetry was never dissociated from palestine and the palestinian struggle for freedom however being an arab palestinian poet made him a spokesman for the palestinian and arab struggles for freedom and that in itself was a heavier constraint on his freedom of writing and style mahmouds later poetry was a continuous attempt to break free from the shackle like crown bestowed on him by his people nonetheless in his writing these intentional attempts to make the struggle absent only made it all the more present for one cannot intend to forget without remembering the very thing that one wants to forget

4860909 if saddam rejects peace and we have to use force our purpose is clear we want to seriously diminish the threat posed by iraqs weapons of mass destruction program

4860998 we will be taking an open top bus from the civic centre to the market place and showing the two races on big screens there will be a firework finale and then it will be back to the civic centre for a big party

4861004 the european union has been an expensive disaster for this country ruining swathes of our economy destroying our independence and then having the nerve to charge us for it
4861005 tortilla riots mud cakes and why your food is so expensive by raj patel daily mail article visitors to the shanty towns of haiti the poorest country in the western hemisphere will find something unusual in the markets its a dry yellow round food product about the size of a digestive biscuit theyre mud cakes made from clay salt oil and water eat one and youll keep hunger at bay for a few hours
4861006 the european union has been an expensive disaster for this country ruining swathes of our economy destroying our independence and then having the nerve to charge us for it
4861007 if this happens to me i should like to request that the police officers involved in trying and probably failing to catch the culprits should refrain from making drivelling pronouncements to the media
4861008 you only have power over people as long as you dont take everything from them but when youve robbed a man of everything hes no longer in your power hes free again
4861009 hastiness and superficiality are the psychic diseases of the 20th century and more than anywhere else this disease is reflected in the press
4861010 as for the policeman who said mrs buchanan was lucky well she was in a way but do we really know in what context the policeman said it
4861011 an interesting debate has erupted in the usa about the charming witty film wall e is it left wing propaganda about saving the planet or is it an old fashioned plea for individual love courage and a condemnation of globalist corporate greed
4861012 there is no left and right category that people can be labelled with really
4861013 mr hitchens solznhenitsyn only spent 8 years a prisoner mandela spent 27
4861014 furthermore unpleasant as the soviet system was it was not based on race whereas south africa was a country designed to keep over 80 of the population in subjection
4861015 mandela fought and suffered for all the same freedoms that solzhenitsyn did but for longer and with better results
4861016 and his views are not disfigured by the religious obscurantism and pan slavism that solzhenitsyn later fell into opposing the independence of ukraine for example
4861017 only by being aware of it can we do something about it and i think knife crime reporting works the same way you cant defend against something you are unaware of
4861018 give politicians the chance to deny that crime is spreading
4861019 ridding yourself of folly is but the beginning of wisdom
4861020 so id suggest bombarding people with inspiring stories instead and reporting on crimes only the strictly necessary and never on the front page and that would be a realistic view of the life out there because no matter how much crime there is there are far more decent people around that do good than crimes
4861021 when i read the daily mail and not only i think the whole world is either criminal or negative or full of monsters there are disasters everywhere why should i not think that this is what life is all about that this is what is normal if i were a young fragile mind so either i kill myself or start living the life that is mirrored back to me as being normal crime money drinking war etc etc
4861022 people wouldnt buy papers if it was all good news
4861023 the creed of our democracy is that liberty is acquired and kept by men and women who are strong and self reliant and possessed of such wisdom as god gives mankind men and women who are just and understanding and generous to others men and women who are capable of disciplining themselves for they are the rulers and they must rule themselves
4861024 you need to stop paying attention to the rantings and ravings of the press and try dig up real facts from there you can make your own mind up rather than have it all presented to you on a platter
4861025 if youre really trying to help me understand what left right politics is all about you need to imagine that i am a 7 years old child and then try to make me understand
4861026 for example why exactly is labour and especially new labour categorized as left
4861027 im just not convinced though that not reporting crimes in the first place would mean that people would
4861028 we are more under the thumb of foreign powers than at any time for 300 years we are less free poorer and worse governed disorder and crime are uncontrolled
4861029 consequently immature personalities might come to see no particular reason to seek fame through virtue as was once the accepted norm cutting off the oxygen supply of publicity might i think quench at least some smouldering fires of resentment wanton violence and sheer unregenerate personal wickedness
4861030 it is about people gabriela what we are who we are where we are all going and why
4861031 when we are not children anymore we are already dead
4861032 if adults would see the world through childrens eyes the world would be a much better place
4861033 children see many times much clearer because their minds are innocent and fresh and not full of the garbage that society put into their minds
4861034 no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy family home or correspondence nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks
4861035 children see many times much clearer because their minds are innocent and fresh and not full of the garbage that society put into their minds
4861036 this question of left and right brought up by gabriela to put it in a nutshell the left as we have in government now believe that the individual cannot manage without the almightly state telling them what to do how to live their lives what to think etc which manifests itself in our current nanny state full of politically correct snooping busy bodies spying on us in every possible way in order to interfere and dominate our lives lots of public announcements for our dubious benefit lots of banning things that arent good for us lots of interference the right conservative usually believe that individual freedom is paramount and state intervention obnoxious

4861039 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4861040 but now that president medvedev has reportedly signed the cease fire agreement i assume that russian forces are going to begin to withdraw expeditiously
4861041 i have to assume for now that the word of the president of russia to the presidency of the eu is going to be respected
4861042 its been kind of sad seeing them sit in the weather
4861043 you can fool all of the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time but you can not fool all of the people all of the time
4861044 the only thing we have to fear is fear itself nameless unreasoning unjustified terror
4861045 every gun that is made every warship launched every rocket fired in a final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and are not clothed
4861046 a well regulated militia composed of the body of the people trained in arms is the best most natural defense of a free country
4861047 in this springtime of hope some lights seem eternal americas is
4861048 a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people
4861049 im a great believer in luck and i find the harder i work the more i have of it
4861050 government is not reason it is not eloquent it is force like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master
4861051 those who want the government to regulate matters of the mind and spirit are like men who are so afraid of being murdered that they commit suicide to avoid assassination

4861054 ive just finished coding the new reindeer intranet santa claus asked me to do you know how he likes to appear to be at the cutting edge talking incessantly about web 2 0
4861055 ive managed to keep him happy whilst also keeping it usable accessible and gleaming and im
4861056 the preview appears in english as its hard coded in the javascript
4861057 and theres more you arent displaying large numbers in french properly either
4861058 you just have to think about things in a slightly different way from what youre used to
4861059 the i18n object will also contain our translations which we will access through a function called
4861060 so if a translation is available and provided well use that otherwise well default to the string provided which is helpful if the translation begins to lag behind the sites text at all as at least something will be output
4861061 hello dunder will print the translation of that string if one exists hello dunder if not
4861062 exactly moving on your plural function breaks even in english if we have a word where the plural doesnt add an s like children
4861063 no harm done better to provide both singular and plural words to the function and let it decide which to use performing any translation as well
4861064 wed have to provide different functions for different languages as we employed more elves and got more complicated for example in polish the word file pluralises like this 1 plik 2 4 pliki 5 21 plik w 22 24 pliki 25 31 plik w and so on
4861065 next as different languages have different word orders we must stop using concatenation to construct sentences as it would be impossible for other languages to fit in we have to keep coherent strings together lets rewrite your update function and then go through it
4861066 lastly we need to create one file for each language containing our i18n object and then include that from the relevant
4861067 you are ordering s at a total cost of s gold pieces
4861068 if you implement this across the intranet youll want to investigate the xgettext program which can automatically extract all strings that need translating from all sorts of code files into a standard po file i think python mode works best for javascript you can then use a different program to take the translated po file and automatically create the language specific javascript files for us
4861069 and there we go localised javascript in german all using the same main code
4861070 oh and one last thing please comment liberally explaining the context of strings you use
4861071 you are ordering s at a total cost of s gold pieces
4861072 you are ordering 1 s at a total cost of 2 s gold pieces

4861084 my only point is this historically i have been a strong believer in a womens right to choose with her doctor her pastor and her family and it is i have consistently been saying that you have to have a health exception on many significant restrictions or bans on abortions including late term abortions in the past there has been some fear on the part of people who not only people who are anti abortion but people who may be in the middle that that means that if a woman just doesnt feel good then that is an exception thats never been the case i dont think that is how it has been interpreted my only point is that in an area like partial birth abortion having a mental having a health exception can be defined rigorously it can be defined through physical health it can be defined by serious clinical mental health diseases it is not just a matter of feeling blue i dont think thats how pro choice folks have interpreted it i dont think thats how the courts have interpreted it and i think thats important to emphasize and understand

4861093 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4861094 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4861095 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4861096 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4861097 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4861103 the u s may be winning world speed records in swimming at the olympics but not in average internet speeds according to a new report the country that invented the internet has now sunk to 15th worldwide in the percentage of the population subscribing to broadband
4861104 infrastructure and connection is so important to economic development many future industries will be knowledge based
4861105 so heres my view we cant have a situation in which the corporate duopoly dictates the future of the internet and thats why im supporting what is called net neutrality
4861106 every american should have the highest speed broadband access no matter where you live or how much money you have well connect schools libraries and hospitals and well take on special interests to unleash the power of wireless spectrum for our safety and connectivity
4861107 philadelphias goal to cover 135 square miles with a cloud of internet connectivity was ambitious but the need was undeniable high speed internet access was fast becoming an economic educational and social necessity

4861116 moreover the bridge used to provide a route for refugees from the russian occupied territories into safe places russia is pursuing deliberate policy aimed at undermining georgias statehood including through bringing about humanitarian catastrophe
4861117 russian military helicopters started bombing the bordering territories of the city of borjomi and settlement of tsemi using incendiary munitions
4861118 russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations

4861124 hopefully ill be able to show people a new one
4861125 obviously we would have loved to have brought home more medals for the u s
4861126 we did the best we could were not asking for more at this point next time well ask for a little more
4861127 im sure all the fans in russia will be very happy about it
4861128 we were obviously disappointed that we couldnt make the gold medal match but its going to be something really special to us to have that medal back at home
4861129 to win any medal in the olympics is a huge achievement
4861130 not many of the athletes get a chance to win a medal
4861131 i have to take something positive from the way i was playing this week
4861132 thats what i expected and hoped for many years ago when i got to no 1 that if ever somebody were to take it away from me he would have to play an incredible tennis schedule win the biggest tournaments dominate the game basically i think rafa totally deserves it
4861133 its not the first time this tournament or in my life i had to serve for a big match
4861134 its basically the moment you dream of being in even though there is so much pressure to it
4861135 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull out the match
4861136 one thing i know that though i was blind now i see
4861137 when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of natures god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation
4861138 we are but i thought you were going to call me when you got to town
4861139 but i told you i was almost to my house and you should just drive down
4861140 weve been sitting here at the park waiting for you
4861141 dam i forgot you drive crazy i mean really fast too ill drive really fast ok really really fast
4861142 i have to go like in an hour and half
4861143 do not attempt this in a day you will die

4861146 but some of our results suggest that theres more going on than we might have thought

4861148 gained a precarious foothold on the outer hull of the vessel
4861149 whilst i unreservedly support the democratic right of people to protest peacefully i feel that i must register my concern at the reckless disregard for their own safety shown by the greenpeace activists
4861150 it would be an absolute tragedy if as a result of such recklessness we were now reflecting on the totally unnecessary death or serious injury of one or all of those involved in these particular protests
4861151 rigorous safety procedures are always followed and are absolutely central to the planning and execution of our actions
4861152 action was taken by our volunteers to try and prevent a potentially illegal shipment of deadly spent nuclear fuel from being transported in international waters which would have been vulnerable to both accident and terrorist attack argent added
4861153 the dangers involved in this unnecessary and irresponsible movement of radioactive material across our seas is in our opinion are far greater threat than the actions of a small group of highly trained volunteers
4861154 i am satisfied that the security of nuclear material was not compromised on any of these occasions
4861155 what i bring to henry glass is a distinctively more modern and youthful look than that of their more traditional quilt lines

4861243 ive dedicated so much to my parents but tonight it was all about val and all about coach kirsten hellier and just the hard work weve put in over the last 10 years
4861244 its been a long road but an awesome road and just a great journey to be riding its fantastic i couldnt ask for anything more than that
4861245 what i wanted to do when i came into the circle because i knew i was one of the first throwers she was out fourth was to put the presssure on the other throwers obviously it worked
4861246 every time they hopped into the circle i was always keeping an eye out because you never let your guard down until the competition is over
4861247 thats why every time i tried to throw it as far as i could i was just so happy that my series right through the competition was awesome
4861248 you know thats something you dont plan it just all happens naturally
4861249 as soon as i saw on the board that it came up that she had won i thought instantly screw the last throw ive done it ive won all i wanted to do was get to the fence and give my coach a massive hug just to celebrate the moment and soak it all in
4861250 its just such an awesome feeling to be out there with so many people around you youve busted your arse in training so hard for this one moment and to have whatever the capacity of the stadium is 91 000 here celebrating with you is just amazing
4861251 its purely the economics around the market price for raw casings as opposed to further processing and adding value based on the market returns its not adding value to affco
4861252 this casings closure is a product specific decision market driven and nothing else
4861253 affcos been scrutinising every part of its business were basically putting our finger on things that arent making us money
4861254 were not at all concerned in relation to the reduction in stock numbers were quite comfortable where we sit at the moment with that

4861263 i always compare it to when steve perry went and did oh sherrie which is a fucking journey song
4861264 it sounded exactly like journey and thats fucked up i dont want to do that
4861265 i feel like im waving the flag for musicianship trying to bring back bands that can play
4861266 it seems like a lot of music today is so churned out and simple i like playing these festivals because its one thing all day and then here i come on and everyones like whoa then back to the grind
4861267 it sounds like a banjo but they sing with it and its the most fucking passionate emotional music ive ever heard in my life
4861268 i want to include that in my album because its so passionate like when you hear a korn song and its really going crazy these guys do it with a stringy banjo i want to bring that to kids here who are like what the fuck is this and open their minds up to something different
4861269 its no secret that i had my problems during my last few years in korn
4861270 there were drug issues and i just wasnt enjoying the music any more thats why im so excited about this album i poured everything i had into it and i think ive really connected with the fans which was one of the primary purposes for doing it hopefully it will inspire those who hear it i hope they feel the magic again the same kind of feeling that i now have
4861271 its great that everyone agreed that flush should be the albums first single
4861272 it talks about flushing the bad things out of your life and trying to get a fresh start thats the story of my life over the last few years as i look back on everything i went through in korn all the drugs and alcohol i guess the bottom line is that im glad im not dead i apparently survived all of that for a reason and hopefully im fulfilling some of that now
4861273 life is boring simple story get drunk throw up sleep all day i am something im not nothing i cant let myself decay

4861288 this commitment not only moves us forward in meeting our renewable goal its also a significant step forward in the renewable energy sector
4861289 utility scale deployment of pv photovoltaic technology may well become cost competitive with other forms of renewable energy generation such as solar thermal and wind
4861290 what you are seeing here is the foundation of an industry that can deliver electricity cleanly cheaply and reliably than the fossil fuel alternatives
4861291 if the new policies are not conducive to growth and development in the agriculture sector itwill decline and for the consumer that means imported product
4861292 it sends a strong message to farmers about their future
4861293 do we stay in farming or get the hell out of here and let the government buy the water back
4861294 however in several sub catchments there is no new water available at this point while we continue to better understand the system
4861295 obviously this has to be done in the context of managing the systems and environment so we get ahead of the game and dont end up being a murray darling
4861296 its sensible for the department of water to take a precautionary approach regarding over allocating water

4861300 this commitment not only moves us forward in meeting our renewable goal its also a significant step forward in the renewable energy sector
4861301 these landmark agreements signal the arrival of utility scale pv solar power that may be cost competitive with solar thermal and wind energy
4861302 our solar farms are quiet and emission free with solar panels mounted near ground level to minimize visual impact implementing cost competitive solar power on this scale establishes thin film photovoltaic generation as an important contributor to global sustainability
4861303 today high efficiency photovoltaic technology is a competitively priced component of utility scale peak power generation
4861304 we design our solar systems to maximize energy harvest while adapting to the natural topography of the site and serving the needs of the community
4861305 its really easy for humans to change the atmosphere of the earth and thats what is causing the climate change were seeing
4861306 its our responsibility to deal with how we want the planet to change its the choices we make that represent the uncertainty about climate
4861307 in order to really move forward we really need ideas
4861308 if were not showing them this is an important issue worth spending our time on we lose all that wonderful energy and their ideas
4861309 theres potential there to add carbon dioxide emissions many times what we have
4861310 plop plop pew pew oh what a relief for you
4861311 england is something i want to be part of with a new world cup campaign coming up
4861312 its a good place to be playing for your country ive managed to do it in the past and to be involved again would be great i think my game is suited to international football ive played a few games for england and done ok ive had a taste of it and i want more so well see
4861313 you have to judge it on the size of the games you are playing
4861314 i know him very well and saw lots of his games last season he is a very good player and it is possible we have to wait until the next game because after the games it is possible there will be injuries and we have to decide then
4861315 as a player you do what you can and look after what you can control i was playing well and being successful at united so that was my main concern this season could be a fresh start to press my claims im just trying to get fitter and look forward to the start of the season whatever comes after that is a bonus
4861316 being champions two years on the spin makes you a big scalp and everyone is going for it against us
4861317 we managed to overcome that challenge last season and once youve had that success it drives you on even more well improve this season as well as other teams and its about who can do it over the course of a season and be consistent weve managed to do it over the last couple of seasons but its a test again for us we start again and were ready for it
4861318 the potential legal implications of texting while driving go far beyond the possibility of a mere traffic violation
4861319 in the case of a traffic accident proof that the driver was texting while driving may be used to help prove liability for an accident even in states that do not ban texting while driving
4861320 kids who have shaved the olympics logo into their heads
4861321 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
4861322 its easy for those of us with plentiful food supplies to ignore the issue but we have a responsibility to use science to help the less well off where we can im asking to see the evidence if it has been a disaster then please provide the evidence
4861323 i dont understand the reasoning behind the assertion that this is dangerous for climate change
4861324 usually we welcome prince charless contributions to various debates but on this issue he seems to have overstepped the mark
4861325 should the uk change our policy on gm to one that is more liberal
4861326 this was in no way an attempt to lay down a challenge to government policy the princes considerable interests in the environment are non political he simply cares for the future
4861327 her threesome with tera cox had my balls boiling over and i always enjoy seeing her get fucked in whatever she does what i love most of all about april is that shes exactly the opposite of a hard looking porn star shes a sloe eyed southern gal who just happens to have giant real floppers and enjoys fucking and shes not ashamed of it

4861335 well no one informed me i wouldnt have bought one had i known but i guess thats the plan wouldnt sell as many phones if people knew the truth lying by omission is still lying
4861336 as much as the chip may be the chief problem glitches may also stem from apples software or the at amp t network part of the role of the infineon chip is to check whether theres enough 3g bandwidth available in a given area if 3g isnt available or there isnt enough bandwidth the iphone will be shifted to a slower network one source says apple programmed the infineon chip to demand a more powerful 3g signal than the iphone really requires so if too many people try to make a call or go on the internet in a given area some of the devices will decide theres insufficient power and switch to the slower network even if there is enough 3g bandwidth available according to this person the problems are only occurring in areas of high iphone density these include the san francisco bay area boston and certain overseas locales the reason the problem has gotten worse in recent days is because of the steep increase in iphone activations in these places the more people who are trying to use a given piece of gear the more likely they are to get bumped

4861369 were working to not get just one crew chief were working to get a pair of crew chiefs that are going to work well together
4861370 it helps us work together better as drivers and keeps the organization just that much more intact
4861371 ive seen multicar organizations that the crew chiefs were in different directions with each other and they dont utilize the opportunity of what a two car team is all about in the right way
4861372 weve been in a lot of meetings in the last four weeks with a lot of different people from different organizations that have come to us wanting to be a part of this
4861373 joe has been a huge part of that you know its just talking to the right people
4861374 that just gives us that many more options and people to choose from
4861375 we are getting people hired we have commitments from people that were currently working on contracts right now that are some key people that we think are really going to be able to help us build this program
4861376 i shudder to think what will happen if we dont move aggressively to build those firebreaks remove those dead and dying trees and clean out as much underbrush as possible

4861378 i was pushing the envelope a little bit because he was playing well he was kind of our igniter and you kind of hate to take a guy out like that i kick myself for it a little bit
4861379 weve been close before i dont know if we would have been able to get by tony or not he was pretty quick
4861380 the car was awesome all day there were a couple of cars that were real fast tony and brian vickers but my pit crew just did a great job there at the end i dont know what kind of problem tony had on pit road but it was sure a lot easier to pass him there than it would have been on the racetrack
4861381 weve certainly had more than our share of good finishes here and it seems like its a track where we always race well
4861382 you dont want to come across greedy but im getting sick and tired of not winning one of these races
4861383 we feel like every race weve been in weve led but we havent led the right lap
4861384 i really feel like it was the power difference between the ford and the toyotas with the new restrictor plate carl just got too far out ahead of us at the end and we didnt have enough time
4861385 i never thought it would be such a big deal but it has been its not like ill never these guys again but i know this is the last time im going to work with this particular group of guys
4861386 he was a real selfless pioneer who would push the envelope in art and technology without great expectations of returns
4861387 he didnt need to make a lot of money he didnt need to be famous he really just wanted to do great work
4861388 theyre taking care of him and were very grateful for it
4861389 the baseball gods have been with us a little bit
4861390 i just kept telling the kids to keep believing in themselves

4861392 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
4861393 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
4861394 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
4861395 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
4861396 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
4861397 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet

4861404 hectors wife is at home warming his bath though he has in fact died moments before auden praised bruegel in mus e des beaux arts for noticing that while icarus fell a ship was calmly moving on through the waves unnoticing in the dunkirk section of ian mcewans atonement the protagonist a british soldier retreating through chaos and death toward dunkirk sees a barge going by
4861405 in my own reality i know that these things did happen
4861406 without him in them i can display them i can look at those pictures and think of the laughter we were sharing the places we went to
4861407 it used to be that photographs provided documentary evidence and there was something sacrosanct about that
4861408 the home ministry officials said it was not feasible to grant her a resident permit till it was clear whether she would be allowed to go to calcutta or not the bengal government has not yet responded to the centres letter asking if taslima could stay in calcutta and taslima herself has not made up her mind on an alternative residence
4861409 we have to wait and see how the situation develops only then a decision on a permanent resident permit can be taken as of now it is a big no
4861410 even taslima seems to have mellowed all this time in the loneliness of the safe house and her break in sweden must have given her time to contemplate and introspect the fact that she has decided to come back to india means that she is ready to accept the conditions
4861411 the agitated mob pelted stones and damaged the outpost in a few minutes they were repeatedly directed to get out of the police station firing was ordered only when the situation went out of control
4861412 the guard beat up the civilian and fled the outpost when the public attempted to nab him the firing took place after the villagers rushed to the outpost seeking justice
4861413 the picture will be clear once we get a detailed investigation report hamren subdivisional officer civil rakesh kumar has been directed to take stock of the situation tomorrow
4861414 i am happy that leading industrialists and corporate houses will be present at the august 19 interactive session at the chamber
4861415 i look forward to answering all their queries about my stand on industry in the state i would also make an attempt to clear doubts of critics who think the trinamul congress leadership is anti industry
4861416 it would be a privilege to set forth my views that industry is required for our state but not at the expense of the life and livelihood of farmers
4861417 i would utilise this opportunity to dispel the notion that our party doesnt want industry
4861418 we wanted to hear her views and discuss the industrial climate of the state its going to be a general discussion and not about anything particular
4861419 i cannot have a dialogue with them on how to ensure smooth construction of the tata motors plant by sacrificing the interests of poor farmers our agitation scheduled to start on august 24 at singur stands
4861420 not aware of a receipt of any communication from the tatas that they want to discuss singur
4861421 mera bhi naam guruji hai aur main bhi politics kar sakta hoon yeh main dikha doonga sirf 24 ghante ka intezaar phir yaa to meri sarkar yaa rashtrpati shashan ke liye koda ho jayen taiyyar my name is guru ji and i too know politics after 24 hours either its my government or its presidents rule koda better beware
4861422 the jmm central committee will formally decide to make soren jharkhand chief minister the legislature party will formally elect him its new leader
4861423 we have always been opposed to the koda government now soren too wants to get rid of koda the congress will be benefited either way be it soren becoming chief minister or jharkhand being put under the presidents rule
4861424 very good his tenure as chief minister was very good
4861425 in coalition governments chief ministers do change and it has happened in jharkhand before
4861426 we are clear on our stand to form the government in jharkhand and there is no if and but about it inside the party and among our mlas we will get our share at the centre as well
4861427 your going to break up with me because you still crazy in love with you damn ex girlfriend cant you see im here im willing to love you more than to life
4861428 still black still proud an african tribute to james brown
4861429 im not sure i understand it but its fun to sing along with and for me its always been a good luck song
4861430 its been around for so long and i think that anybody who adopts it has some of that good luck the fact that the red sox have adopted it proves the point
4861431 i put home runs and good pitching in front of the song
4861432 but the song does capture the spirit of the team
4861433 i thought hot august night was a no 1 album but maybe not in billboard
4861434 people are complicated there are many facets and i like to explore as many of them as possible
4861435 i think writing a song like america a bombastic interpretation of the immigrant experience is as valid as writing a song like the comparatively downbeat confessional i am i said thats why theyre still around and thats why i still do them in concert
4861436 rick was able to hone in on the simplicity of the songs im writing and not make a big deal about the production elements it does put a terrible onus on the songs
4861437 theres no dressing and frosting and bells and whistles so it has to have substance to work the songs are still about relationships because thats what i know least about so i guess i write about it to try to understand it but there is a maturity and perspective that comes with age sometimes its painfully gained but as far as songs are concerned it gives depth and color that you cant get anywhere else
4861438 i was blown away by how committed and how open minded he was
4861439 we would get to the studio and neil would already be there and wed work all day and in between takes hed be adjusting a word here or there to make it perfect and we would leave and he was still there neil would try anything if he thought it would make the song better he was completely fearless and not at all self conscious
4861440 when i was a teenager i wanted to be a research biologist and discover the cure for cancer
4861441 i tell you id like to write as many wonderful songs as i possibly can before i disappear from this planet
4861442 last year i went up to a couple random people had a casual conversation for about a minute then lunged at them out of nowhere and tried to kiss them

4861449 i thought it went smoother than tuesdays scrimmage and i thought there were some good things
4861450 we got our kickoffs punt returns and punt coverages in and we got some field goals too
4861451 from this point on were really going to look at our personnel see how many people were working with and really try to cut back to the people who are going to be on the field against east carolina
4861452 we can expect anything if we put our mind to it
4861453 overall as an offense weve just got to get the ball in the end zone more often carrying the ball brought back memories of me having the ball in my hands in high school and rushing like i wanted to it felt great
4861454 the offensive penalties held us back we were lined up wrong a few times and there were a couple of holding calls and weve got to get those things taken care of
4861455 those types of things can stop a drive in a hurry
4861456 since august 2005 we feel fine has been harvesting human feelings from a large number of weblogs

4861463 she blew me away her songs reminded me of records i have in my own collection and i was sure i could produce them
4861464 we spent a year working on more demos and within a week of playing them for my own publisher warner chapelle we had offers from every major label in the uk
4861465 when i got the amazing chance to sign a record deal my mother said well you take it now and if it goes wrong youre still young you can go back to university and do whatever you were going to do anyway id applied and had been accepted i was all ready to go i thought id be a geography teacher and i still can be far far away from what im doing now
4861466 why does he not snuff me out for i dont know what lifes about the debt i owe for sin is high still he lets me live love work and die
4861467 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4861468 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4861469 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4861470 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4861471 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4861472 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4861473 turn that music down before i call the cops on ya

4861487 i was honored david let me post his essay about rss and medical libraries here at ttw and tickled when he launched his blog
4861488 for medical librarians check out david rothman who actually gets the value of rss feeds for clinicians and delivers useful commentary and information for librarians if i were in charge of a library id actively recruit david to be on my team if youre not a librarian check out his blog anyway for a peak behind the librarian curtain and a view of the kinds of services you should be getting
4861489 i consider david rothman the rss feed advocate for medical libraries he does so much with rss feeds and he is constantly looking for instances where they are applicable to medical libraries when i have an rss feed question i pick his brain
4861490 im not even a medical health science librarian and im fascinated by the work yall are doing
4861491 your blog is always interesting really look forward to your posts
4861492 david the work that you and others are doing is top drawer
4861493 i always talk about your blog because ive found it useful and interesting so ill take this opportunity to say a big thank you for your blog keep writing
4861494 your blog seems to have caught the eye of quite a few people your efforts have opened a lot of eyes about the possibilities of setting up rss feeds directly for end users resulting in encouraging greater investigation of and participation in electronic delivery on the part of the patron i will be following your blog with great interest

4861498 david rothman finds the most interesting things to share on his blog he writes about and gives real life examples of web2 0 and library2 0 put to use in health sciences libraries many of the ideas and applications he flags have wider applicability outside the health sciences well worth the read if youre interested in what hsl2 0 might look like

4861505 to the people of madyan madian we sent their brother shuaib
4861506 o my people worship allah you have no other ilah god but him verily a clear proof sign from your lord has come unto you so give full measure and full weight and wrong not men in their things and do not mischief on the earth after it has been set in order that will be better for you if you are believers and sit not on every road threatening and hindering from the path of allah those who believe in him and seeking to make it crooked remember when you were but few and he multiplied you see what was the end of the mufsideen mischief makers corrupts and liars and if there is a party of you who believes in that which i have been sent and a party who do not believe so be patient until allah judges between us and he is the best of judges
4861507 we shall certainly drive you out o shuaib and those who have believed with you from our town or else you all shall return to our religion
4861508 even though we hate it we should have invented a lie against allah if we returned to your religion after allah has rescued us from it it is not for us to return to it unless allah our lord should will our lord comprehends all things in his knowledge in allah alone we put our trust our lord judge between us and our people in truth for you are the best of those who gives judgment

4861516 allah has heard the way your people have responded he has therefore sent this angel in charge of the mountains you may command him as you please
4861517 if you like i would overturn the mountains from either side upon these people
4861518 no but i expect that allah will create from their seed those who will worship none but allah the one
4861519 my lord indeed my bones have grown feeble and gray hair has spread on my head and i have never been unblest in my invocation to you o my lord and verily i fear my relatives after me since my wife is barren so give me from yourself an heir who shall inherit me and inherit also the posterity of jacob inheritance of the religious knowledge and prophethood not the wealth etc and make him my lord one with whom you are well pleased
4861520 o zakariyah verily we give you the glad tidings of a son his name will be yahya john we have given that name to none before him

4861524 o my lord grant me from you a good offspring you are indeed the all hearer of invocation
4861525 allah gives you glad tidings of yahya confirming believing in the word from allah
4861526 o my lord how can i have a son when i am very old and my wife is barren
4861527 your sign is that you shall not speak to mankind for three days except with signals and remember your lord much by praising him again and again and glorify him in the afternoon and in the morning
4861528 shall i not tell you he who had the best food it is yahya ibn zakariyah who joined the beasts at dinner fearing to mix with men
4861529 my son i have been searching for you and you are dwelling in this grave weeping
4861530 o father did you not tell me that between paradise and hell is only a span and it will not be crossed except by tears of weepers
4861531 the dwellers of paradise are sleepless out of the sweetness of allahs bounty that is why the faithful must be sleepless because of allahs love in their hearts how far between the two luxuries how far between them
4861532 i would love to have the head of yahya because he has defiled your honor and mine throughout the land if you grant me this wish i shall be very happy and will offer myself to you
4861533 we and our forefathers have worshipped these gods for many years and no harm has come to us
4861534 in that case i will leave you to your misery
4861535 since they knew him to be the most honorable among them they did not wish to throw him into the angry sea therefore they decided to draw a second lot again s name was drawn they gave him a final chance and drew a third lot unfortunately for realized that allahs hand was in all this for he had abandoned his mission without allahs consent the matter was over and it was decided that should throw himself into the water stood at the edge of the ship looking at the furious sea it was night and there was no moon the stars were hidden behind a black fog but before he could be thrown overboard kept mentioning allahs name as he jumped into the raging sea and disappeared beneath the huge waves floating on the waves before it it swallowed into its furious stomach and shut its ivory teeth on him as if they were white bolts locking the door of his prison the whale dived to the bottom of the sea the sea that runs in the abyss of darkness three layers of darkness enveloped him one above the other the darkness of the whales stomach the darkness of the bottom of the sea the darkness of the night yunus imaged himself to be dead but his senses became alert when he found he could move he knew that he was alive and imprisoned in the midst of three layers of darkness his heart was moved by remembering allah his tongue released soon after saying la ilaha illa anta none has the right to be worshipped but you o allah glorified and exalted be you above all that evil they associate with you truly i have been of the wrong doers
4861536 why should i be afraid allah commanded me to swallow him
4861537 did you brin it an hour ago and ask me to pray for you
4861538 i will bless you and your offspring and make this land for you and for those who come after you
4861539 you deceived me i was engaged to rachel and you married me to leah
4861540 it is not our tradition to marry the younger daughter before the elder daughter however if you love her sister work another seven years and i will marry you to both of them
4861541 i have been blessed because of you ask for whatever money you need
4861542 give me each spotted and speckled goat born this year and each black lamb
4861543 when you meet my brother esau he will ask you to whom do you belong where are you going you shall say they belong to your servant yaqub they are a present to my master esau moreover he is behind us
4861544 after today you shall not be called anything but israel
4861545 circumcise all of you and we will give our daughters to you and we will take your daughters for ourselves but we do not marry with uncircumcised people
4861546 i have submitted myself as a muslim to the lord of the alamin mankind jinn and all that exists
4861547 o my sons allah has chosen for you the true religion then die not except in the faith of islam as muslims islamic monotheism
4861548 we shall worship you ilah god allah the ilah god of your fathers ibrahim ismail ishaq one ilah god and to him we submit in islam
4861549 be jews or christians and then you will be guided
4861550 nay we follow only the religion of ibrahim hanifan islamic monotheism i e to worship none but allah alone and he was not of the al mushrikeen those who worshipped others along with allah
4861551 we believe in allah and that which has been sent down to us and that which had been sent down to ibrahim ismail ishaq yaqub and to al asbat the twelve sons of yaqub and that which has been given to musa and isa and that which has been given to the prophets from their lord we make no distinction between any of them and to him we have submitted in islam
4861552 dispute you with us about allah while he is our lord and your lord and we are to be rewarded for our deeds and you for your deeds we are sincere to him in worship and obedience i e we worship him alone and none else and we obey his orders
4861553 follow the religion of ibrahim hanifan islamic monotheism to worship none but allah and he was not of the mushrikeen polytheists pagans idolaters disbeliveers in the oneness of allah and his messenger muhammad those who worship others along with allah or set up rivals with or partners to allah
4861554 o my people worship allah you have no other ilah god but him
4861555 o salih you have been among us as a figure of good hope and we wished for you to be our chief till this new thing which you have brought that we leave our gods and worship your god allah alone do you now forbid us the worship of what our fathers have worshipped but we are really in grave doubt as to that which you invite us to monotheism
4861556 ask your lord to make a she camel which must be 10 months pregnant tall and attractive issue from the rock for us
4861557 look now if allah sends you what you have requested just as you have described will you believe in that which i have come to you with and have faith in the message i have been sent with
4861558 o my people this she camel of allah is a sign to you leave her to feed on allahs earth and touch her not with evil lest a near torment will seize you
4861559 enjoy life for 3 more days then the punishment will descend upon you
4861560 my people why do you hasten to evil rather than good why do not you ask pardon of allah so that you may receive mercy
4861561 we see your presence and that of your followers as bringing evil on us
4861562 o my people why do you seek to hasten the evil torment before the good allahs mercy why seek you not the forgiveness of allah that you may receive mercy
4861563 your ill omen is with allah nay but you are a people that are being tested
4861564 swear to another by allah that we shall make a secret night attack on him and his household and afterwards we will surely say to his near relatives
4861565 so they ploa plot and we planned a plan while they perceived not
4861566 o my people worship allah you have no other ilah god but him none has the right to be worshipped but allah indeed there has come to you a clear sign the miracle of the coming out of a huge she camel from the midst of a rock from your lord this she camel of allah is a sign unto you so you leave her to graze in allahs earth and touch her not with harm lest a painful torment should size you remember when he made you successors after ad people and gave you habitations in the land you build for yourselves palaces in plains and carve out homes in the mountains so remember the graces bestowed upon you from allah and do not go about making mischief on the earth
4861567 know you that salih is one sent from his lord
4861568 we indeed believe in that with which he has been sent
4861569 o salih bring about your threats if you are indeed one of the messengers of allah
4861570 o my people i have indeed conveyed to you the message of my lord and have give you good advise but you like not good advisers
4861571 i fear that you may be affected by what afflicted them so do no enter upon them
4861572 the prophets property will not be inherited and whatever we leave is to be used for charity
4861573 all the praises and thanks be to allah who has preferred us above many of his believing slaves
4861574 o mankind we have been taught the language of birds and on us have been bestowed all things this verily is an evident grace from allah
4861575 i surely love the finer things of life than the service of my lord return them to me
4861576 my lord forgive me and bestow upon me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me verily you are the bestower
4861577 this is our gift so spend you or withhold no account will be asked
4861578 run to your homes otherwise unaware sulaiman and his army might crush you
4861579 o ants enter your dwellings lest sulaiman and his hosts crush you while they perceive not
4861580 my lord inspire and bestow upon me the power and ability that i maybe grateful for your favors which you have bestowed on me and on my parents and that i may do righteous good deeds that will please you and admit me by your mercy among your righteous slaves
4861581 i have discovered something of which you are not aware i have come from sheba saba with important news
4861582 saba is ruled by a queen named bilkis bilqis who has plenty of everything including a splendid throne but in spite of all this wealth satan has entered her heart and the hearts of her people she rules their minds completely i was shocked to learn that they worship the sun instead of allah the almighty
4861583 peace and friendship are better and wiser war only brings humiliation enslaves people and destroys the good things i have decided to send gifts to sulaiman selected from our most precious treasure the courtiers who will deliver the gifts will also have an opportunity to learn about sulaiman and his military mighty
4861584 allah hagiven me plenty of wealth a large kingdom and prophethood i am therefore beyond bribery my only objective is to spread the belief in tawheed the oneness of allah
4861585 i will bring it to you before this sitting is over
4861586 i will fetch it for you in the twinkling of an eye
4861587 it is as if it were the very one and resembles mine in every respect
4861588 what is the matter that i see not a hoopoe or is he among the absentees i will surely punish him with a severe torment or slaughter him unless he brings me a clear reason
4861589 i have grasped the knowledge of a thing which you have not grasped and i have come to you from sheba with true news i found a woman ruling over them and she has been given all things that could be possessed by any ruler of the earth and she has a great throne i found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of allah and satan has made their deeds fair seeming to them and has barred them from allahs way so they have no guidance
4861590 we shall see whether you speak the truth or you are one of the liars go with this letter of mine and deliver it to them then draw back from them and see what answer they return
4861591 o chiefs verily here is a delivered to me a noble letter verily it is from sulaiman and verily it reads in the name of allah the most beneficent the most merciful be you not exalted against me but come to me as muslims true believers who submit to allah with full submission
4861592 o chiefs advise me in this case of mine i decide no case till you are present with me
4861593 we have great strength and great ability for war but it is for you to command so think over what you will command
4861594 verily kings when they enter a town country they despoil it and make the most honorable amongst its people low and thus they do but verily i am going to send him a present and see with what answer the messengers return
4861595 will you help me in wealth what allah has given me is better than that which he has given you nay you rejoice in your gift
4861596 go back to them we verily shall come to them with hosts that they cannot resist and we shall drive them out from there is disgrace and they will be abased
4861597 o chiefs which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me surrendering themselves in obedience
4861598 i will bring it to you before you rise from your place council and verily i am indeed strong and trustworthy for such work
4861599 i will bring it to you within the twinkling of an eye
4861600 this is by the grace of my lord to test me whether i am grateful or ungrateful and whoever is grateful truly his gratitude is for the good of his ownself and whoever is ungrateful he is ungrateful only for the loss of his ownself certainly my lord is rich free of all wants bountiful
4861601 disguise her throne for her that we may see whether she will be guided to recognize her throne or she will be one of those not guided
4861602 knowledge was bestowed on us before her and we were submitted to allah in islam as muslims before her
4861603 verily it is sarh paved smooth with slab of glass
4861604 my lord verily i have wronged myself and i submit in islam together with sulaiman to allah the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
4861605 o my father verily i saw in a dream eleven stars and the sun and the moon i saw them prostrating themselves to me
4861606 the most honorable person is yusuf allahs prophet the son of allahs prophet the son of the faithful friend of allah abraham
4861607 o my son relate not your vision to your brothers lest they arrange a plot against you verily satan is to man an open enemy thus will your lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of dreams an other things and perfect his favor on you and on the offspring of yaqub as he perfected it on your fathers abraham and isaac aforetime verily your lord is all knowing all wise
4861608 kill not yusuf but if you must do something throw him down to the bottom of a well he will be picked up by some caravan of travelers
4861609 why should we not kill him and have rest so that the favor of your father may be give to you alone
4861610 there is no need to kill him when all you want is to get rid of him look here let us throw him into a well and he will be picked up by a passing caravan t hey will take him with them to a distant land he will disappear from your fathers sight and our purpose will be served with his exile then after that we shall repent for our crime and become good people once again
4861611 o our father why do you not trust us with yusuf when we are indeed his well wishers send him with us tomorrow to enjoy himself and play and verily we will take care of him
4861612 truly it saddens me that you should take him away i fear lest a wolf should devour him while you are careless of him
4861613 if a wolf devours him while we are usbah a strong group to guard him then surely we are the losers
4861614 o our father we went racing with one another and left yusuf by our belongings and a wolf devoured him but you will never believe us even when we speak the truth 12 17
4861615 we were surprised after returning from the race that yusuf was in the belly of the wolf
4861616 you will not believe us even though we are truthful we are telling you what happened
4861617 this is yusufs shirt we foiled it soiled with blood and did not find yusuf
4861618 what a merciful wolf he ate up my beloved son without tearing his shirt
4861619 nay but your ownselves have made up a tale so for me patience is more fitting it is allah alone whose help can be sought against that which you assert
4861620 better give me a hand fellows looks like i found real treasure in the well
4861621 make his stay comfortable may be he will profit us or we shall adopt him as a son
4861622 i seek refuge in allah or allah forbid truly he your husband is my master he made my stay agreeable so i will never betray him verily the zalimun wrong evildoers will never be successful
4861623 certainly you shall no authority over my slaves except those who follow you of the ghawin mushrikeen and those who go astray criminals polytheists and evildoers etc
4861624 what is the recompense punishment for him who intended an evil design against your wife except that he be put in prison or a painful torment
4861625 surely it is a plot of you women certainly mighty is you plot
4861626 if it be that his shirt is torn from the front then her tale is true and he is a liar but if it be that his shirt is torn from the back then she has told a lie and he is speaking the truth
4861627 the wife of al aziz is seeking to seduce her slave young man indeed she loves him violently verily we see her in plain error
4861628 i have heard of those who say i have fallen in love with the young hebrew man yusuf
4861629 i admit that he is charming fellow i do not deny that i love him i have loved him for a long time
4861630 this is the one for whom i have been blamed i do not deny that i tempted him you have been enchanted by yusuf and see what has happened to your hands i have tempted him and if he does not do what i want of him he shall be imprisoned
4861631 how perfect is allah or allah forbid no man is this this is none other than a noble angel
4861632 this is he the young man about whom you did blame me for his love and i did seek to seduce him but he refused and now if he refuses to obey my order he shall certainly be cast into prison and will be one of those who are disgraced
4861633 o my lord prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me unless you turn away their plot from me i will feel inclined towards them and be one of those who commit sin and deserve blame or those who do deeds of the ignorants

4861641 stewart haas racing has had and will continue to have discussions with numerous people regarding leadership positions within the team including crew chiefs for the nos 4 and 14 teams at this point no decisions have been made in regard to filling those positions
4861642 were working to not get just one crew chief were working to get a pair of crew chiefs that are going to work well together
4861643 it helps us work together better as drivers and keeps the organization just that much more intact
4861644 ive seen multicar organizations that the crew chiefs were in different directions with each other and they dont utilize the opportunity of what a two car team is all about in the right way
4861645 weve been in a lot of meetings in the last four weeks with a lot of different people from different organizations that have come to us wanting to be a part of this
4861646 joe has been a huge part of that you know its just talking to the right people

4861670 the approach or approaches didnt come two days before he left
4861671 that situation has been going on since the end of last season when me and martin bain went to sign carlos we had a discussion about whether we put that clause in whether it was acceptable to us the transfer wouldnt have happened without it of course i would go down that road again but maybe id make the fee bigger this time but if he had been playing at that level for osasuna we wouldnt have got him for the money we did
4861672 he is a good all round midfielder and we need a bit more presence in there were too reliant on ferguson we need an improvement in our overall possession of the ball and i think hell be able to bring that
4861673 were after a couple and id hope at the very least well get one more
4861674 a club who are prepared to sell will wait as long as they possibly can hoping that the fee rises thats one of the things weve been finding as ive been trying to sign three or four players finding the fee that i feel is a justifiable one and one that can fit into our overall budget
4861675 thats been difficult but thats what clubs do and thats why theres a rush at the last minute in the transfer window we started six weeks before the end of the transfer window and as was proved the likelihood of getting players in before our first competitive game was difficult and we never really managed to do it
4861676 hes a good player a spanish youth international who has played for valencia and gained experience while on loan at other clubs in europe and moving here can only help him further
4861677 seriously hes looked sharp considering hes not had as much pre season training as the rest of the squad and i think hell be a good signing for us

4861729 the completions the incomplete passes and things you look at the numbers and say he struggled theres reasons for things that happened each play he did misfire on a couple of them he had people in his face in a couple plays he couldnt step up
4861730 a quarterbacks back foot hits the ground for example hes supposed to cut the ball loose and the receivers not out of the break those are things that need to be corrected
4861731 we have a lot of things to work on and have to do a better job of getting first downs and extending drives we have to convert third and short and also catch the ball we have a lot of things to work on
4861732 we need to get on the same page a little better we need to get some of those easy passes in one on one coverage weve got to complete those
4861733 i just have got to complete the ball thats basically it i have to continue to keep working as a receiver corps we got to just get the team to keep working on the little things thats basically it but on my part my reads and everything were right
4861734 this event shows the pipes work and that if you put on great programming that people want to watch then theyll show up
4861735 everyone of us who has visited here comes away with a deep admiration for the chinese people so much to admire here and so much to learn
4861736 the more i rest the more i take care of my ankle then ill be closer to 100 percent
4861737 if im not 100 ill probably be 95 96 which ill definitely take
4861738 weve all talked about it and laughed about it and in some cases cried about it and were all starting to relax now
4861739 stewart haas racing has had and will continue to have discussions with numerous people regarding leadership positions within the team including crew chiefs for the nos 4 and 14 teams at this point no decisions have been made in regard to filling those positions
4861740 were working to not get just one crew chief were working to get a pair of crew chiefs that are going to work well together
4861741 it helps us work together better as drivers and keeps the organization just that much more intact
4861742 ive seen multicar organizations that the crew chiefs were in different directions with each other and they dont utilize the opportunity of what a two car team is all about in the right way
4861743 weve been in a lot of meetings in the last four weeks with a lot of different people from different organizations that have come to us wanting to be a part of this
4861744 joe has been a huge part of that you know its just talking to the right people
4861745 that just gives us that many more options and people to choose from
4861746 thats how eliminationist hate works regardless of its target its aim is to threaten and intimidate not merely the immediate target but anyone who might think of speaking out on their behalf
4861747 its a fairly self explanatory term it describes a kind of politics and culture that shuns dialogue and the democratic exchange of ideas for the pursuit of outright elimination of the opposing side either through complete suppression exile and ejection or extermination
4861748 a call for action on behalf of the victims of homosexuality
4861749 sooner or later this violence is going to spread to whites
4861750 no christian would pray for violence but it would be utterly naive to sweep this issue of islam under the carpet
4861751 im not out to combat anybody im only doing what the holy spirit tells me to do im living my faith practicing and preaching that jesus christ is the one and only way to god and they respect me for it they know where we stand
4861752 carrying out this responsibility is imperative in the quest for peaceful and credible results that would be acceptable to all
4861753 my goodness you think this is worthy of a response
4861754 ill just point out a few areas of total sillyness which is irrelevant because the apostolic teaching even for a protestant is not limited to what is found in the ot
4861755 the church has never existed without her teaching authority and without the oral tradition in the form of the preaching of the apostles
4861756 and in your world scripture means whatever steve says it means but were not told how this is different
4861757 thats like saying that because paul interprets genesis therefore paul is a higher authority than genesis and pauls teaching and interpretation was not subject to the higher court of the law and the prophets of course that is silliness
4861758 which makes this whole discussion irrelevant since we cannot empart internal light or prayer via the internet
4861759 yeah and neither side is disputing scriptura it is the sola part which is at issue
4861760 so the magisterium has never quoted a commentary quite a bold claim that needs to be proven how is steve different to the magisterium again
4861761 all of it presumably since they read the bible like you and me what parts of scripture has steve interpreted
4861762 how is this a response that makes steve different to the magisterium
4861763 thats like saying that every possible belief system must be on an epistemological par because they all have to be filtered through ones own ears and brain if you want to believe that hello absolute relativism
4861764 how is this different to steve again he defines what scripture is for steve and he defines what it means to steve so i guess there is no hope that steve could be subject to scripture right
4861765 thats like saying that because paul interprets genesis therefore paul is a higher authority than genesis and pauls teaching and interpretation was not subject to the higher court of the law and the prophets of course that is silliness
4861766 i wasnt the one who claimed that internal light is needed to interpret scripture if its internal light that we need shut up now and let those with internal light bask in it but if its commentary we need then an infallible one is on an epistemologically higher plane than protestant fallible ones here i guess is where you will equivocate on whether we need commentaries or not
4861767 perspicuity does not exclude the means necessary for interpretation i e the internal light of the spirit attention of mind the voice and ministry of the church sermons and commentaries prayer and watchfulness for we hold these means not only to be useful but also necessary ordinarily
4861768 and weve yet to hear why we should care im sure everyone is quite aware of the existence of the ot but were also aware that the oral teaching exceeded the ot thus the apostles were not practitioners of sola scriptura
4861769 much of the oral tradition is the traditional understanding of scripture things like what the eucharist means who should be baptised how the church should be run and so forth im sure you know full well the catholic position on these things
4861770 the same way you can know genesis through to revelation is prophetic
4861771 who claimed there is a list or we need a list
4861772 functionally it is identical because steve never goes against steves interpretation
4861773 if so then a magisterium which clarifies what the bible is unclear about would put catholics on a higher plane than protestants
4861774 and theres a substantial agreement i would say between the church fathers in their exegesis funny how you always want to play that down and play up protestant agreement
4861775 john made a further distinction that of a living interpreter there is a fundamental advantage of having a living teacher compared to teaching yourself thats why we still have schools and not just books
4861776 that why the eunuch said how can i understand unless someone guides me
4861777 what have i said which would lead you to ask such a question would you be happy if an agnostic asked you this question because of your committment to biblical inerrency
4861778 clearly a rule of faith with an infallible interpreter to resolve disputes is better than a rule of faith with nobody to resolve thats why we have courts and appellate courts and not just everybody or every local court making up their own mind
4861779 if you want to concede that steve cannot be subject to scripture then we can proceed
4861780 the jewish priesthood call them a magisterium if you like must have been carrying out their basic functions correctly since god put them in charge with the responsibility over the temple to carry out their priestly duties for the people if you want to say that the jews as individuals were at liberty to abandon the levites and set up a brand new priesthood if they werent happy with the preaching of the priests then you would be at odds with biblical history
4861781 and the way you understand this concept and apply it here makes this blog and discussion obsolete
4861782 we believe god guides his church throughout history and yet we have a low view of providence ha
4861783 i think the issue is not whether i can point to a particular commentary which is infallible but rather that the church is infallible and the documents it produces as a whole considering its various writers can point you to the churchs infallible understanding
4861784 on the other hand a commentary of a schismatic or heretic is simply one opinion versus another at least as likely to point one away from the truth as towards it
4861785 we have to limit our analysis of antecedent probabilities to exclude those which are clearly not true
4861786 its no use saying that the antecedent probability is that god would only ever create polka dotted dragons when clearly we are not polka dotted dragons to introduce absurd possibilities to argue against potentially true probabilities is a bad argument
4861787 that would only seem probable if it was a system which seemed to work however it has never worked in keeping christians united
4861788 so maybe there will be a vatican iii if the church considers the points of dispute significant enough to warrant clarification
4861789 to claim we dont need councils to clarify things because people might misinterpret councils would be to say we dont need pauls commentary on genesis because someone might misinterpret paul the fact is having paul is better than not having paul even though paul can be misinterpreted if we didnt have pauls interpretation christianity would be considerably impoverished
4861790 if we assume that his memories are a valid reason for knowing his surroundings arent real and that his memories cant have been interfered with then the proposition has been proven by the memories it might be difficult to transfer the proof to someone else because of the technological problem of proving what is in your brain but it would be adequately proven to oneself but if the memories are not a valid reason to believe because they may have been faked then the person cant know what they think they know at all the normal rules of proof or evidence are as applicable as in any other scenario
4861791 luke wasnt there to witness many events he records either but relied on an existing ecclesiastical tradition to obtain his information
4861792 in the same way the church has always taught that the truth subsists in those ecclesiastical bodies with succession from the apostles
4861793 this is not an entirely historical question just like not everything luke wrote is entirely historical some of it is theological whether the church subsists in those bodies with succession is not something an historian is likely to address
4861794 how this establishes a blinkered catholic view of divine guidance we are not told given that the number of people in the world who have a generally catholic worldview exceeds by orders of magnitude those who hold to the style of christianity found on this blog and given that the catholic worldview puts great emphasis on this fact i would think catholics are the ones with a high regard for divine providence
4861795 in every district that we acquire land we are charged commercial rates the only difference has been bekwai

4861797 the party is going to build on what president kufuor has done
4861798 we maintain our unity as we approach the campaign towards the elections
4861799 npp is growing by the day and has so far elected 229 out of the 230 parliamentary seats
4861800 we must not allow personal ambitions to divide the party
4861801 our individual ambitions can only be achieved through the party each one should therefore remember that the interest of the party should guide us and allow the spirit of unity to direct our ranks and work to achieve our greater goal of winning power in 2008 elections
4861802 we have declared that we believe in ghana and have invited our compatriots to join us and make the call a reality
4861803 failure of the npp will be a failure of ghana and africa and we must work hard to make a memorable impact on the elections
4861804 we must work towards achieving a peaceful free and fair election and educate our supporters to engage in responsible arguments and not engage in acts that could lead to threats and tension in the country
4861805 the party which we have nurtured with all our strength should be of interest to all

4861813 namibian bones in european museums how long are the dead to remain unburied genocide with impunity
4861814 why do european museums have so much trouble with african bones
4861815 when we return the skulls somebody must accept them and without an official request we do not know whom to give them to
4861816 the council should be mandated by the government to oversee the process and ensure that these namibians are given a dignified burial
4861817 he was a real selfless pioneer who would push the envelope in art and technology without great expectations of returns
4861818 he didnt need to make a lot of money he didnt need to be famous he really just wanted to do great work

4861827 its not bothering me i dont have any type of excuses i wasnt too overwhelmed with it being the olympics its just one of those things that happened maybe i could have done some more training or more races but besides that i just kept trying to get my rhythm through each round
4861828 i thought i had a better start than i had the first two rounds its hard kind of hard to tell where youre at try to gauge yourself i pretty much ran hard to the finish line and gave it all that i had
4861829 im pretty upset when i get back to the village its really probably going to set in my familys here everyone at home is supporting me and praying for me my spirits are a little down but at the same time i gave it my best everyone knows that i feel like i just ran out of time
4861830 my aim is to just come here and win i have a lot more time to think about world records
4861831 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobodymentions is why the drugs are so expensive
4861832 pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growthyear on year and they are out to sustain that not least becausetheir senior managements earnings are related to the shareprice
4861833 its not in their interests to take less profit personallyas well as from the point of view of the business all theseperverse incentives drive the price up

4861866 how does anyone beside the device manufacturer or the wireless carrier make money
4861867 there are numerous challenges facing both lps and gps but they are generally the same recurring themes of the past in different form the real challenge this time is the massive excess of dollars seeking returns without the requisite increase in opportunities
4861868 the emphasis is on results and driving hard to self sufficiency

4861873 i think this year we have worked very hard probably as hard as ever and its just not quite happening
4861874 the poms are on top of their game theyre going to be hard to beat in most events but were going to keep trying
4861875 we always looked in control and i thought the second goal would come but west brom defended very well and we lacked a bit of sharpness around the box
4861876 we didnt get off to a great start we had one or two opportunities compared to their 15 or 20 but we go away believing we can compete in this league if we work as hard as we did today weve got a chance
4861877 we were on top in the second half and controlled the game we had chances and torres took his hes a key player who can change games
4861878 i was disappointed with the result but very pleased with the performance i was pleased with all the new players but we just did not do enough to get over the finishing line with a draw
4861879 we took the game to fulham we did not sit back
4861880 there is a lot of excitement in the city that we are here for the first time and weve got something to build on

4861885 the south korean police and prosecutors hated her because she was the lover of lee gang kook and then of col baird and nobody could touch her they waited for their chance
4861886 the korean police at the time were notorious for fabricating evidence that didnt exist
4861887 it was truly an emotional moment for me to hear him say it
4861888 they would send her right back to the torture chamber

4861892 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4861893 they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor

4861895 if he fails to decide to quit within the next two days the impeachment process will take its course

4861902 were very concerned about the soundscape and any potential visual intrusion and dust
4861903 a lot of folks are very supportive of it and would like the benefit of shaving 90 to 100 miles off their commute
4861904 locals are all for it but i wonder how heavy they federal officials will weigh it in a county losing population
4861905 its not like we just threw a dart this is not only the logical location but the only place that is feasible because of terrain
4861906 otherwise wed have to plow through 6 miles of untouched badlands
4861907 we see it as the cradle of conservation where the concept of conservation started in this country

4861910 i always wondered what my feelings would be i feel a tremendous load off my back somebody told me years ago you judge ones character by the company you keep and im just happy to be in the company of michael phelps thats the bottom line
4861911 im so proud of what hes been able to do
4861912 i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4861913 the americans have never lost that race since its been an event in the olympic games
4861914 you have to be very cautious on the relay exchanges and make sure nobody gets disqualified but it should be just a matter of what the time is going to be and whos going to put the gold medal around their neck first
4861915 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4861916 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4861917 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4861918 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4861919 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4861920 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4861921 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4861922 ive been told oldest ever female olympian of any nation of all time
4861923 im just still kicking and im not putting any restrictions on myself
4861924 im not ruling anything out i still feel good and i still have that competitive fire in me
4861925 what ive probably done in a lot of areas is that ive tried too hard
4861926 i shoot great technique ive been told this not just by u s coaches but other international coaches its just somethings happening just a few times in a match that throws me out of some competitions thats a mental thing and you know the brain the mind is a terrible thing
4861927 you still have to have the same mental approach have to have the same techniques to execute the shot
4861928 there may be a different perspective in maybe somebody who is younger or hasnt been here before but thats just all part of experience just having general experience in life
4861929 throughout shooting you will find that some things work at a certain period of time and then after a while it doesnt work any more
4861930 im way more advanced than i was when i first started shooting
4861931 but its some mental things that really grab me at certain times and it hurts me in the match
4861932 some days youre really good some days youre really bad and some days youre mediocre
4861933 thats what makes shooting interesting and i guess challenging you can shoot a perfect score and the next day go out and you arent diddly squat

4861946 you dont want to come across greedy but im getting sick and tired of not winning one of these races
4861947 we feel like every race weve been in weve led but we havent led the right lap
4861948 i really feel like it was the power difference between the ford and the toyotas with the new restrictor plate carl just got too far out ahead of us at the end and we didnt have enough time
4861949 i never thought it would be such a big deal but it has been its not like ill never see these guys again but i know this is the last time im going to work with this particular group of guys
4861950 its always tough when you beat a good friend but i havent felt this way in singles since 2004
4861951 she took every opportunity she had to come in and make me play one more shot or one more passing shot
4861952 thats the way it is i got four matches in this week which is what i was looking for it would have been great to play five but ill go to new haven hoping to find a little more rhythm and build up to the open
4861953 there is a perception that the system we have today is inequitable because only 15 percent of all enlisted personnel and less than half of officers will ever receive anything in the system
4861954 this is a payment made for achieving a particular year of service
4861955 and within the services they would have the flexibility to vary this by year of service as well as by skill that way they could begin to shape the skills by dragging people further into their career by offering them an incentive
4861956 the separation payments would be made available by the service to members that they wished to entice to leave
4861957 therefore the recommendation of this qrmc is that the department of defense conduct a multi year test of this system
4861958 the way the test would work is this all four services would be asked to identify some skills that have different types of retention patterns some that stay not very long some that stay longer periods of time and ones they wish to influence
4861959 if someone was selected for the test they would be paid all of the tsp that they should have earned up until that point and it will be put in their tsp account for them
4861960 the programs vesting rules would in fact apply to all those individuals so should they achieve 10 years of service while they are in the test they would fully own it
4861961 hps 20b business consultant calculator isnt the sort of thing that would normally interest the average slashdotter but
4861962 its yours make yourself at home feel free to paint or remodel if you want
4861963 getting these oral histories now is important because once they are gone their stories are gone forever
4861964 this is first generation knowledge stories from the heroes who performed these missions told in their purest form
4861965 i love getting these guys they have such great stories and none of them are boring
4861966 you get so much out of these interviews you hear them talk and read their body language and get their emotion its pretty powerful
4861967 ive had guys get tears in their eyes and tell me that this is the first time theyve shared their stories
4861968 i had one vietnam veteran tell me i feel so much better
4861969 all of them love their country and are here for all the right reasons
4861970 the patriotism you see in these people is just phenomenal
4861971 commanders on the ground are making necessary adjustments to mitigate any of the impact of the loss of georgian forces
4861972 quite frankly these were good soldiers but weve been able to adapt at the battle space to account for their loss
4861973 i not only said it to russian prime minister vladimir putin ive said it to the president of the country dmitriy medvedev
4861974 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
4861975 i knew full well that i would be going to iraq
4861976 he is always ready for any mission he just says roger and moves out he is also very handy with tools he chips in wherever he can
4861977 most of the people are not here to do anything bad to us
4861978 things seem to be going great right now but there is always room for improvement
4861979 paving the road home the national behavioral health conference and policy academy on returning veterans and their families
4861980 this conference and policy academy is really designed overall to help states and territories and the think about new approaches particularly approaches that blend expertise and resources from multiple contributors
4861981 its going to provide framework to consider different approaches dialogue with colleagues and work toward a unified plan that they can take to their states to ensure that veterans have the mental health services they need and want
4861982 whether were from the federal government whether from state or local government the research community or wherever you come from today look for ways that we can address the needs that those men and women return with
4861983 whether were from samhsa or the va or dod we each have a role to play in addressing those needs
4861984 weve come up with a center of centers concept because weve realized that none of us have all of the answers
4861985 we brought in four existing centers that have been doing great work for a long time
4861986 thats why i personally appreciate the expertise and counsel as you formulate better mental care policies particularly to reduce stigma
4861987 stigma is a huge component in the inability for servicemembers to effectively seek support and care
4861988 it doesnt matter how good your opportunities are how effective your integration of community and and veterans affairs programs are if you dont open the door for participation in a way that men and women will walk through its not going to work
4861989 the mou is an agreement that standardizes policies and improves communication and it standardizes procedures so that air force lt
4861990 this makes sure the weapons on board the aircraft are secure while they are parked at a commercial gate
4861991 the mou allows the troops to get off the airplane and use the facilities in the airport if the stop is going to be for more than one hour its so they can be treated with respect
4861992 they understand the value it has and have a great appetite to stay ahead
4861993 well be looking to see where we can improve processes and where possible to inject technology to make them more efficient
4861994 for the young ones whether its going back to school or going through job training or starting a family or getting a job you can do it just like you can do it here playing these games
4861995 the starting point is that they are veterans and we are building on what they have learned as veterans how to work hard how to train how to figure out the way to get something done and then how to work together to make it better
4861996 by the end of the week i was so excited i was counting the days until the next one
4861997 when you get home any time you find yourself hitting a wall you can say i did the super g slalom and made it all the way through so i can do this too
4861998 not everyone is an athlete but what you experience here can help you through any challenge that comes your way it really does make a difference in your life
4861999 i love coming back and enjoying the camaraderie here we all feel like family catching up
4862000 its one of the big things ive gotten out of these games
4862001 i got to meet a lot more of the new people and spend time talking with them
4862002 its great being around people in similar situations and being able to share stories and network everybody wants to win but being around here and getting to learn from each other is inspirational
4862003 sure when the chairman of chrystler does it i will too
4862004 i am new but get used to me in this capacity
4862005 they understand the value it has and have a great appetite to stay ahead
4862006 well be looking to see where we can improve processes and where possible to inject technology to make them more efficient
4862007 ive set an arbitrary aggressive target of 25 percent cost out of the supply chain

4862010 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
4862011 look at me my face is next to a plant im so pretty
4862012 you have to know that they wanted to make a statement in this game playing against us and they did they sent a message to everybody in the tournament
4862013 they didnt do it before and now everybody knows theyre for real theyre very serious about this
4862014 when we can get a stop on the defensive end and get out and run until you get out on the court with us you cant really understand how fast we are as a team
4862015 i dont know it means nothing it means that were 4 0 but weve got to continue to play better
4862016 im the leader of the team so ive got to make sure theres no slippage
4862017 we didnt shoot the ball well against greece from the free throw line or the 3 point line but we shot 45 percent from 3 12 of 25 and almost 80 at the line so thats a plus
4862018 we know were going to defend we know were going to get fast break points but when we can shoot the ball from the outside like that and shoot free throws its going to be tough for anybody to beat us
4862019 there will be only one dream team that was a long time ago
4862020 i like defense so forcing the number of turnovers we did was the most satisfying thing for me
4862021 defense is always our bread and butter always where we like to start our basis from
4862022 when were playing good d were going to get out in transition and were going to run because were creating turnovers and forcing miscues weve got to be proud of how our defense stepped up and shut those guys down
4862023 im really proud of the way we came in focused beginning to end
4862024 we are all on the same page and when were all on the same page were hard to beat
4862025 guys are getting into a rhythm and like ive been saying were going to play our best basketball toward the end of the whole thing i think were kind of reaching our stride
4862026 they love us everywhere we go its like were the beatles
4862027 were going to need the fans if were going to win the gold medal
4862028 while our rich and much wealthier neighbors shun somali refugees and keep them out yemen one of the poorest countries in the world is one of the very few places that somali refugees are warmly welcomed allowed to freely move and work and have free health care and education

4862032 he was a real selfless pioneer who would push the envelope in art and technology without great expectations of returns
4862033 he didnt need to make a lot of money he didnt need to be famous he really just wanted to do great work
4862034 theyre taking care of him and were very grateful for it
4862035 people were passing out and getting physically ill we decided to end it before we risked turning into a horrible new story about how video games ruin peoples lives
4862036 if the new policies are not conducive to growth and development in the agriculture sector itwill decline and for the consumer that means imported product
4862037 it sends a strong message to farmers about their future
4862038 do we stay in farming or get the hell out of here and let the government buy the water back
4862039 however in several sub catchments there is no new water available at this point while we continue to better understand the system
4862040 obviously this has to be done in the context of managing the systems and environment so we get ahead of the game and dont end up being a murray darling
4862041 its sensible for the department of water to take a precautionary approach regarding over allocating water

4862048 but renting out its nonprofit brand name to a junk food chain is a major badge of shame for the girl scouts it runs counter to the girl scouts mission and this product and its marketing campaign deliver a very unhealthful message to young girls and others if you were designing a product with the intent of promoting obesity and type 2 diabetes in girls it would look exactly like the thin mint blizzard

4862068 were where we need to be defensively although we need to improve if we want to become a dominant defense then weve got to be better than we are weve got to tackle better we missed some tackles on the other side of the football were not executing very well were not throwing and catching though we had some guys out obviously with some injuries so weve got to continue to improve well get better as time goes on its a young group they will get better and better all the time i thought in our kicking game thomas weber obviously kicked extremely well what im excited about is how hes punting hes punting the ball extremely well i thought there was a lot of intensity but weve got a long way to go to be where we need to be
4862069 the guys that have been up here obviously know the tradition because theyve slept in those cabins it was nice we got together last night we ate had a good meal and then everybody watched a movie together then to come down here and practice and have a great crowd like this it was really worth the trip

4862100 acho at que tivemos uma boa atua o mas erramos demais a ltima bola criamos as jogadas e poder amos ter feito gols no primeiro tempo mas no finalzinho come amos a fazer liga es diretas e isso n o poderia acontecer
4862101 nossos volantes ficaram de costas para o zagueiro e a bola come ou a bater e voltar pois o herrera n o pode jogar virado de costas para o gol isso facilitou a marca o do am rica
4862102 pedi tranq ilidade e que mantivessem a organiza o foi o que a gente fez aceleramos um pouco mais e fomos criando at marcar o gol que nos deu a calma para continuar a partida

4862123 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4862124 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4862125 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

4862151 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4862152 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4862153 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4862154 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
4862155 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4862156 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
4862157 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4862158 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4862159 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4862160 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4862161 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4862162 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4862163 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4862164 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4862165 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4862166 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4862167 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4862168 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4862169 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4862170 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4862171 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4862172 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4862173 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4862174 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4862175 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration
4862176 mama this is the first time i have been pain free this medicine just might really help me
4862177 this is a wonderful medicine used appropriately but an unforgiving medicine used inappropriately
4862178 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
4862179 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
4862180 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4862181 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
4862182 we would have no reason to suspect that the dosing regimen
4862183 as soon as we became aware of deaths due to misprescribing for pain patients we began the process of instituting label changes
4862184 i dont think a drug that requires such a level of sophistication to use is what id call cheap because of the risks
4862185 given the medicines he was on his brain forgot to tell his heart to beat and his lungs to pump
4862186 i never had any idea of the risk nor did my husband
4862187 we know that a significant share of the methadone deaths involve doctors making well intended prescriptions
4862188 methadone can be important for patients when other drugs dont work
4862189 but unless the doctor has the training and resources to manage the patient properly hes going to get in trouble at a rate thats unacceptable
4862190 pick up your nearest book and go to page 123 find the fifth sentence and post on your blog the next three sentences acknowledge who tagged you and then tag five more people
4862191 i looked around at where i was and told myself there
4862192 as far as i know my grandmother never saw doctor who but i am sure she would have been intrigued excited and above all flattered
4862193 i wont come in and say i have a big agenda
4862194 i look forward to being a part of developing their visions and dreams and teaching them not only about entrepreneurship but also the significance of working to serve their community and uplift others
4862195 the american college is dedicated to offering programs that develop and refine the skills of professionals so they can serve consumers knowledgeably ethically and professionally
4862196 youre not going to be the best mom all the time
4862197 she was able almost in a dreamworld to remember her early life
4862198 the main thing i got out of it i could identify with native americans
4862199 this is not a contest about who can be a more avid aficionado of guns and ammo
4862200 sac state has a bright future and i want to be a part of that future
4862201 n o posso acreditar a primeira coisa que fiz quando cheguei a pequim foi deixar disposi o do comit antidoping todas as vitaminas e suplementos nutricionais que eu consumi durante a prepara o
4862202 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4862203 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4862204 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4862205 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4862206 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4862207 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4862208 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4862209 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4862210 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4862211 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4862212 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4862213 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4862214 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4862215 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4862216 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4862217 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4862218 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4862219 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4862220 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4862221 i think that most superdelegates including myself are going for obama
4862222 i made my decision for obama and im not switching again
4862223 my boss is totally conflicted about it and pissed hillary is putting us in this position
4862224 we still havent made up our mind and i dont know when we are going to
4862225 if obama cant stand up to the clintons how can he stand up to foreign dictators
4862226 the convention is about nominating barack so his people want to speed through the vote as fast as possible so it wont take too much tv time
4862227 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4862228 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4862229 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
4862230 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
4862231 do not forget to entertain strangers for by so doing some have unwittingly entertained angels
4862232 there have been inordinate delays in the negotiation process against the time frame provided for in the mou and the recent stalemate has further aggravated the situation
4862233 we believe that human rights democracy the rule of law and good governance being the principles upon which sadc is founded should be strongly protected and that sadc member states have an obligation to their citizens and the region to guarantee and protect these fundamental rights both zimbabwe and swaziland have failed to fulfill the fundamental principles of sadc
4862234 in view of the issues raised we the representatives of workers churches and ngos in the region hereby call for the restructuring and democratisation of sadc in order to respond appropriately and adequately to the challenges in the region
4862235 he was the most creative of the trumpeters from the ska period
4862236 i cannot be in a room with a latex glove
4862237 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4862238 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4862239 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4862240 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4862241 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4862242 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4862243 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4862244 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4862245 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4862246 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4862247 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4862248 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4862249 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4862250 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4862251 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4862252 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4862253 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4862254 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4862255 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

4862262 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4862263 some farmers are just completely walking away from their crop because its so badly cut and bruised and mangled up
4862264 its very difficult to pull our equipment and the second point is that with all the rainfall weve had more potential for fungus infection
4862265 i suspect the crop will be a good crop it will be flavorful large juicy and nice and sweet and tender

4862268 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4862269 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4862270 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4862271 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4862272 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4862276 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4862277 friends of mine that happen to be very different in leadership style philosophy and background
4862278 how do you view the role of judges and how do you plan to implement your judicial philosophy through court appointments
4862279 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4862280 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4862281 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4862282 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4862283 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4862284 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4862285 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4862286 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4862287 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4862288 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4862289 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4862290 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4862291 who are open to doing something on the production side
4862292 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4862293 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4862294 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4862295 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4862296 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4862297 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4862298 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4862299 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4862300 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4862301 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4862302 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4862303 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4862304 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4862305 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4862306 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4862307 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4862308 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4862309 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4862310 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4862311 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4862312 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4862313 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4862314 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4862315 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4862316 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4862317 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4862318 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4862319 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4862320 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4862321 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4862322 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4862323 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4862324 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4862325 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4862326 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4862327 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4862328 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4862329 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4862330 good friends good books and a sleepy conscience this is the ideal life
4862331 i have no special talents i am only passionately curious
4862332 no disrespect meant but i think that you need to solve this problem a script like mine needs to assume that people are managing their images carefully
4862333 without men like him we wouldnt be a nation one fourth of a barrel of oil gets turned into something besides fuel

4862341 la desigualdad que complace a la derecha por ser vista como espejo del dise o natural indigna a la izquierda como arbitrariedad de la historia

4862345 if the new policies are not conducive to growth and development in the agriculture sector itwill decline and for the consumer that means imported product
4862346 it sends a strong message to farmers about their future
4862347 do we stay in farming or get the hell out of here and let the government buy the water back
4862348 however in several sub catchments there is no new water available at this point while we continue to better understand the system
4862349 obviously this has to be done in the context of managing the systems and environment so we get ahead of the game and dont end up being a murray darling
4862350 its sensible for the department of water to take a precautionary approach regarding over allocating water
4862351 they concluded rationing was the only way to achieve dramatic cuts without feeding inflation or causing social unrest
4862352 would improve on the system preventing black markets in unused coupons
4862353 we didnt want to be a burden for taxpayers this is not just a question of preserving a pristine wilderness says pete rose a goldman sachs spokesman this is about using 21st century science to preserve a pristine wilderness
4862354 if companies are running out of top line growth they have to generate growth from elsewhere
4862355 if they can put two and two together take out costs and come up with five then that is good enough for us
4862356 can anyone trust private equity any more how many times have they put something on the table and then just walked away without following through if a private equity firm wants to do a deal now i would like to see a 10 per cent deposit in the bank before anybody starts talking
4862357 share for share mergers allow institutional investors to participate in the upside
4862358 some company boards are reaching the conclusion that its worthwhile to take strategic value now
4862359 for someone thinking about selling a business the question is this do i continue to operate or do i cash out at a premium value and let others assume the risk
4862360 there are still many cases where buyers and sellers cant agree on value shareholders and boards expectations of value regarding the companies they hold have generally not fallen as much as traded equity values have
4862361 governments if they endure always tend increasingly toward aristocratic forms no government in history has been known to evade this pattern and as the aristocracy develops government tends more and more to act exclusively in the interests of the ruling class whether that class be hereditary royalty oligarchs of financial empires or entrenched bureaucracy

4862363 today was done covertly 25 years ago by the cia
4862364 this commitment not only moves us forward in meeting our renewable goal its also a significant step forward in the renewable energy sector
4862365 these landmark agreements signal the arrival of utility scale pv solar power that may be cost competitive with solar thermal and wind energy
4862366 our solar farms are quiet and emission free with solar panels mounted near ground level to minimize visual impact implementing cost competitive solar power on this scale establishes thin film photovoltaic generation as an important contributor to global sustainability
4862367 today high efficiency photovoltaic technology is a competitively priced component of utility scale peak power generation
4862368 we design our solar systems to maximize energy harvest while adapting to the natural topography of the site and serving the needs of the community
4862369 its always tough when you beat a good friend but i havent felt this way in singles since 2004
4862370 she took every opportunity she had to come in and make me play one more shot or one more passing shot
4862371 thats the way it is i got four matches in this week which is what i was looking for it would have been great to play five but ill go to new haven hoping to find a little more rhythm and build up to the open
4862372 weve been close before i dont know if we would have been able to get by tony or not he was pretty quick
4862373 the car was awesome all day there were a couple of cars that were real fast tony and brian vickers but my pit crew just did a great job there at the end i dont know what kind of problem tony had on pit road but it was sure a lot easier to pass him there than it would have been on the racetrack
4862374 weve certainly had more than our share of good finishes here and it seems like its a track where we always race well
4862375 you dont want to come across greedy but im getting sick and tired of not winning one of these races
4862376 we feel like every race weve been in weve led but we havent led the right lap
4862377 i really feel like it was the power difference between the ford and the toyotas with the new restrictor plate carl just got too far out ahead of us at the end and we didnt have enough time
4862378 i never thought it would be such a big deal but it has been its not like ill never see these guys again but i know this is the last time im going to work with this particular group of guys
4862379 sing a song about our independence day here in america
4862380 im actually going to pull a jonas brothers real quick
4862381 i just have so much fun when i think that they work there and i work here
4862382 its a story its mostly about my family and some people i saw in the airport
4862383 well after a birthday song like that i think a banjo would put he back in the right state of mind
4862384 well i think for boots birthday we should play a little tuba
4862385 prepared to play the drum solo that would change ashland coffee amp tea forever
4862386 boots is going to teach you a dance that we worked out with the jbs the jonas brothers
4862387 i hope youll join in with boots because its his birthday if for no other reason
4862388 this songs doesnt require boots nor kit its stephen kellogg and the nothing
4862389 thanks these are canadian boxers we got them as a group so we each have a pair
4862390 youre in a place like this and you brought your own sandwich
4862391 birthdays are like vacuums theyre there and then they suck and when theyre not sucking theyre there waiting to suck
4862392 sorry next year ill get you one of those cards with a rainbow on it
4862393 wouldnt it be funny if you challenged boots and zac too a game and kicked their asses and then wed have to fire boots and hanson would have to fire zac
4862394 im going to do this song alone and then well see if they come out
4862395 well it wouldnt quite be a party without a tuba
4862396 yea time just went by so slow since last night
4862397 i stayed at my friend andis house in maryland last night it took us two hours to get there after the show then i had to be up early to get my train back home that took another two hours and i live an hour from here but i made it
4862398 yea i watched a hannah montana concert on tv once and it wasnt that bad
4862399 shame on you kit i watch the show on disney but i couldnt sit through her concert
4862400 so stephen i heard you went to a jonas brothers concert
4862401 if you had to chose between a jonas brothers concert or a hanson concert which one would you pick
4862402 i know he has a baby now and hes busy but whatever were all busy
4862403 oh dont worry we have something up our sleeves for the fall tour
4862404 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4862405 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4862406 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4862407 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4862408 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4862409 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4862410 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4862411 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4862412 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4862413 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4862414 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4862415 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4862416 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4862417 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4862418 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4862419 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4862420 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4862421 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4862422 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4862423 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4862424 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4862425 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4862426 it was unreal going to work every day and seeing people lined up in the mall waiting to buy from us
4862427 this is what a portable electronic device should have been all along
4862428 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4862429 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4862430 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4862431 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4862432 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4862433 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4862434 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4862435 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4862436 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4862437 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4862438 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4862439 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4862440 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4862441 theres little to fault with the t6 powerplant virtually no turbo lag a wide torque band and being an inline six its ultra smooth
4862442 non so pi se ti amo o no ma io verr a firenze saremo pi vicini non sono entusiasta
4862443 there were dramatic elements to their lives that made them cinema worthy
4862444 somebody like philip larkin did nothing exceptional except write this small body of exquisite poems which made him a very famous poet other than the fact he was a misogynist and had weird affairs theres probably not much of a movie there
4862445 it is said of him that he was provincial a little england poet
4862446 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4862447 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4862448 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4862449 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4862450 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4862451 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4862452 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4862453 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4862454 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4862455 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4862456 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4862457 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4862458 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4862459 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4862460 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4862461 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4862462 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4862463 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4862464 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4862465 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4862466 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4862467 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4862468 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4862469 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4862470 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4862471 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4862472 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4862473 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4862474 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

4862481 are we being lied to about georgia as we were about iraq
4862482 if americans dont allow child labor or eat dogs how come we buy from a country that does
4862483 we need to set an example in here for all the kids who sit in the gallery and watch us work
4862484 here we go again telling us how to live and how to die and the very people that are most for this amendment are about 50 pounds overweight
4862485 leave us alone let us die the way we want to
4862486 it is gross and as a health issue you cant defend it its unhealthy
4862487 the pipes still work when the pipes work theres nothing like it
4862488 we had to restrain the firemen from running around town with the fire trucks ringing the sirens everybodys just overjoyed nobody deserved it more than she its great
4862489 i thought from the very first bouts that they had she just came on confidant and did what she had to do
4862490 carol is the winner and so then is the whole family and so are we as a community
4862491 youre going through town and youre seeing probably 30 40 people wearing these shirts that has her name and beijing 2008 theyre red with the canada flag
4862492 canada is delighted to see them standing tall on the podium with the worlds best athletes
4862493 we are extremely proud of canadas olympic team competing in beijing each day our athletes exhibit dignity respect and dedication to their sport and to their country
4862494 now that we can stay out a little later it s easier to come up here
4862495 i think it s going to take a little time for them to adjust
4862496 on a payday weekend we usually get three or four calls a night from bentley s
4862497 he didnt take a second to allow me to come
4862498 to be from curacao and curacao being so small and the kids playing on a big stage like this i want to support them as much as i can
4862499 the only thing i didnt like today was when they were behind everybodys head was down
4862500 i think at that time and moment you need to push the other teammates to keep going
4862501 we are very happy to have the aircraft back and having a resource that is going to be available to support our ground crews during the upcoming fire season
4862502 i think that with the current prevailing condition there is a likelihood that theyll be used
4862503 obviously as part of the resources or a tool in the box that the firefighters on the ground have one of the options will be to use the aircraft
4862504 i freaked out the first time when i put my head in the water this is try no 2
4862505 one day we had some red tide but most of it washed out by the time we got in the water
4862506 it felt like a glob of goo but it made me swim faster
4862507 i was so close to the end of the race
4862508 even if i had to emergency backstroke i was going to finish
4862509 it can produce very strong winds so it can be very similar
4862510 it felt like a train was coming through the building
4862511 as que la fe es por el o r y el o r por la palabra de dios
4862512 obviously this hurts a lot duncan is a big part of our plans for 2008 but its part of the job you just have to accept it and move on someone else will just have to step up and fill in for him while hes out
4862513 is it a setback yes am i thrilled by the injury no will i be back yes why because weve got a great medical staff here at hindsight and theyre going to do everything they can to get me back out there as soon as possible
4862514 qa workers have always been valued less than programmers and this is a grave error
4862515 they are under appreciated and we need to change that starting right now
4862516 were discussing other creative options like having the qa workers incorporate basic scripting into their testing process this will give them a chance to grow their skills while contributing to the project
4862517 managers need to realize that qa estimates are firm and they need to honor those instead qa time is now being viewed as a buffer of time that developers have as extra cushion
4862518 when you cut into qa time the quality of our work declines sharply and who gets blamed in the end you guessed it the qa workers
4862519 at all costs theres never a good time to have a strike but some time are worse than others right now is one of those times just speaking for my company weve got 3 product releases scheduled to be out next month schedules are already tight as it is a strike would just completely blow us out of the water

4862550 the reason were sitting here today is because the road came through
4862551 it was the only way through the two counties after a flood that you didnt have to cross a river
4862552 when the military cut the road they werent just going off into uncharted territory
4862553 it looked very much like any other log home with a spinning wheel and a cast iron skillet
4862554 in the 1820s the cherokee nation was only a fraction of what it once was
4862555 then three things happened that were bad for the cherokees
4862556 the trail of tears really started on the front porch of every cherokee household
4862557 the worst conditions really were during the roundup when they used bayonets to herd them conditions were similar to civil war prison camps they werent quite as bad along the trip because they could travel and have food along the way
4862558 she was 13 and shed traveled with her family 1 800 miles

4862569 his wife ran the station there he built a hotel across the street and the stable set about where fayetteville city hall is today
4862570 the butterfield overland express was the first overland transcontinental mail by stagecoach
4862571 it was the longest stagecoach line in world history 2 812 miles the butterfield stage line was a major factor in the settlement of arkansas and the west before the civil war
4862572 troops march down the road and they encounter other troops thats where the battle happens thats what happened at pea ridge
4862573 the battle was there because of the road from st louis to fort smith everybody used the same road the army went up and down it many times going to the indian territory

4862578 it was so loud they could hear it in fayetteville and springfield it was the first thunder in the ozarks in march it was artillery
4862579 it was stocked full of food pickles sardines oysters eggs
4862580 they were eating not fighting and their ammunition train was far behind they had no ammunition
4862581 the wire road got more use in december 1862 union brig gen frances herron on his way to fayetteville passed the body of his dead horse lying there from a previous battle they used these roads all the time

4862591 i feel like the voters have a right to vote for a position
4862592 i do not feel like its fair a position be appointed i feel like this committee is basically taking away our right to vote for positions
4862593 i like power flowing to the people and more legislative power i like checks and balances and i think this is too much power in the hands of a small number of people
4862594 were just working to try and make a better county and not to try and get into a partisan argument

4862628 this is a critical time for our nation and the american people deserve to hear both candidates speak from the heart without interruption in a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light
4862629 the primaries proved that americans care deeply about the faith values character and leadership convictions of candidates as much as they do about the issues while i know both men as friends and they recognize i will be frank but fair they also know i will be raising questions in these four areas beyond what political reporters typically ask this includes pressing issues that are bridging divides in our nation such as poverty hiv aids climate and human rights

4862643 well the trading risks of investment banks are much more complicated than the simple mortgage loans of the 1980s this is totally different

4862645 the banks havent been willing to unload the investments at distressed prices
4862646 sometimes risk management requires judgment beyond computers which is hopefully one of the biggest take aways from the current credit melt down
4862647 banks have long contended that the costs of reserve requirements i e forgone earnings put them at a competitive disadvantage relative to non bank competitors that are not subject to reserve requirements
4862648 these measures should help the banking sector attract liquid funds in competition with non bank institutions and direct market investments by businesses
4862649 a depositor and his bank can somehow contrive between them to perform an operation by which savings can disappear into the banking system so that they are lost to investment or contrariwise that the banking system can make it possible for investment to occur to which no savings corresponds

4862656 it was a battle out there today i am so happy to win but wish i could have played a little better
4862657 i stopped that 64 degree wedge on the last hole on a dime pretty much thank goodness i had that club in my bag
4862658 then after jordan and i both missed putts on the first playoff hole i made a putt on the second to win
4862659 i struggled coming down the back nine but pulled it out in the end when it mattered
4862660 all i wanted to do coming here was make the junior ryder cup and i did that
4862661 i played a consistent round with no bogeys and that is definitely what i wanted to do i would have liked for a couple of more putts to drop and i left a couple short too
4862662 this is the biggest tournament that i have ever won
4862663 it is especially good because i was in the lead all four days i am usually coming from behind when i win so it is nice to win when i have been in front of everyone else
4862664 i was telling myself to be patient all day and the putts finally started dropping and i extended the lead
4862665 i came here to get into the junior ryder cup winning the junior pga championship was a huge bonus

4862896 madonna should be focusing on altruistic activities otherwise it can create a lot of negative publicity this is not a good time for her to be seeking any accolade for its own sake its far better for her to perform acts of altruism that are for communities and the benefit of the world rather than spend time on projects which will get her noticed just for publicity if she seeks no rewards and does work for the goodness of the masses she will reap great benefits saturdays lunar eclipse could cause a less desirable shift for the singer in her relationship with husband guy ritchie following weeks of speculation the showbiz couples marriage is on the rocks an eclipse on her sun does indicate a big year ahead for her possibly major shifts in her relationship with her husband and the role he plays in her life she may be relating to the world and seeking a deeper metaphysical life experience more than she is relating to her partner eclipses come in cycles the last time madonna experienced this particular eclipse cycle was when she met and became involved with her current husband guy ritchie the cycle before that one was when she and her first husband sean penn got divorced so her marriage may experience some challenges now

4862901 were professional racers and not qualifying for a race is probably one of the most horrible feelings in the world for anyone on a race team
4862902 everybody on the rockstar energy drink team works hard and theyre giving 110 percent and working to the best of their abilities i was never so ready to go as i was on that last qualifying run i just knew the car was going to go down the race track but it didnt
4862903 we knew we had to qualify at this race even if it was no
4862904 its not because theres nobody over here who is talented we have a lot of talented guys on this rockstar energy drink team but im very upset about this and i apologize to rockstar and all of my fans well just have to regroup and head to indy
4862905 this fram top fuel dragster is running good the car is consistent and the guys are doing a great job
4862906 we kind of went for it and tried something different during the friday night session and i think it hurt us qualifying wise that friday night run is normally so very important but were trying to get ready to do some stuff from indy on because were locked into the countdown
4862907 the points still matter and wed like to move up but i guess we have to do our own dirty work tomorrow and take out antron brown in the first round since he is ahead of us in the points no 2
4862908 hopefully larry dixon no 3 in the points goes out early and we can go some rounds but those guys are tough over there and were both matco tools cars
4862909 were going to go out there and try and win the first round tomorrow and take it from there the fram dragster has been very consistent and we havent lost in round one for quite a while so my job is to go out there tomorrow and make sure we dont lose in the first round again
4862910 its very disappointing about the showdown but it was in our own hands
4862911 we started the year in the lead our problem has been that were a top five car when the suns out but we havent been a top 10 car in the night sessions and it bit us this weekend
4862912 we can win if we qualify because the race is run during day time but
4862913 the good news is that in the war were qualified again we have a good chance to put some more points on the board tomorrow and stay in that top 10
4862914 i sure would like to close out the first part of the countdown to the championship season with a win though
4862915 thats the way it is i was thinking maybe i could get em on that white flag but we had the yellow it was just a little off at the start a little loose but it was real good at the end
4862916 in fact it matched our qualifying run in the good conditions on friday night so if were going to see race conditions with some heat in the track like we saw today i think were pretty ready and we have the champ first round
4862917 we are trying to sneak some stuff in here to test we wanted to make sure we got in the show so we left our normal setup in the napa dodge charger on friday on saturday we put in our experimental stuff the first run saturday 7 695 84 52 was i think a little bit of driver error were not sure why the car made a hard right hand turn when it left the starting line but whatever we did with the chassis we fixed it it went right down the middle in the last pass and it was a great run
4862918 its really a miracle the mother had taken no stimulants during ovulation
4862919 a little disappointed the fastenal dodge was definitely a top 10 car right up until we put that last set of tires on and it just got tight for some reason that was disappointing because it was a good car today it was better on the short runs than the long runs well take it and go on to bristol next week id like a top 10 today though
4862920 yeah again it wasnt a bad finish but i was hoping for more i think we deserved more but thats the way it happens sometimes it was good fun racing out there today this track whether its the nationwide series or the cup series i think it really produces good racing
4862921 oh yeah im always learning in these things for sure
4862922 im really looking forward to bristol ive learned a lot by driving the nationwide car ive driven the sprint cup car there for 400 laps with no brakes and i learned a lot with that too smiles well see what happens there im looking forward to it
4862923 we come here to finish and be the top raybestos rookie the 33 unfortunately was on pit road when the caution came out he had a great call all weekend qualifying second but were here to win raybestos rookie of the year with either dario or bryan clauson that should put us back up there landon cassill and weve got dario again next week and then bryan at the end of the year theyre both going to have 18 starts and the best man is going to win hopefully its one of our guys
4862924 yeah just one of those deals that happen in racing our camping world chevrolet was honestly really good all day i ran in the top 10 for the most part of the day it was a good day we just dont have the finish to show for it weve got to capitalize on it next week at bristol and try to put everything together to get it done its frustrating i mean the day started out good we qualified on the outside pole and run good for the first three quarters of the race its just one of those racing deals you cant really get mad at it its just one of those things that happen the incident there at the end we felt like we should have got the lucky dog and nascar seen it different that we didnt get it its one of those deals well go to bristol and try to capitalize on it
4862925 i learned a lot it gives me confidence that i can run on a big two mile racetrack up there under the right circumstances and the right car that i can run with em we proved that today and i think gained some respect from some of the other competitors well go back short track racing next week at bristol and get us a good finish
4862926 oh yeah i mean the last three races honestly i felt like weve run really well when ive been in the car that does nothing but help my confidence and gets the team around me and things like that its unfortunate its one of those deals the 6 car had bad luck the 99 had some bad luck i was kind of hoping to gain in the owners points which i think we did a little bit but we could have gained a lot more if we got the finish that we worked for
4862927 right now if everything looks good like i think it is were going to go to bristol not a very good day but still finished 24th so not a very good day and finishing 24th is not terrible for us we ran the whole race and didnt go but one lap down hopefully we got some heads turned out there and something coming our way we were just terribly tight all day laughs i probably could have been a little bit better i probably would have got two or three more spots but when you get into that youre racing with a lot of guys with a lot of money if our bad days are 24th maybe our good days will be top 10 thats looking up at least
4862928 i guess the first thing that says is that ive been racing quite a while
4862929 but remember these past couple of years ive been able to pick my schedule and there is a reason that michigan is on that list twice ive always enjoyed racing here its a big race track with long straight aways and plenty of room to pass
4862930 its a place where if you get your car set up just right you are going to have a lot of fun and weve had a lot of fun here hopefully well have a little more fun here this weekend
4862931 i think our qualifying numbers and speed speak for how the bike is running
4862932 the guys are doing a great job and the schumacher electric suzuki is running fantastic im just happy to be here
4862933 i couldnt have any more confidence in our suzuki than i have right now in all honesty crew chief steve tartaglia jason jones and tom patsis are doing a great job with this motorcycle we dont have any parts falling off and its been very dependable and im just looking forward to tomorrow i think were finally back on track
4862934 our crew chief todd okuhara is still recuperating from his inner ear infection and our clutch guy michaeal knudsen is still in the hospital after suffering burns in that freak accident here at maple grove on thursday everyone on the don schumacher racing team wishes him a quick recovery
4862935 phil shuler regular crew chief on the rockstar energy drink dodge did as good a job as he could tuning both cars with the help of alan johnson from the army team but the challenge was just too much and we didnt get it done
4862936 our chances obviously of making it into the top 10 for the countdown to 1 playoffs are over well just finish off the year by causing havoc for everyone else in the playoffs
4862937 weve run del worsham every run this weekend the way things matched up and then we raced him last week in the first round
4862938 from a strategy standpoint we opened the day up already qualified and with no risk of getting bumped so we put a brand new supercharger on the car without the ability to test when we have to opportunity to try some things out weve got to take advantage we smoked the tires but we learned an awful lot testing that supercharger for later down the road for our second run we went back to our set up that we knew we had to run on sunday and i think we were fourth quick fifth of the session but to do that in the heat of the afternoon those are the type of conditions that weve got to run well in tomorrow
4862939 we run del first round tomorrow but it doesnt make a difference who we run weve got to win to get into the top 10
4862940 ive been saying it all weekend and thats the bottom line nothings changed
4862941 del has got a great team over there and they are very competitive
4862942 certainly they werent happy about losing to us last week on a holeshot so theyre going to come to the line ready but were up for the fight and were looking forward to going rounds on sunday
4862943 dime con quien andas y te dir qui n eres
4862944 nuestro doc que est s en el palacio nacional de por vida santificado sea tu nombre por las generaciones presentes y futuras
4862945 i think its more the team effort weve made some changes over the past month and our cars are getting better weve run good on the road race tracks weve run good at
4862946 you can learn a lot of things about what changes to do to the car theres a lot of things that you learn outside of the car pit strategy and how the races play out i was talking to kevin harvick car owner the other day the first 20 laps when i started running these nationwide races seemed like it meant a lot then halfway through the race youre like that first half of the race didnt mean anything its time to race now so ive learned that too you want to maintain track position but you dont want to fall too far back through the field at the beginning you want to maintain as much as you can stay on the lead lap and be right there in that top 10 to top five range right there at the end of the race and it usually ends up being a pretty good day
4862947 you get up there and you race with the top ten or 12 guys and normally three quarters of them are cup drivers and when you follow those guys and watch their line as the tires wear out where they start changing their line as the run goes you learn a lot racing those guys and its a lot easier racing up there the air is a lot cleaner especially on the bigger tracks you get good pit selection when you qualify good and you usually get an opening all that stuff comes into play towards the end of the race its just been awesome its been an awesome experience for me and every time i get in the car im getting better and better and i feel like were making our cars better at the shop and were getting the team behind us and hopefully we can move up in owners points from where we started the year at

4863191 i ran after the slow moving vehicle and hopped onto it to take pictures of those men only to be pulled to the ground by one of them
4863192 they continued attacking me despite my plea for them to stop until a parti keadilan rakyat member came to my rescue
4863193 i cannot imagine what would have happened to me if i was not wearing my crash helmet
4863194 i tried covering the camera with my body to prevent it from being damaged but someone snatched it from me during the commotion
4863195 i shouted at them to stop hitting mohamad sairien but they attacked me instead
4863196 we cannot say who was involved in the attack but we have reason to believe that there may be groups who want to implicate us in the attack

4863199 a weak economy is not a good thing for commodities
4863200 once you get this selling momentum going its not going to stop easily
4863201 a couple of u s stock funds or even just one a total stock market index fund plus a foreign stock fund and a bond fund are all most people need to cover the bases
4863202 if you have more then eight funds you should slap yourself
4863203 how many funds should you have four to six should do
4863204 as a general rule of thumb the more complexity that exists in a wall street cration the faster and farther investors should run

4863216 they protestors saw our black arm bands they asked us to board the vehicle so that we could reach the venue on time it was our pledge to visit the village of slain leader and pay tribute to him

4863219 it is difficult for people who come from far flung areas to get their work done in a single visit
4863220 after that the negative period starts for the film industry
4863221 out of the fifty two fridays in a year 20 fridays are lost to these bad periods out of the remaining 32 most are booked by big banners leaving small and medium budget films to either clash against the big ones or release during unprofitable times

4863237 dads not been well hes only just managing really we took him on a family trip to italy earlier this summer but there were all these babies around which added to the stress he didnt cope well at all but he is better than he was and thats all we can hope for we just want him to stay around for as long as humanly possible
4863238 raising taxes will ultimately hurt consumers by forcing them to pay even higher gas prices and republicans will oppose them
4863239 largely more of the same failed proposals theyve been trotting out for months
4863240 designed to give political cover to vulnerable democrats who are losing ground
4863241 the democratic leadership should bring up a clean bill give the members a chance to vote up or down on whether or not we should proceed with offshore drilling and not insert any legislative poison pills
4863242 those would be provisions that they know will never be enacted and are added only for the purpose of killing the effort to open up the outer continental shelf to drilling
4863243 rehashes washed up garbage that didnt have the ability to pass this house and theyre going to try to couple that with limited offshore production
4863244 as for this being a bit short of statesmanship so what this is a vitally impotant issue ill use whatever tools are at my avail to reach a satisfactory conclusion if that means playing hardball amp doing something that attracts attention so be it

4863271 at the same time it is a dangerous state of things if doctrine is made to drive out precept and faith is held up as making holiness a superfluity sanctification must not be forgotten or overlaid by justification we must teach plainly that the faith which saves the soul is not a dead faith but a faith which operates with purifying effect upon our entire nature and produces in us fruits of righteousness to the praise and glory of god
4863272 do you consider 100 of regular church goers to be true christians
4863273 forsaking oneself for christs sake is not an optional step of discipleship subsequent to conversion it is the sine qua non of saving faith
4863274 that is the kind of response the lord jesus called for wholehearted commitment a desire for him at any cost unconditional surrender a full exchange of self for the savior it is the only response that will open the gates of the kingdom
4863275 i agree with you if by the term lordship salvation you mean anything to do with justification this is a blog dedicated to the true free grace of eternal life by grace alone through faith alone in christ alone
4863276 ive been doing this for what seems to be forever
4863277 i had a freshly minted harvard mba and was confident i could do just about anything

4863308 message im getting the error even if i fill out the comment form completely
4863309 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4863310 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4863311 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4863312 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4863313 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4863314 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4863315 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4863316 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4863317 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4863318 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4863319 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4863320 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4863321 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4863322 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4863323 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4863324 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4863325 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4863326 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4863327 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4863328 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4863329 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4863330 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4863331 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4863332 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4863333 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4863334 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4863335 at the heart of this discussion from my point of view is the need to more carefully recognize the very important difference between atonement and redemption and not to use them as indiscriminately interchangeable
4863336 the blame lies solely with ourselves if we do not become partakers of this salvation for he calls all men to himself without a single exception and gives christ to all that we may be illuminated by him
4863337 for to this end we toil and strive because we have our hope set on the living god who is the savior of all people especially of those who believe
4863338 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4863339 hey matt you dont need yell and curse at me
4863340 i have always done my dead level best to accurately depict the views of any man i discuss if ever i am in error i always make that right
4863341 if any such treatment s of these volumes exist by macarthur i invite matthew thats me and any ls advocate to direct my attention to them
4863342 you take a thread comment where i asked whether macarthur ever addressed ryries so great salvation which i had forgotten and was mistaken on and try to make the field upon which you will die
4863343 say fellas anyone here aware of whether macarthur has responded to ryrie
4863344 yes you are right i inadvertently misrepresented macarthur when i said he had refused to interact with ryrie i have read macarthurs book faith works but i had forgotten that he responds to ryrie in that book
4863345 macarthur appropriately distinguished between the two i e the positions of ryrie and hodges something you have failed to acknowledge
4863346 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4863347 this is something youll learn in time but when youre multi tasking eventually youll have a little voice or a feeling that just comes to you like oh yeah to remind you of all the things you have going on
4863348 oh no no we just meant economic sanctions against iran with this amendment not military not at all why would anyone ever think we meant to write the president a blank check to take over the world one economy at a time there are no secret deals between myself the president and satan nope not a single one remember i once was buddies with al gore by association then i too must be seen as a tree loving environmentalist right hey and even hillary voted for it and shes a clinton you liberals love clintons dont you im a very mild mannered peaceful man you can have total trust in me

4863353 i t is increasingly apparent that iran through the use of the iranian republican sic guard corps quds force seeks to turn the shia militia extremists into a hezbollah like force to serve its interests and fight a proxy war against the iraqi state and coalition forces in iraq
4863354 easily available off the shelf at places like radio shack
4863355 what we are saying is that within iran that these efp component parts are being manufactured within iran weapons and munitions are being manufactured that are ending up in iraq and we are asking the iranian government to assist in stopping that from happening theres no intent to do anything other than that
4863356 no evidence to suggest that the government in tehran is facilitating the smuggling of shape charges into iraq
4863357 i dont think we have any specific proof of iranians in our area other than reports we have discovered caches it has not been a lot we have seen some evidence of some weapons that were employed against coalition forces that were made in iran where they are coming from across the border were not sure
4863358 iraqs neighbors influence and are influenced by events within iraq but the involvement of these outside actors is not likely to be a major driver of violence or the prospects for stability because of the self sustaining character of iraqs internal sectarian dynamics
4863359 iranian lethal support for select groups of iraqi shia militants clearly intensifies the conflict in iraq
4863360 increasing number of advanced roadside bombs being not just assembled but manufactured in machine shops
4863361 stamped out as part of what was clearly an ongoing order
4863362 reassess their belief that such bombs were being built in iran and smuggled fully assembled into iraq
4863363 i have not seen any evidence and i dont think any evidence exists of government supported or instigated armed support on irans part in iraq
4863364 i suspect theres nothing out there and i intend to prove it
4863365 s ome military analysts have concluded there is no concrete evidence of a link
4863366 t he qods force itself we believe by and large those individuals have been pulled out of the country as have the lebanese hezbollah trainers that were being used to augment that activity
4863367 copying hezbollahs techniques in building roadside bombs and carrying out sophisticated ambushes

4863374 were here to show that it isnt just a bunch of old hippies from the 60s who are against this war
4863375 its time to lay our bodies on the line and say weve had enough

4863387 id hate to lose the majority but im telling you if we dont stand up to our responsibility maybe thats the lesson to be learned
4863388 the political reality is that the real targets of the outside groups should be republicans who have so far refused to join the overwhelming majority of democrats in voting for a change of course in iraq
4863389 unworthy because the end result is going to be shiite theocracy closely aligned with iran

4863405 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4863406 this is a planning took where all things are going
4863407 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4863408 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4863409 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4863410 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4863411 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4863412 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4863413 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4863414 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4863415 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4863416 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4863417 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4863418 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4863419 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4863420 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4863421 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4863422 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4863423 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4863424 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4863425 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4863426 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4863427 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4863428 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4863429 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4863430 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4863431 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4863432 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4863433 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4863434 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4863435 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4863436 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4863437 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4863438 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4863439 everyone at uconn would like to wish elena the best of luck
4863440 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4863441 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4863442 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4863443 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4863444 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4863445 as the economic slump begins to affect everything from food prices to mortgage repayments this research shows that financial worries are a source of stress for many
4863446 but people are making changes to the way they live like growing their own fruit and vegetables and walking and cycling more
4863447 not only is this evidence that people are adapting well to change but some of their altered habits are actually good for mental health
4863448 for many people particularly the younger generations this may be the first time theyve been surrounded by worrying talk of serious recession
4863449 by spending less people can help themselves avoid serious debt which can lead to feelings of depression and anxiety
4863450 but they need to replace shopping and spending with other activities they enjoy and shouldnt isolate themselves from friends
4863451 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4863452 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4863453 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4863454 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4863455 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4863456 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4863457 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4863458 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4863459 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4863460 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4863461 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4863462 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4863463 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4863464 this event shows the pipes work and that if you put on great programming that people want to watch then theyll show up
4863465 everyone of us who has visited here comes away with a deep admiration for the chinese people so much to admire here and so much to learn

4863473 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4863474 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4863475 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4863476 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4863477 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4863478 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4863479 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4863480 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4863481 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4863482 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4863483 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4863484 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4863485 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4863486 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4863487 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4863488 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4863489 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4863490 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4863491 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4863492 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4863493 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4863494 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4863495 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4863496 a cavity at the base of my spine became infected and i needed surgery the wound was 15 centimetres long and they had to cut right down almost to the spine to take away all the infected tissue
4863497 i needed three weeks off school and even now i have been only able to go to school for half days
4863498 i dont know when i will be able to exercise again but i am still being careful with my weight i havent put any weight on i have just kept it level
4863499 people are still seeing a difference and the bones across my neck are becoming visible now
4863500 poor lizzie has been through the mill but she has stuck at it
4863501 i think if she had been able to do the exercise we would be a lot further on than we are
4863502 but at least it has not put her back to the stage where she puts weight on and that kind of thing i am pleased and watch it are pleased it will be about another month before she can exercise again
4863503 her shape has changed and will change even more when she gets back into the exercise

4863576 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system

4863597 kevin has a big role to fill and hes still got a lot to learn in becoming a big playmaker for us
4863598 last year when we lost shockey we did some more four wide receiver stuff when we got into passing downs we put steve smith in the tight end position and let him do some of the things that we tried to do with shockey well see how we manage but hopefully a whole lot wont change and well still use a lot of tight end formations kevin will have to step up

4863603 weve been close before i dont know if we would have been able to get by tony or not he was pretty quick
4863604 the car was awesome all day there were a couple of cars that were real fast tony and brian vickers but my pit crew just did a great job there at the end i dont know what kind of problem tony had on pit road but it was sure a lot easier to pass him there than it would have been on the racetrack
4863605 weve certainly had more than our share of good finishes here and it seems like its a track where we always race well
4863606 you dont want to come across greedy but im getting sick and tired of not winning one of these races
4863607 we feel like every race weve been in weve led but we havent led the right lap
4863608 i really feel like it was the power difference between the ford and the toyotas with the new restrictor plate carl just got too far out ahead of us at the end and we didnt have enough time
4863609 i never thought it would be such a big deal but it has been its not like ill never these guys again but i know this is the last time im going to work with this particular group of guys
4863610 unless you get off to a really hot start you kind of feel like youre behind the 8 ball
4863611 sometimes you can start pressing too much and in golf pressings not really good to do youve got to let the birdies happen let the putts go in you cant really force them in i think its easy to get agitated the day after you made everything
4863612 where we are and where carl is even if carl stumbles and falls back its still going to take a low number sunday for somebody to win the tournament
4863613 i had so many chances today but i just didnt convert the putts like i did yesterday
4863614 ive played that hole terrible all week so ill just keep the trend going
4863615 at that point i got a sense that carl was still putting the pedal to the metal
4863616 so i had to make some more birdies i got back in the hunt

4863618 sooner or later our president is going to say or do something that goes too far and then it will start
4863619 what happened here in the last week certainly came as a shock not only to georgia but to a lot of others as well
4863620 a lot of people will as a result of this want to build a closer relationship with their western partners as quickly as possible
4863621 i would like to believe it will be russia because we are fraternal nations and have to support each other
4863622 russia will not disappear tomorrow as well as in a century or two
4863623 we will always wake up and it will be there not canada
4863624 the assumption of the post 1991 settlement has been that the old russia is in the past that it is not a country that invades its neighbors

4863637 as we anticipate the election of a visionary president of these united states in november
4863638 we must be keenly aware of the need to send to the congress men and women who share the vision of the president and the platform from which attempts will be made to enact laws and establish policies
4863639 we believe jim martin candidate for the u s senate and consistent democrat meets that standard and shares that vision
4863640 ive known jim martin for almost 28 years his integrity is impeccable he not only works for the middle class but he has a deep and abiding concern for those who are poor and locked out he will represent all of georgia

4863655 it is a heartbreaking moment in the spring of 2005 when i learned about the financial crisis facing codys i was excited to save the store from bankruptcy unfortunately my current business is not strong enough or rich enough to support codys of course the store has been suffering from low sales and the deficit exceeds our ability to service it
4863656 when i met codys 25 years ago i was a freelance journalist enraptured by its books and atmosphere it means so much to me and i apologize to the people who have supported codys for not being able to keep this landmark independent bookstore open codys is my treasure and more than that codys is a real friend of berkeley community and will be missed
4863657 today i apologize to you i could not protect codys i have done my best and spent millions but i am unable to keep this landmark independent bookstore open
4863658 in the spring of 2005 i was introduced to then owner andy ross and
4863659 unfortunately a short time after purchasing codys from andy my japanese operation was taken over by an investment bank the bankers drove me from my company and attempted to terminate codys
4863660 but my new operation is not strong enough or rich enough to support codys above all we have been suffering from low sales after opening our new store
4863661 i still have a strong desire to see a miracle i still hope we can fight back
4863662 i still feel that we need codys as the symbol of the fighting spirit

4863679 thursday is a conjunction not a square or opposition but the theme is the same tread carefully
4863680 well that song would have been fun to play at that show now im not playing in front of people any time soon blah blah blah
4863681 yes i was out of sarajevo when the war began
4863682 and i could have stayed out but i didnt feel i should i grew up in adoration of writers like hemingway george orwell anna akhmatova and that has always been my idea about the artist that you have to be a brave and freedom loving person also i like the idea of seeing something come from nothing the city was really destroyed at that moment absolutely in a terrible situation and i hope i created a few things that helped the city to begin to recover
4863683 i cant say how pleased i am to be part of this brilliant festival programme with the theme of artists without borders
4863684 because this has been a huge part of my life for the past 16 years this theme of borders reappearing borders being crossed and overcome
4863685 when i chose this play by nigel williams though i was thinking above all of the levels of violence in the lives of young people in bosnia today
4863686 so we have stories all the time of beatings knivings shootings even bombings there was a young boy who firebombed his girlfriends house and killed several people just because she wouldnt answer his text messages and what i feel about this play of nigel williams although it comes from a very different situation is that it deals very beautifully and powerfully with this theme of violence on several levels there is a very obvious and strong political and social level there is a complex and detailed psychological level and above all we have what you can call a metaphysical level because i think that in this play williams went to the very core or the source of human violence where all elements play together to create a violent event
4863687 so i called them up and invited them to come to sarajevo to be part of this project to beat up young people because of their songs i felt that was not permissible even in bosnia in the 21st century
4863688 and in this situation art comes into the role of waking us up changing the discourse and producing eros real creative and sexual energy rather than cheap images of it i always thought that theatre had to be truthful but now i know that we are also influential and frankly i dont find a lot of responsibility in the way some artists conduct themselves today i believe in the value of life and in the seriousness of ideas i am a zealot of seriousness
4863689 and i know that you cannot even do really good comedy without it people come to the theatre in search of a real encounter wiith other human beings and we must give them what they come for our capacity to do that is the measure of being human and if the price is that we sometimes say something not very pleasant well thats precisely why people want us in the end because we speak the truth
4863690 ive read all his material i like his approach historically with the middle east conflict hes got a very in depth understanding of conflict
4863691 time suck if you dont have what my friend kevin nations calls a

4863697 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4863700 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4863701 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4863709 wir lieben sie ber alles sie hat berhaupt nichts von einer b sen stiefmutter sie ist eine wunderbare frau und hat unseren vater sehr sehr gl cklich gemacht
4863710 wenn mein vater gl cklich ist bin ich es auch
4863711 ein mutterersatz waren die freundinnen meines vaters nie aber katja und ich verstehen uns sehr gut
4863712 man muss versuchen den kindern des partners eine freundin zu sein der versuch in konkurrenz zur mutter zu treten ist gef hrlich
4863713 ich musste erst lernen nicht mehr immer die nummer eins zu sein fr her konnte ich es nicht einmal ertragen bei einem partner die nummer zwei zu sein heute komm ich auch gern an stelle drei oder vier wenn die familie vorrang hat
4863714 allein der umstand der arbeitslosigkeit ist keine qualifikation f r einen pflegeberuf die pflege alter und kranker menschen ist zu wichtig f r eine solche arbeitsmarktstatistische scharlatanerie

4863721 ich halte berhaupt nichts von einer d monisierung russlands ich begreife russland als teil europas

4863732 the irish public have a very strange love affair with padraig
4863733 i hope that he has gone somewhat towards making them realise theres a lot of work that goes on in the background to get that as people say stare that look in his eyes
4863734 when tiger comes back not only will harrington need to win again but he will also have to win against tiger enjoy it whilst it lasts padraig my bet is that this major was your last major
4863735 i remember him starting on the tour and quite clearly you could never see this happening
4863736 he was a decent player but there was nothing to intimate that he was going to be a great of the game apart from his work ethic
4863737 i recall at the k club one year coming off the course at about 6pm i was heading out to the trout ponds with my fly rod and there was padraig on the chipping green i went fishing for a good two hours when i got back he was still out there chipping this has become a theme throughout his career he works and works and works until he cannot work any more that is why he is a great
4863738 you know i said it before theres guys that get a little bit fortunate they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way
4863739 what im not going to do is get on the 16th hole and try to hit it 40 yards left of the green i mean thats not the way i play
4863740 the police and militia have such stony faces they are scaring the foreigners
4863741 my seven year old daughter knows her father congregates with a family of similar friends who seem to gather in his computer sometimes he talks to them even if nobody else can see them
4863742 most of what i know about writing fiction i learned by running every day
4863743 both my wins have come from the front but i will take where i am right now
4863744 its just lovely to be in contention going into the final round
4863745 i had food poisoning yesterday was sick in the night and didnt sleep much i feel ok now but ive not eaten anything and didnt feel comfortable with my swing
4863746 i think ive put myself a littlebit too far back but if i win ill change my mind about taking next week off
4863747 i want to give myself every chance of course you can feel pressure playing at home but i think its more inspirational
4863748 sometimes i drink red bull thats only when im desperate when i need some serious artificial stimulation
4863749 a work in progress by a life in progress is the third play ive written and in it i really wanted to talk about different things such as getting older
4863750 after edinburgh im going back to new york to do the celebrity apprentice the donald trump show with my daughter
4863751 im still enjoying life as much as i did the showbiz life is great everybody wants it everybody enjoys it theres no way im slowing down
4863752 i just do what ive got to do whatever happens in your life youve just got to keep yourself in the day and let it take care of itself
4863753 i came to do surviving spike after an agent passed me a script when i was sitting round a table at a social evening ive often done things not knowing if they would work out and then ive just added my stuff to it and it has
4863754 i am also a fan of spike which helps i interviewed him once on barrymore and he said to me youre off your chump i said thats rich coming from you
4863755 the play encompasses spikes depression as well so there are parallels with my life i suppose theres this misconception that comedians walk around smiling all the time so when youre not doing it theres just loss unless you keep yourself busy and then get that manic side of it when youre performing you get this flatness i get it sometimes i dont know where it comes from
4863756 i had actually retired for about the tenth time in my life
4863757 i have played the festival before but in the 1950s i was a dancer for a dance troupe and then i did it again a couple of years later
4863758 i think doing the festival might be good for ones career i do lead a different life living in america now but when i play here i can feel something inside me saying mmm maybe i should do this
4863759 i think a lot of people thought i was dead
4863760 its true that edinburgh is very good for your career the entire press depends on edinburgh but its absolutely pot luck as to what they see here theyre either tipped off by someone they know or just follow the course and really like it if theyre surprised by something new
4863761 i actually started my career at edinburgh in 1973 in a play called the thrie estates
4863762 its great as people are in a real holiday mode and they are all here to indulge in their filthy passion for theatre which is lovely ive found my audience to be very lovely and willing to be moved which is great
4863763 playing edinburgh has been great for my career to be honest initially i never dreamed of doing it as i didnt come up through the ranks of the art circuit but i was convinced to do it by someone i knew
4863764 because of the quick turn around you get to see your audience and i saw these people who had wonderful tattoos and piercings and looked liked they had come to see an original hazel oconnor show
4863765 part of my show is a kind of revenge in a comedy style aimed at the bastards that signed me to their record company i had real problems with them a few years ago
4863766 last year i did grumpy old women and my director for that show just asked me one day whether id thought of doing a one woman show
4863767 i had no intention of causing any kind of incident
4863768 it was conceived during this process and born during this process
4863769 lots of characters in your books change their sex is this some kind of wish fulfilment

4863775 it is the right of the georgian people and georgian government to determine their own security orientation
4863776 an armed attack on any member in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all and if such an armed attack occurs each of them will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith such action as it deems necessary including the use of armed force to restore and maintain the security of the north atlantic area
4863777 no one in the west who has seen what is happening in kosovo can doubt that natos military action is justified you need only ask anyone who has seen the tear stained faces of the hundreds of thousands of refugees streaming across the border heard their heart rending tales of cruelty
4863778 i think people in both the united states and in the united kingdom and elsewhere in western europe will have to ask very clearly how important is georgia to them
4863779 there was a lot of talk about how georgia should join nato and if only georgia was a member of nato this wouldnt have happened and so forth i think that is frankly totally unconvincing
4863780 the united states britain france and germany are not going to go to war with russia over south ossetia however sympathetic to the people of georgia we are
4863781 we are sympathetic to tibet we are sympathetic to zimbabwe but we dont contemplate military solutions to these problems so nato membership is not the answer
4863782 get your grubby hands of my half witted but nevertheless residually innocent daughter drummer boy
4863783 we cannot guarantee to regenerate every town and every city in britain that has fallen behind just as we cant buck the market so we cant buck economic geography either
4863784 if government efforts to help northern cities since the 1950s had succeeded then there would be no gap in living standards or employment or educational achievement or health
4863785 internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic economy
4863786 what florida residents would hope for is that the storm stays over land as much as possible but right now the forecast doesnt call for that
4863787 i hate to say major hurricane because the forecast is so uncertain but you folks need to be prepared
4863788 they should top off their vehicles with fuel make sure they have the supplies they need
4863789 certainly theyre going to have to get their things in order
4863790 right now its looking more threatening for the sarasota area
4863791 our thoughts are that this system will probably be somewhere on the north coast of cuba probably the straits of florida on monday and at that point it could intensify into a hurricane and ramp up pretty quickly

4863798 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4863799 as these additional security measures are taken the units of the russian armed forces that were sent into the zone of the south ossetian conflict will be withdrawn
4863800 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4863801 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4863802 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so

4863815 it means so much to me yall i would have never expected all these people to come out here
4863816 from the way i see it all these people here its out of the kindness of their heart they did not have to show up but they did just to help us out in the long run to show summer how much they care and love our family

4863820 she touched many lives in one way or another and its showing today absolutely people out here in the rain
4863821 we love all of them and we wanna do everything we can for them
4863822 gender is a groundless performance a kind of fiction that presents itself otherwise in appearing to proceed from a prior ground or origin
4863823 there are conventional gestures movements and styles which produce us as gendered even the colours of the clothes we wear as babies
4863824 all the worlds a stage all the men and women merely players
4863825 everyones gender is fabricated rather then expressed then everyone is in some kind of drag

4863829 names are words they can be re written like all words
4863830 they seek some way to achieve closure of a narrative that appears unrelentingly cyclical whose every end is another beginning and through which they are perpetually reconstituted in spite of themselves
4863831 i dont think you ever stop loving if you do you werent in love in the first place
4863832 history and fiction are themselves historical terms and that their definitions and interrelations are historically determined and vary with time

4863868 we will be gone at the end of the year
4863869 the public at large really does think why havent people moved on
4863870 theres also a population of people who have been very active in 9 11 recovery that know that this is very real
4863871 many donors in terms of mental health services begin to ask the question whether the trauma is really related to 9 11 anymore or not
4863872 i think many donors feel a sense of responsibility to make a one time response to this kind of disaster but rarely an ongoing one
4863873 this is where i learned to love the peasant the indigenous people and to admire their efforts to excel despite adverse conditions
4863874 let us rededicate ourselves to the military tradition of sacrifice
4863875 the constitutional role of the army is what it is a nonpolitical one
4863876 and the position of the army in all this has emerged with perfect clarity they are saying we are hands off
4863877 he came in at one point and said what are we going to do
4863878 i mean its his first time pitching here with the sox i can see that my guess is he probably didnt sleep very good last night because he already had the engine turned on and hell be fine tonight and then hell collapse after the game
4863879 i think hell be fine ive seen him as a hitter and im just looking forward to getting on the same page and getting people out
4863880 ele representava a cidade de chicago como s algu m que conhece bem as ruas e a sua gente pode fazer sua alma nunca se desligou de chicago

4863890 because im going out of state im going to take advantage of it all i can get
4863891 especially the people with less than three years on the job
4863892 the phone calls from the union hall and the people that weve talked to they are highly ticked off about not receiving that money
4863893 the hospitality here in north carolina has been magnificent to be attached to a golf tournament and have metlife be invited is a wonderful thing
4863894 and for snoopy to come over and take pictures of the course its just fantastic
4863895 if you were to visualize the airship upside down you would be able to see it resembles a submarine
4863896 and so like a submarine going over ocean swells or a big yacht or a boat going over ocean waves thats what it feels like to be in a blimp
4863897 up and down it pretty much just rides up and down over the waves naturally
4863898 the wind is our best friend and it can also be our biggest challenge so we are always watching the weather three or four days in advance to monitor the wind conditions and weather thats associated with it
4863899 dec 31 2004 wrap up of 2004 presidential election coverage

4863916 never doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world
4863917 who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies
4863918 a lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes
4863919 what does love look like it has the hands to help others it has the feet to hasten to the poor and needy it has eyes to see misery and want it has the ears to hear the sighs and sorrows of men that is what love looks like
4863920 everything has its wonders even darkness and silence and i learn whatever state i may be in therein to be content
4863921 i have found the paradox that if you love until it hurts there can be no more hurt only more love
4863922 should have left some standards in place to guide police and protect patients
4863923 gwyneth paltrow wont be the apple of her daughters eye if she continues to flaunt fur
4863924 its a terrible example to set for a young child promoting an industry that electrocutes animals snaps their necks and skins them alive
4863925 there is nothing feminine about inserting an electrode into the anus of a terrified and struggling fox and then electrocuting it ms paltrow is an actress and seemingly a particularly stupid one at that
4863926 gwyneth paltrow should be ashamed to promote something so steeped in animal suffering i can only assume that paltrow either is ignorant of the facts or lacks human decency and compassion
4863927 weve written to her many times and sent her videos showing how animals suffer for fur but have never received a response
4863928 animal rights groups are entitled to their opinion but many people do not share this opinion and it is certainly not reflected in the rising global demand for fur
4863929 regrettably not everyone understands the difference between animal welfare which has the full commitment of our sector and animal rights which seeks to ban every animal use by man whether for food medical or scientific research clothing or companionship
4863930 i never see anything so like this in my life i always remember this day

4863941 ossetians are running around and killing poor georgians this is a problem and we are trying to deal with it i have ordered my men to arrest anyone carrying out looting and other criminal acts
4863942 president medvedev informed members of the security council of the russian federation that he had signed the document on principles
4863943 ask the russians they are not following the agreement what do they want here
4863944 armed gangs of the abkhazian separatist regime together with units of the russian regular army shifted the administrative border of abkhazia towards the enguri river
4863945 were still in the wooden biplane era of cyber war it will get more sophisticated probably quite quickly the us has already created units for cyber defence so too has china no doubt russia and probably many others
4863946 if there had been a world wide web in the days of the blitz then the germans would have been attacking us on the net as well as from the air and wed have been doing the same back to them
4863947 for example you are physically attacked say bombed then someone screws with your emergency response systems making the situation worse
4863948 a malicious hack can be conducted by an individual or small group
4863949 it also provides a sneaky mechanism to states to attack and cause harm while avoiding retaliation because the identity of the attacker is obscured for instance if the republican of whatsistan launches a missile at you you know with a certainty where it came from not so with cyber
4863950 it costs about 4 cents 2p per machine you could fund an entire cyber warfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread
4863951 as the engine carriage came off the track it started spraying thousands of stones on to our carriage hitting the windows one was shattered as a stone came through it everyone was falling all over the place
4863952 yoo hoo young man i can still see your butt
4863953 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4863954 as these additional security measures are taken the units of the russian armed forces that were sent into the zone of the south ossetian conflict will be withdrawn
4863955 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4863956 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4863957 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4863958 is the setting just phisical or is it to do with attitudes expectations ect
4863959 who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life
4863960 for your sake we face death all day long we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered
4863961 british law enforcement has the tools to protect children abroad they just dont use them

4863967 before deciding whether to generate an ncd cms may consult with relevant beneficiary groups professional bodies and or manufacturers of the technologies in question using the public comment function available on the coverage web site
4863968 the public is encouraged to comment on potential topics and provide relevant evidence on whether a review should or should not proceed prior to the formal decision to open an ncd we are attempting to balance the publics desire to comment extensively on potential topics with the inherent resource and time constraints in the ncd process due to these resource and time constraints the public comment function available on the coverage web site will be the primary tool used to solicit input regarding this stage of the ncd process stakeholders bear the responsibility for reviewing the quarterly list and submitting comments or evidence that they believe to be relevant

4864281 how do you ask me to accept a lawyer when we have so many contradictions
4864282 you are the judge and i am the accused at the same time you are my enemy
4864283 those who kill for the state are as honorable as those who die for it
4864284 the ergenekon investigation is not addressing those dark times we think iller a ar and some other state officials from that time should be included in the ergenekon investigation
4864285 the raison d tre of the ergenekon case is the kurdish question without finding the people responsible for the murders in the kurdish region i am afraid there will be no healthy results in the ergenekon case
4864286 this is something speculative in order to convict someone of a crime there must be a direct link between the suspect and the crime but if the suspects are participating in these events from a second or third degree they can be held responsible too but this is not in the indictment
4864287 the court has to review every appeal the public prosecutors can also reopen the cases if they think there is new evidence that justifies reopening them
4864288 actually in the face of this new evidence the public prosecutors should reopen the case but we will submit our application to the court very soon
4864289 its going to make it more difficult for the eu to have a russia policy the war if anything has divided the european unions member states
4864290 this has ended medvedevs honeymoon with the west its clear that putin not medvedev is in charge we had hoped for a new start now we have a new start but of a different kind
4864291 the implications on russia are almost invisible it wont make russia any less attractive
4864292 i suspect that the divisions in nato will have deepened in fact each side will probably feel justified in taking the position in bucharest that it did
4864293 then i applied for a spot in the department of architecture at yeditepe university of stanbul but in the same year the headscarf ban began to be implemented at my university so i could not attend any courses
4864294 i am not offended by anything i cannot be alienated from my country for such things it is not something to be offended about in my opinion
4864295 as graduates of imam hatip high schools we cannot score high on the ss no matter how much we study and we heard that it was possible to transfer to an austrian university after being registered at a university in turkey but the transfer can only happen between departments of the same field of study so i was registered at a law department at maltepe university and studied there for one year in english preparatory classes since the classes at the university are taught in english
4864296 i went to vienna in 2002 and finished university last year
4864297 this year we brought 70 turkish children from vienna to turkey we traveled to stanbul bursa and anakkale

4864299 nobody could guess that saakashvili would defy the russian giant attacking south ossetia means attacking russia
4864300 turkey has followed a healthy policy by not supporting one side over the other
4864301 i dont think turkey could have intervened earlier and prevented this indeed i think the one thing turkey could have done and still can do is to provide genuine expertise to the new and often inexperienced governments on how to read what the west and especially what the americans say more established regimes know how to balance what washington says diplomatically with what it says publicly and politically had georgia been able to do that it might have avoided this problem
4864302 regional peace and welfare must be secured via cooperative projects that reflect common sense and mutual interests not sentimentalism clashes and tensions
4864303 since the mid 2000s turkey has become a force for solutions rather than problems
4864304 its opportunities include establishing far closer ties with azerbaijan and georgia and assuming the role of a major regional power its risks include falling into the trap of a cooperative venture with moscow something that would tie ankaras hands forcing it to sacrifice its interests to russias
4864305 the frozen conflicts have been internationalized russia has suffered a black eye diplomatically georgia has left the cis commonwealth of independent states and will get into nato as will ukraine and other countries in the region will become more independent of moscow as well
4864306 erdo an should be in regular touch with french president nicolas sarkozy and javier solana high representative for the common foreign and security policy secretary general of the council of the european union so they can work on a solution together
4864307 nagorno karabakh is only a short distance from the key baku tbilisi ceyhan btc oil pipeline where both baku and yerevan have been increasing their defense spending turkey could play a far greater role here again together with the eu before nagorno karabakh also blows up in the worlds face
4864308 the russians have demonstrated their military capability of getting very close to the pipelines and they have shown that they can easily blockade georgia
4864309 the georgian president brought in the whole pipeline issue probably to send more worries to the west and especially to european consumers so as to draw more attention to the conflict
4864310 its not that we should ignore it but its certainly not a reason to panic
4864311 stifling political expression pressuring influential media and targeting vocal critics and opposition leaders
4864312 turkish democracy should grow into a form that will not shut down political parties unless they openly call for violence the closure risk the dtp is facing is a serious test for our democracy disbanding this party will not solve problems in turkey what the ruling ak party and the constitutional court should do is to display a stance in accordance with democracy
4864313 closure of the dtp will neither solve the kurdish problem nor strengthen turkish democracy it will just bury these problems which will re emerge stronger at the first opportunity
4864314 we should stress at every opportunity that we are against closure of political parties which represent the will of the people the dtp may be criticized for its intra party policy but its closure will be no remedy to our problems
4864315 the closure of our party will mean the start of a new critical process for turkey i believe it will disturb the countrys peaceful atmosphere if the constitutional court decides not to disband the dtp it will mark a new era for democratic transformation in turkey
4864316 there are bargains being made behind the scenes in such political cases as we dont know the details of such bargains we cannot predict what the result of the dtp closure case will be in principle i am against the closure of political parties parties should not be shut down unless they call for violence and act in line with terrorist organizations a political party be it the ak party or the dtp should not be edged out of the political scene due to its ideology and opinions
4864317 they should state at every opportunity that party closures are not compatible with democracy they should strongly criticize closure cases regardless of which party is involved
4864318 ten of the 11 judges agreed that the ak party had become a focal point of anti secular activities and decided to deprive the party of treasury funds i dont find this verdict democratic a political party cannot be convicted for its ideologies what is more alarming here is that if the ak party is intimidated by the verdict and retreats its chain of reforms on the path toward modernization freedoms and democracy in turkey will receive a serious blow but on the other hand if it proceeds in working toward its goals then we can be assured that our democracy will be able to take steps forward
4864319 the conditions have changed a change is on the horizon in the form of a new constitution party closures are expected to be made more difficult with the new constitution thats why i dont believe our party will be disbanded

4864326 n no i just thought you know that you might feel uncomfortable

4864394 were still in the wooden biplane era of cyber war it will get more sophisticated probably quite quickly the us has already created units for cyber defence so too has china no doubt russia and probably many others
4864395 if there had been a world wide web in the days of the blitz then the germans would have been attacking us on the net as well as from the air and wed have been doing the same back to them
4864396 for example you are physically attacked say bombed then someone screws with your emergency response systems making the situation worse
4864397 a malicious hack can be conducted by an individual or small group
4864398 it also provides a sneaky mechanism to states to attack and cause harm while avoiding retaliation because the identity of the attacker is obscured for instance if the republican of whatsistan launches a missile at you you know with a certainty where it came from not so with cyber
4864399 it costs about 4 cents 2p per machine you could fund an entire cyber warfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread
4864400 i just thought jesus but then i also thought i really want that gold medal
4864401 they were all magnificent they did exactly what they had to do win that race the kept their nerve which was most vital and they dug down and found things that maybe before this they didnt know they had
4864402 these have been the hardest months of my career and my life but now they are the greatest the effort that came from our crew today is something i will never forget
4864403 i hope what i have done will show a lot of young people in britain that if you work enough you really can get your dream sometimes you sit by the side of the pool and think it is just too hard to go on but then you know that there are great rewards down the road if you persevere i certainly know that now
4864404 yes saudi intelligence chief prince muqrin bin abdul aziz did visit pakistan on friday and met senior government officials
4864405 the main purpose of the visit was to find an amicable solution to the impeachment issue and that no one should become a laughing stock
4864406 maybe before he might have thought about stepping down but not now
4864407 after all this hard work and watching what i eat i just fancy a burger and some chips
4864408 i cant do fish im terrified of what might be underneath me
4864409 i went over to see mum and dad in their seats afterwards and the crowd just mobbed me
4864410 it was a bit weird everyone just went whoosh towards me its not really sunk in i spoke to one of my sisters in mansfield and the press are already outside the house
4864411 im absolutely stunned at what beckys done today i cant believe what ive seen this week two gold medals and shes broken the world record by so much
4864412 its totally unbelievable i feel like someone is going to pinch me and ill wake up
4864413 i watched a bit of csi miami in the olympic village to try to take my mind off the race
4864414 my nerves were really bad when i got to the pool i had to keep lying down because i thought i was going to be sick but as soon as you dive in the only thing you think about is the strokes consistency and telling yourself dont mess this up
4864415 shes a mansfield girl and shell stay a mansfield girl
4864416 i predict she will endorse sportswear for the likes of speedo
4864417 its beyond expectations tonight is a fantastic night and one im going to remember for a long time
4864418 im very emotional but im trying to keep a cap on it because ive got another race ive got to take it one step at a time its a three day event i need to get a good rest and come back with fire in the belly for number three
4864419 hoy is now scotlands most successful olympian as well as one of our best ever athletes

4864421 to extricate the masses of the people from the dire straits in which they find themselves we must over this weekend putr zimbabwe on the right road
4864422 the authorities in harare should not be represented at the political level at any sadc summit as that would be equal to giving them legitimacy
4864423 ossetians are running around and killing poor georgians this is a problem and we are trying to deal with it i have ordered my men to arrest anyone carrying out looting and other criminal acts
4864424 we were the unlikeliest lot and that is precisely why god has chosen us
4864425 the president informed participants of the security council meeting that he had just now signed the six point plan
4864426 the head of our state has made it clear that the georgian side appearing in the future as peacekeepers is now after what has happened unacceptable to south ossetia
4864427 the russian president issued an order to the relevant authorities to start the adoption of extra security measures envisaged in the six point plan
4864428 as these security measures are implemented the withdrawal of forces sent to carry out this reinforcement operation will be carried out
4864429 the document signed by the georgian president differs from the one which was agreed
4864430 it totally omits the introductory part saying that these principles are supported by russia and france and calling on all sides to sign them
4864431 thank god ive moved farther away where nothing like that could happen
4864432 please give me a good home i dont have pet dander or pee on me i am practically new but my owners cant take me to santa fe

4864764 who cares what he thinks of burns paxman is a short man with a long face

4864822 neils arrest came as a result of extensive coordinated work between interpol and police in several countries first to identify vico as christopher paul neil and then to bring him to justice
4864823 most importantly the arrest and conviction of neil a canadian for the sexual abuse of children in southeast asia demonstrates that interpol will use all available legal tools including obtaining media and public support to track down these predators wherever they may be found
4864824 what operation vico also shows is that keeping our children safe from sexual predators in the 21st century can best be achieved by ensuring that local national and international police co operate across borders and across the digital divide worldwide
4864825 i used to go over to have lunch with doris and jim and i would sit across from jim at the kitchen table and think before me is a true american hero
4864826 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments
4864827 they said a wife of one of the ss officers they called her the bitch of buchenwald saw a tattoo she liked on the arm of a prisoner and had the skin made into a lampshade i saw that
4864828 its important that we dont allow ourselves to lose him
4864829 its the memory of heroes like james hoyt and the memories of what theyve done that we must ensure that we keep alive and share with the current generation and future generations
4864830 mr hoyt as a young man saw unspeakable horrors when he was one of the soldiers to discover the buchenwald concentration camp and those are experiences as a country and a world we can never forget
4864831 you think back on a young man 19 years old and to have the experience that he had
4864832 a symbol of the chill blooded cruelty of the german nazi state
4864833 there is reason to believe that the prompt arrival of the 6th armored division on the scene saved many hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives
4864834 at the same time a group of russians just escaped from the concentration camp burst out of the woods attempting to attack the ss men the russians were restrained and interrogated
4864835 as guides to investigate report and rejoin as rapidly as possible
4864836 i took this side journey of about 3 km away from our main force because we kept encountering ss guards and prison inmates and the latter told us of the large camp to the south
4864837 we had been told by our intelligence that we might overrun a large prison camp but we or at least i had no idea of either the gigantic size of the camp or of the full extent of the incredible brutality
4864838 we were tumultuously greeted by what i was told were 21 000 men and what an incredible greeting that was
4864839 i was picked up by arms and legs thrown into the air caught thrown again caught thrown etc until i had to stop it i was getting dizzy
4864840 how the men found such a surge of strength in their emaciated condition was one of those bodily wonders in which the spirit sometimes overcomes all weaknesses of the flesh my but it was a great day
4864841 the worst concentration camp yet to be uncovered by west wall troops
4864842 seeing these things it changes you i was a kid
4864843 des moines had been the furthest id ever been from home i still have horrific dreams usually someone needs help and i cant help them im in a situation where im trapped and i cant get out
4864844 thinking back i would have pushed to be a psychologist if for no other reason than to understand myself better
4864845 memories of evil get erased for life must go on and new generations cannot be locked in the past but they would do well to remember the past
4864846 i have heard the questions of who is going to replace the injured superstars that were originally part of the tournament so tonight i have an answer for that question im going to replace them with the new comers
4864847 what about those of us who have earned spots in that tournament
4864848 how about by being the only superstar who has had matches and has yet to be beaten by pinfall or submission not to mention i beat you at the ppv
4864849 now as i was saying im adding brandon smiley patrick swain and jacobi james to the kings glory title tournament however my match against jacobi will be a 2 on 1 handicap match now you may be thinking that im abusing my power as chairman of the board but that is not the case
4864850 a champion especially the next kings glory champion should be able to overcome the odds and be victorious and tonight i will see if jacobi is championship material

4864856 la decisi n tomada por el estado es adecuada considerando la negativa por parte de yale para devolver un patrimonio que inclusive la national geographic ha reconocido como peruano
4864857 in my opinion this reflects reality because as far as i can judge not everyone believes the americans were egging the georgians on to cross the line many think president saakashvili acted with washingtons tacit consent but that he got no direct orders from the americans i also believe that unlike youngsters older people simply read more newspapers young people mostly go for the electronic media including the internet however as to the georgian leaders political and personal responsibility for what happened this was a clear case of genocide no doubt about that from a lawyers viewpoint however we still need ironclad proof of their guilt

4864866 para el poeta rebelde son indispensables dos cualidades rechaza dejarse prescribir las leyes del poder ya sea que usen la propaganda o empleen la violencia su decisi n es defenderse

4864893 what i witnessed in mali is such a giant leap forward that
4864894 u n c l e v i p s a celebration of guest stars
4864895 what is it that we know when we know a word
4864896 the phonological and morphological context for which it is used to bring out its syntactical and semantic meaning
4864897 our new environment for commitment and participation becoming irrevocably involved with and responsible for each other
4864898 fancy mumbo jumbo that bends logic in just the right direction to where people can get what they want without truly clarifying their main idea
4864899 they gonna give me what i want i shop here every day
4864900 shut up kale lets just make this as smooth a get away as possible and then he will be out of your hair
4864901 i plan on ending your little blood party unless you can tell me where i can find miranda
4864902 i said i came for miranda now where is she
4864903 miranda i dont have any clue as to whom you are referring
4864904 dagli amici mi guardi dio che dai nemici mi guardo io
4864905 the other party will somehow stop the passage of this bill
4864906 the sheer size of the protest called by a hindu rights group represents a political challenge for the government as it heads toward possible early elections in the next few months
4864907 malaysian indians have never gathered in such large numbers in this way
4864908 they are frustrated and have no job opportunities in the government or the private sector they are not given business licences or places in university
4864909 islam prevailed because it was the best social and political order the times could offer it prevailed because everywhere it found politically apathetic peoples robbed oppressed bullied uneducated and unorganized and it found selfish and unsound governments out of touch with any people at all it was the broadest freshest and cleanest political idea that had yet come into actual activity in the world and it offered better terms than any other to the masses of mankind
4864910 the great house of learning library in baghdad accommodated 800 000 volumes
4864911 every age must seek its own interpretation of the quran and the traditions
4864912 one of the major causes of muslim decay was rigid conformity to interpretations made in other ages
4864913 each generation guided but unhampered by the work of its predecessors should be permitted to solve its own problems in accordance with the level of its consciousness and the demands of the time
4864914 to insist on literal interpretation of the rules of the quran shutting ones eyes to the social change that has occurred and that is so palpably occurring before our eyes is tantamount to deliberately defeating its moral social purpose and objectives it is just as though in view of the quranic emphasis on freeing slaves one were to insist on preserving the institution of slavery so that one could earn merit in the sight of god by freeing slaves surely the whole tenor of the teaching of the quran is that there should be no slavery at all
4864915 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4864916 customer appreciation day is really an event for ourselves and our partners at the morale welfare recreation office and along with our vendors to show support for our customers and what they do in a day in day out basis both in terms of what they bring to us in terms of business but also what they do for our country by serving
4864917 despite whether or not you support the program or decry the process of its adoption it is a program that is being implemented in our school system and will contin
4864918 i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network that provides a new brand of superior programming that caters to all aspects of television from reality to original programming
4864919 we are thrilled to have a runner of shalane flanagans caliber participate in the cvs caremark downtown 5k
4864920 her presence will incite a special level of enthusiasm for the event this year
4864921 arrests have been made under the charges of waging war against the state and also for murder both unbailable offenses
4864922 this is where i learned to love the peasant the indigenous people and to admire their efforts to excel despite adverse conditions
4864923 the hope is that my children will find work and learn a trade to meet their expenses
4864924 lugo has good intentions but i dont know if hell be able to fulfill his promises in five years
4864925 we feel that nepal has found its hero for any epoch changing society we need a hero
4864926 after europes capitalist revolution napoleon came along to institutionalise socialism in russia lenin appeared
4864927 in nepal to institutionalise the federal democratic republic after 10 years of peoples war and mass popular movement prachanda is here
4864928 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4864929 were in talks with the parties in our alliance and hope to form a government in the next few days
4864930 the integration of the peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4864931 the maoists will try to bring in populist and radical economic reforms but financially they will have lots of constraints
4864932 he is a communist hardliner but now he has a responsibility to meet the standards of democratic principles
4864933 this is an acid test for him to prove his commitment to democracy
4864934 we would have liked to move ahead with the project
4864935 but we saw that the preparations are not yet sufficient and we instructed our energy ministries to carry out a more detailed work
4864936 undoubtedly turkey has allies undoubtedly turkey differs with iran on many issues but we would regret it if some would think that we do things because someone tells us to do so
4864937 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here
4864938 the international rescue committee is firmly committed to protecting humanitarian space and distinguishing humanitarian workers from any military employees
4864939 once again it turns out that the real decisions in this organization are being made between berlin and paris
4864940 saying that the union will have a common policy toward russia is laughable
4864941 historical experience but also from the interests of corporations that think they will make a lot of money in russia
4864942 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4864943 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4864944 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4864945 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4864946 with a passion for life a strong woman caught up in the torrent of historical turmoil and drowned
4864947 he could have testified but he just flew back stateside to his american family
4864948 we all knew he slept in the house many times the baby looks like the father
4864949 the south korean police and prosecutors hated her because she was the lover of lee gang kook and then of col baird and nobody could touch her they waited for their chance
4864950 they would send her right back to the torture chamber
4864951 there is no god but allah indian forces go back
4864952 weve all talked about it and laughed about it and in some cases cried about it and were all starting to relax now
4864953 it is very disappointing that the zimbabwean people do not yet have the government they deserve
4864954 but i understand why morgan tsvangirai and the mdc movement for democratic change cannot accept an agreement that fails to reflect the democratic will of the zimbabwean people
4864955 the meeting of the sadc countries this weekend offers an important opportunity for african nations to review the talks progress and demonstrate their support for this process i urge them to seize it
4864956 the outside world continues to watch developments in zimbabwe closely and with concern not least given the deteriorating humanitarian situation we will do all we can to help

4864972 i was bored and lonely not all this bullshit trying to impress the reader jargon
4864973 meant for penetrative heterosexual sex or that mouths anuses breasts feet or leather silicone vinyl rubber or metal implements are not meant for sex at all it is a myth that ovaries and a uterus are meant to birth a child when considering my own bodily form i recognize its potential as extending beyond its ability to participate in a normative function while my organs are capable of engaging with the narrative of reproduction the time based linkage of discrete events from conception to birth the realm of capability extends beyond the bounds of that specific narrative chain these organs can do other things can have other purposes and it is the prerogative of every individual to acknowledge and explore this wide realm of capability
4864974 the latest spectacle is an ivy league professor threatening to sue her students because she claims their anti intellectualism violated her civil rights
4864975 a while back a friend of mine a guy who does a lot of directing work was asked to shoot some rather odd film footage it was all brief scenes of people ignoring each other families talking on cell phones couples tapping at adjacent laptops everyone looking in opposite directions these vignettes were commissioned by a company that sells stock photos and video to various clients including in large part advertisers the hope was that footage like this would appeal to customers who need to visually convey a mood of modern disconnectedness leaving aside the bleak and omnipresent nature of the subject matter they could have just put a tripod on a random street corner i was startled to realize that stock photo and video purveyors actually create material in anticipation of demand id somehow failed to consider that stock pictures could be made not just found these suppliers of the worlds commercial imagery are making bets on what life will look and feel like in the near future which made me wonder what else besides an ongoing technological dystopia do they imagine waiting ahead
4864976 you could copy a book newspaper or photograph that you
4864977 we have completely isolated young people from adults and created a peer culture we stick them in school and keep them from working in any meaningful way and if they do something wrong we put them in a pen with other children in most nonindustrialized societies young people are integrated into adult society as soon as they are capable and there is no sign of teen turmoil many cultures do not even have a term for adolescence but we not only created this stage of life we declared it inevitable in 1904 american psychologist g stanley hall said it was programmed by evolution he was wrong one effect is the creation of a new segment of society just waiting to consume especially if given money to spend there are now massive industries music clothing makeup that revolve around this artificial segment of society and keep it going with teens spending upward of 200 billion a year almost entirely on trivia ironically because minors have only limited property rights they dont have complete control over what they have bought
4864978 i understand gabbys word choice as attempting to get at the issues of projection that we tend to apply to each other animals objets etc in general and in this case to children in particular
4864979 i read from your post the implication that if i
4864980 i honestly felt like i might throw up i dont think ive ever seen the of violence against women so disturbingly portrayed on an ad before
4864981 this highly disturbing wrangler jeans ad that seems to be saying

4864984 what went wrong how did we allow ourselves to follow the worst most dishonest most corrupt leaders in american history into the worst foreign policy disaster yet
4864985 despite the governments tough offensive against organized crime and drug trafficking violence in general this year murders have increased to the point that in just eight months weve surpassed the 2 673 murders we had all of last year

4865036 with that growth of nationalism and authoritarianism amongst some great powers in the world it war does shine the fact that we have to maintain strong relations with our friends and other democracies

4865040 what carl shot on friday was an indication of how the course is playing

4865042 the way im playing hopefully i can get off to a good start again and come out with a hot putter im hitting the ball nicely ive just got to get the job done
4865043 i was a little disappointed with my putter but i thought i played really good and handled myself well
4865044 it was probably the worst score i could have shot i had so many chances i didnt convert

4865059 although the declines in notices of defaults seem promising much of this can be explained by the actions of just one lender
4865060 ninety one percent of the decline in notices of default since april can be attributed to countrywide financial unfortunately this is more likely due to the challenges of integrating two companies the size of countrywide financial and bank of america than it is a fundamental shift in foreclosure activity

4865088 i was shocked floored that anyone with any sense of humanity could do that
4865089 thats awful i the person should be euthanized i feel
4865090 i think its a good idea because a veterinarian would know if the dog was sick enough to be euthanized
4865091 veterinarians know why a dog should be euthanized so why shouldnt they
4865092 i dont think these individuals would have taken their dogs to the veterinarian to be euthanized

4865095 gordon could come through the party conference have a successful relaunch and get back on track only to throw it all away by losing a by election in november
4865096 we should do it now before the mps are back at westminster if we lost in november with mps all back no one knows what would happen
4865097 he should do it as quickly as possible it is clear that the longer you leave it the more momentum the snp will get
4865098 we have run very successful female classes for a while now
4865099 but girls in the class kept coming up to me and saying that their boyfriend or brother or cousin wanted to take part
4865100 we decided to try out some mens classes and the response has been great
4865101 increasingly it is guys in their late 20s and early 30s who are looking to keep their bodies toned some people see it as a novelty and a bit of fun but most of them take it very seriously

4865107 but the point about it was that it actually reinforced that i was good at this there was excitement and a level of achievement
4865108 as time went on i found myself becoming more and more interested in social issues
4865109 i enjoy as much as anybody looking in art galleries at different things because it gives you a different perspective on life but i think we can do more with it than that
4865110 community art and how we use art as part of a regeneration process for communities
4865111 i come from a pretty straightforward working class community and i have shared the kind of experiences that people in those communities have why would that make me any less able to be a politician
4865112 actually i think it is an advantage because it does allow me to understand where people have come from and what their hopes and aspirations are
4865113 it doesnt sit at odds with a principled position if you take the view that communities shouldnt be abandoned to people involved in anti social behaviour that people should be able to see people on the streets and prisoners need to have staff in there working with them
4865114 i would hope that gordon and people around him will recognise that this is the first time every member of the labour party and all the affiliates have their chance to put their name on the ballot paper
4865115 on the one hand they are saying this is great but on the other they are saying where has the summer gone
4865116 i came into this knowing it was going to be tough i was very clear about what i was letting myself in for but this time around i felt the party needed a contest and i was determined to play my part in that

4865119 scotts health deteriorated quite markedly and you can see that from his journal it starts off as a very intelligent very well written and interesting piece of work but as it gets towards the end of his life it begins to fall apart
4865120 there was no doubt that his mind weakened and his writing suffered as a result of this
4865121 with his decaying powers and this compulsion to keep writing he produced these two final work there is absolutely no doubt that they are way below the standards of his best work
4865122 it is the ghost of genius wandering once its soul has left you can almost imagine what scott might have done had he been at the height of his powers
4865123 for all that scott repeats himself uses the wrong word and sometimes loses control of the shape of his sentences there is no mistaking the onward drive of his story
4865124 omission of a word substitution of another word reshaping the grammar of a sentence will usually resolve the problems
4865125 nearly 200 years after they were first written todays readers finally have the chance to read scotts very last pieces of fiction in whatever form they are encountered these are unique and moving texts by a master of resonant storytelling
4865126 had not lost his power to tell a good story
4865127 i think the publication of these two final books will provide a fascinating insight it will be great for scholars i am very much of the view that great authors should be published warts and all
4865128 scott is held in high regard all over the world and this will spark international interest we will definitely be getting hold of some copies of the new book and im sure they will be very popular with visitors
4865129 we were all ready to go donald wilson murray international holdings chief executive had negotiated it for months with complete confidentiality
4865130 everything was pretty much agreed and then i said look gentlemen before we do this can you tell me how youre going to run this club
4865131 im sitting there with all the legal documents in front of me and they outline their plans well carve this up well sell that off and after a while i said enough were not doing the deal we got up and walked out we took our papers and went out of the door it wasnt for rangers in my opinion they did not want to take the club forward in a football way
4865132 thats the closest ive come to selling a few hours last year in a nice london hotel
4865133 they must look at the financial underpinning the murray group has done at rangers lets be under no illusions its cost us 100m ill tell you this unless youre backed by proper cash this club will have to downsize there is an economic crisis out there
4865134 this event shows the pipes work and that if you put on great programming that people want to watch then theyll show up
4865135 everyone of us who has visited here comes away with a deep admiration for the chinese people so much to admire here and so much to learn
4865136 everyone who was at the velodrome was cheering him on and were extremely happy for him the win didnt come as a surprise though we expected him to do it as he has worked so hard
4865137 i cant actually believe it at the minute its so nice for the work to have paid off ive worked so hard for it
4865138 if the queen is listening to this two golds dame rebecca adlington dame rebecca adlington
4865139 we knew she had it in her she started strong and she kept it going all the way through everybody in the room was on their feet screaming and crying theres no word for the emotion it was absolute jubilation her face when she looked up at the board and realised what she had done was just fantastic
4865140 we will be showing the two races on big screens there will be a fireworks finale and then it will be back to the civic centre for a big party she has raised the profile of mansfield and as an individual she is remarkable she provides inspiration for other youngsters in the town
4865141 it is a proud proud day for us all we have seen the blood sweat and tears they have put in
4865142 i cannot believe this now it means absolutely everything to me
4865143 i had better get a good nights sleep to make sure i come back tomorrow with some fire in the belly

4865148 if any party is greedy we have agreed that mr mugabe will be president whilst i become prime minister
4865149 we envisage that the prime minister must chair the cabinet and be responsible for the formulation execution and administration of government business including appointing and dismissing his ministers a prime minister cannot be given responsibility without authority and be expected to deliver
4865150 shall be commander in chief of the defence forces of zimbabwe
4865151 the outside world continues to watch developments in zimbabwe closely and with concern not least given the deteriorating humanitarian situation
4865152 to help put zimbabwe on the right road to its recovery
4865153 we have been in fruitful discussion with the health and education authorities and we are satisfied that the programme to be rolled out across the country now is a responsible and ethically appropriate one
4865154 we wanted to make sure any support materials were appropriate in the catholic schools and we didnt want hpv and cervical cancer to be linked with artificial contraception the factual information about the vaccine and cervical cancer are still there but it doesnt promote particular kinds of sexual behaviour we had discussions about it we looked at various forms of words and came to an agreement it took some months
4865155 the hpv vaccination will only protect young women from two strains of hpv leading to cervical cancer it is critically important that young people understand the need to use condoms to protect them from other stis
4865156 this message should be highlighted and underlined please remember this injection doesnt protect you from sexually transmitted diseases or becoming pregnant
4865157 the moral position is being imposed upon them it seems a bit archaic to let the catholic church decide on this
4865158 the hpv vaccine is about saving lives and protecting future generations of young girls from cervical cancer
4865159 scottish government officials consulted with many stakeholders and undertook research with parents and girls to ensure the right level of information was included in the leaflet the scottish government is absolutely committed to promoting safer sex and we are taking forward our sexual health strategy respect and responsibility
4865160 no proper assessment has been done on the impact of the cut off proposals on agricultural production
4865161 the scc would obviously be concerned at anything that would cause food prices to continue to rise given the pressure that this is already bringing to bear on families across scotland particularly those on lower incomes
4865162 these products underwent extensive testing before they were allowed to be used initially there is no evidence they are injurious to human health
4865163 many are pesticides vital to the continued production of food crops in scotland the uk and most of northern europe the risk for food supply food security and food pricing is that if we lose these products then there is nothing there to replace them in the short term
4865164 the ability of scottish farmers to produce these crops will be severely undermined
4865165 when we lost a similar tonnage recently in the maize market in the us prices went up by 60 we can assume that there would be a similar price increase if eu cereal yields fall by 20
4865166 if these substances were banned and yields dropped we have to find somewhere to import the deficit from thats okay in a good year but in a bad year there is nowhere to go if you reduce grain supply the price will go up
4865167 the commission proposal would affect only a few substances which are the most problematic ones for human health and the environment
4865168 farmers use different products every year to ensure that resistance doesnt build up reducing our armoury could be catastrophic and we are working hard to make sure that european politicians understand the severity of what is being proposed
4865169 reporting my rape was one of the hardest things ive ever done i was intimidated and embarrassed by the system by police officers asking personal questions like my bra size and asking if i drank a lot
4865170 i had to have photos taken of my naked body and the injuries and at times i felt like i wished i had never started it
4865171 at times i felt like it was my fault but i was determined to fight for some kind of justice and i think a lot of women give up before that
4865172 i would like to be included in the expert group on sexual crime or even if they would take a written submission from me
4865173 i volunteered to be an expert on rape once before when they were looking into bringing specialist experts into court rooms i was told i couldnt but i think i am pretty expert on it
4865174 i knew nothing about rape when it happened and thats the thing most people dont i would like to help women know more so if it happens they have more options
4865175 i think its absolutely vital to have the centres i couldnt have done this without them i couldnt have even managed to file the report with the police
4865176 all the doctors and nurses have experience of working with rape victims so they know how you might react your injuries and they make you feel very normal and safe
4865177 if i took the money it would have been tainted
4865178 i thought 25p in each pound will say you did this to yourself whatever i bought with it a quarter of it would make me feel terrible
4865179 in my mind they were telling me i was partly responsible for being raped
4865180 i knew getting a review from the criminal injuries compensation authority would take another two years and it had already been dragging on for four years since it happened and i didnt know if i was strong enough
4865181 but i was so angry i just wanted someone to listen and im glad i did because weve revealed something the cica was doing that was really immoral
4865182 people think women have one default setting which is to drink themselves into oblivion
4865183 you can have a couple of glasses of wine and be fine as i was but the first thing anyone would say is youve been drinking as if you have somehow brought it on yourself i think its really unfair
4865184 people think women are a lot more liberated than they are
4865185 people may be good at sport but may not have chosen the sport they have the potential to be best in
4865186 there is a lot of chance involved when people take up sport and most stick to what they stumbled across in school and may not have had the opportunity since to try out different things
4865187 some may never have tried rowing or sailing but find that they are absolutely right for them the testing programme will give us the opportunity to find out what people are capable of we hope to find some of our olympic medallists of the future
4865188 we got an e mail at university about girls4gold and it seemed too good an opportunity to miss
4865189 i just want to see whether i have the potential to become an olympian and it is not often you get the chance to mix with olympic athletes and coaches
4865190 i have always had a sport on the go and endurance is probably one of my strongest points i like the idea of cycling and as i have already done swimming that could be good for the modern pentathlon fencing swimming running pistol shooting and show jumping you never know i might have hidden talents
4865191 i was quite surprised to be picked but it would be amazing if i could go on from there because i would love to be an athlete
4865192 i just might not have found the sport im best at as yet
4865193 girls4gold is a fantastic opportunity many people dream of representing their country or taking part in the olympics
4865194 this is the best opportunity some will get to make it come true
4865195 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps
4865196 its rare for a whole team of sierra leoneans to go abroad and come back
4865197 it goes to show what sierra leone can do when it puts its mind to it we have managed to stick a feather in the cap for the country
4865198 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
4865199 until now our ability to represent the high latitude oceans and sea ice in oceanographic and climate models has suffered as a result
4865200 it picked him up so to speak and the car was left back at the crossing
4865201 i guess you could say he had an angel looking out for him
4865202 in terms of preventing the spread of infection the most important and effective method is hand washing whatever the organism people should be washing their hands after touching each patient the problem is that some hospitals do not have adequate facilities for handwashing which is one of the issues highlighted in the report into vale of leven
4865203 staff have been told that they could use alcohol gel instead of washing their hands
4865204 that is not a good message to give people they should be told they should wash their hands but a lot of wards have dispensers when they should have more hand basins
4865205 what would make sense would be for hospitals to remove the dispensers and replace them with adequate hand washing facilities in wards and clinical areas
4865206 by and large no i suspect its because staff have been told that they can use alcohol gel rather than washing their hands and they have come to the conclusion that they are being told that because it is effective
4865207 very effective at disinfecting hands and killing a whole host of bugs and germs
4865208 hand gel provides healthcare workers with a quick method of decontaminating their hands between healthcare interventions and facilitates higher levels of compliance with hand hygiene
4865209 it is important that staff patients and visitors not only wash their hands with soap and water but combine this practice with the use of alcohol based hand gels
4865210 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here but if something were to happen id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is okay because we were able to protect them
4865211 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started
4865212 why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves
4865213 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorisation of the institution
4865214 one accident and i dont know how the school board would live with themselves individual school boards should not the type of power to be able to do this
4865215 this is a disaster waiting to happen it is right up there with the worst ideas in the history of modern education
4865216 we could end up arming half the gangs in houston
4865217 this is the type of decision that makes texas a laughing stock both nationally and internationally
4865218 it is foolish to introduce more weapons into the school environment
4865219 in the event of a crisis there is no manageable way to integrate armed staff into the crisis response plan
4865220 gun control extremists may despise it but this is a common sense approach to the potential of school violence
4865221 thankfully in this country we see guns as a dangerous problem and not as a solution
4865222 one of the least reported and most scandalous features of the khartoum regimes domestic policies
4865223 national wealth and power to further enrich itself and its cronies while the marginalised regions of the country suffer from terrible poverty
4865224 it does have the potential to be the breadbasket of africa
4865225 smallholder food production goes down commercial food production goes up and food relief serves as a subsidy to this transformation keeping the displaced alive
4865226 in a meeting about the credit paper of standard grade maths examiners agreed there was a degree of difficulty that was necessary and intended
4865227 they assured themselves all the elements were in the curriculum but there was a recognition that the paper had been perceived to be difficult so the grade boundaries were adjusted accordingly
4865228 it would be unfair on pupils to be disadvantaged by sitting an exam in a year when the paper was particularly difficult
4865229 while setting the same level of difficulty in exams can never be exact from year to year the processes that are in place help to ensure that the system is as fair and consistent as possible
4865230 its absolutely critical to retain numeracy standards particularly around the lothians there is a very strong base of financial sector companies not even just companies but headquarters of companies
4865231 the area where there is a real worry which impinges on standard grade is the number of primary teachers who are not confident in numeracy because they dont need higher maths to go into primary teaching
4865232 we are now in peace time why should we be blowing up bridges when our job is to restore

4865234 but he quickly recovered his language skill we had private time just between the two of us

4865237 we didnt want to be a burden for taxpayers this is not just a question of preserving a pristine wilderness says pete rose a goldman sachs spokesman this is about using 21st century science to preserve a pristine wilderness
4865238 if he fails to decide to quit within the next two days the impeachment process will take its course
4865239 president musharraf is confident about defending himself in the parliament and defeating the charge sheet easily because whatever he did he did in the interest of the country and for the nation
4865240 this should be clear to everyone as impeachment is a constitutional affair and that could only be done through the parliament
4865241 fco the foreign office contacted me about that mathers proposed meeting and i re supplied the lines about this being a matter for uk ministers
4865242 the article said that jim mather would meet norwegian ministers to discuss in october so i suggested that our post in norway should make sure that their opposite numbers were clear about uk responsibilities
4865243 the generation transmission distribution and supply of electricity are reserved matters under the scotland act 1998 as are international relations it is for the uk government to take any decisions and deal with other countries in relation to those matters
4865244 berr is proving to be the single biggest obstacle to scotland fulfilling our renewable energy potential not only have they refused to act to counter unfair connection charges imposed on generators in scotland over a period of years now they are actively undermining the building of transmission systems
4865245 this memo consolidates berrs reputation as the worst department in the uk government a failure as far as scotland is concerned the uk government rakes in oil billions but gives nothing in return it is the department that likes to say no to scotland
4865246 we are very lucky to be positioned in an ideal area our main customers are the west enders young affluent professionals
4865247 they recognise the higher quality of items that we are looking for and are also willing to pay that little bit more for things they want to buy
4865248 sometimes people come in with shabby binbags but when you open them up they are full of designer clothes
4865249 we know our market and just wont bother putting out clothes that we know wont sell because of that we dont bother with primark or asda george clothes as they are not what our customers are looking for
4865250 the money raised by the shops is crucial in helping us fund projects in over 70 countries around the world
4865251 its very exciting its like an indiana jones adventure its searching for a lost underwater tomb
4865252 our objective is to find and protect the wreck because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have
4865253 there are 43 indictees out of 45 that are already sent to the hague
4865254 make sure that general mladic and hadzic are found and given a chance to defend themselves
4865255 i hope and i will suggest that sooner rather than later we are going to be able to announce that this chapter is closed and that there are no more indictees
4865256 the term cancer covers a wide range of conditions with variable presentations variable rates of biological progression and varying complexities of diagnosis and treatment
4865257 for patients with squamous carcinoma of lung and a potential doubling time of less than two weeks a 62 day target is clearly inappropriate
4865258 the initiative does not provide the most appropriate measure of cancer care and has serious flaws particularly in the damage it has done to clinical audit of treatment and outcome now is the time to refocus attention to quality of care and clinical audit rather than waiting times
4865259 its written by clinicians who are actively managing patients with cancer and these are our clinical concerns
4865260 tells us where patients are in the system and thats a reasonable thing to want to know
4865261 we are a friend of all people in the world even israelis and americans
4865262 we do not recognise a country called israel and so we cannot recognise a nation called israel
4865263 if mr mashai does not have the political awareness that the israeli people are the same people who have occupied the homes of millions of innocent and oppressed palestinians and have created the army of the zionist regime he has no right to hold such a position
4865264 the university of oxford has no record of ali kordan receiving an honorary doctorate or any other degree from the university
4865265 we did have an incident which took place with a small number of people but the majority of people who have come here today behaved impeccably
4865266 we have thrown our weight behind this because we think theres a difference between free speech and free expression and attacking someone for the colour of their skin or their sexual orientation
4865267 the bnp stands for everything that we are not we are here as a trade union to promote unity for the betterment of working men and working women and the bnp stand for attacking those who have different colour skin from their own
4865268 i support the anti fascists the bnp should never have been allowed here in the first place

4865293 let the oppression create monotonous people people who spiritually and mentally vegetate and procreate according to their various false beliefs
4865294 let there be a system of understanding in the false religions to make them seem logical to the fellowships to separate the opportunity from those who are lost in non productivity and let this false logic serve as tokens to identify situations in progress in a confused fashion 1 15 and let there be understanding in the superstitions false religions that will allow the truly logical fellowships to be able to understand the enlightenment of reality that exist within the falsehoods

4865405 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4865406 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4865407 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4865408 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
4865409 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
4865410 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4865411 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
4865412 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
4865413 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4865414 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective

4865429 he feels better looks better in just the couple of days that hes been here weve seen a little bit of sense of relief when youre talking to him well just take it day by day and see how he does
4865430 ive been running very hard and have used some of my emotions and aggressions in my workouts
4865431 im feeling pretty strong i just want to keep reassuring myself that i have the means and the mind set to keep the weight off
4865432 you could tell that hes been working and looks strong and hes worked out just about every day since hes been back here
4865433 a few weeks ago was the first time i ever opened up to anybody about anything
4865434 its been tough im still going through a lot but im just trying to make it its been a big step for me
4865435 i wanted to let them know that i hope they still respect me and if they dont im going to do everything possible to gain their respect back
4865436 the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a marriage feast for his son and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast but they would not come
4865437 but when the king came in to look at the guests he saw there a man who had no wedding garment and he said to him friend how did you get in here without a wedding garment and he was speechless then the king said to the attendants bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness there men will weep and gnash their teeth for many are called but few are chosen
4865438 he has set his tent in the sun and he is like a bridegroom coming forth from his bridal chamber
4865439 your pain is my pain my wealth is your wealth your salvation is my salvation

4865443 ironically iraq may yet prove to be the source of our salvation
4865444 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4865445 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that senator mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4865446 has it come to this has the magical impact of george lucas original vision of star wars been reduced to the level of saturday morning animation
4865447 its a deadening film that cuts corners on its animation and slumbers through a plot that a makes us feel like weve seen it all before and b makes us wish we hadnt
4865448 we saw this in a theater full of kids and there wasnt a single moment that caused spontaneous cheering
4865449 ziro the hutt is perhaps the most bizarre character ever created in the series history yes including jar jar a jabba shaped slug who wears face paint and feathers the creature speaks english rather than huttese except that he she somehow has the accent of truman capote by way of eric cartman of south park
4865450 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally
4865451 the character was so bad so incredibly awful that it was a slap to the face it is many times worse than im actually describing this character was actually too much for me
4865452 after meeting ahsoka we really understand why he killed all the younglings id have done it with my bare hands she calls him skyguy which is amazingly annoying and he calls her snips
4865453 of course the anakin ahsoka relationship is made impossibly awkward by the fact that shes half naked and 12 and that theyre always in close quarters i dont need the force to see this fan fiction coming
4865454 rick ross orchestrated a brutal attack upon dj vlad carried out at his direction by his accomplices in retribution for media coverage of
4865455 painstakingly created his public persona to be that of a major drug dealer and gangster but is in reality a former correctional officer
4865456 ive been hearing things about me on your web site we gonna make a story we going to see each other we going to talk where are you
4865457 following a brief conversation between dj vlad and ross in which ross said we got beef ross accomplices who had surrounded dj vlad while he spoke with ross proceeded to strike and beat dj vlad in ross presence and without any protest on ross part
4865458 theres a time and place for everything and now is the time
4865459 i felt like there was no bigger event in hip hop at this moment than me and t i working together
4865460 it was always turmoil between our camp and his camp us as the bosses of our companies everyone is gonna follow our lead wed figure if it aint no problem and we dont have no issues no beef then theres no reason we shouldnt be able to get together and make music that was an executive decision that was made on both our behalves

4865462 i talked to luda and he said it was time to sit down do business make grown man moves both of them got albums coming out time to try new things cris did something for t i too that nobody heard yet its about to come out soon its a good move
4865463 its showing that once great minds set their differences aside they can make something happen
4865464 thats two grown men not two grown males grown men
4865465 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4865466 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4865467 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4865468 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4865469 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4865470 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4865471 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4865487 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
4865488 pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
4865489 its not in their interests to take less profit personally as well as from the point of view of the business all these perverse incentives drive the price up

4865491 una reinterpretazione pi o meno semplice ma sicuramente con un pizzico di follia
4865492 he was very good at where to go and through his progressions that was not a problem he was sharp
4865493 the completions the incomplete passes and things you look at the numbers and say he struggled theres reasons for things that happened each play he did misfire on a couple of them he had people in his face in a couple plays he couldnt step up
4865494 a quarterbacks back foot hits the ground for example hes supposed to cut the ball loose and the receivers not out of the break those are things that need to be corrected
4865495 we have a lot of things to work on and have to do a better job of getting first downs and extending drives we have to convert third and short and also catch the ball we have a lot of things to work on
4865496 we need to get on the same page a little better we need to get some of those easy passes in one on one coverage weve got to complete those
4865497 i just have got to complete the ball thats basically it i have to continue to keep working as a receiver corps we got to just get the team to keep working on the little things thats basically it but on my part my reads and everything were right
4865498 oh well i thought you meant this week so i came in you still want me to come in next saturday
4865499 well if we go to mcdonalds and theyre out of cheese they dont just say too bad
4865500 yeah which dont get me wrong can be a really fun distraction but when its over youre left thinking about the girl you really like the one that broke your heart
4865501 they need to know that what theyve done its appreciated whether you believe in whats going on politically or not you support the troops and you support these guys
4865502 we being the vietnam veterans of america if you look at it historically we were treated a little differently and we want to make sure that never again will any veteran be treated like that
4865503 theres smoke theres fire theres cannons theres people going down and even though theyre acting the wounds its all so real that for the moment youre there
4865504 alternative university teaching tactics and strategies necessary to force an end to this war
4865505 turn downtown into one massive reminder to the delegates and the public of what war looks like

4865507 those assets are unique and if you enjoy owning and running them youre not going to get another shot at it so im not sure why you would sell
4865508 if cablevision spends the money to upgrade the building that makes it more of an attractive property to someone
4865509 but there are some structural aspects of that building that just cant be solved
4865510 it adds some hours when you get a guy in here a little bit late it definitely adds some hours but its been fun its been a fun transition its been a lot of hard work the biggest part that goes into it is just the translation of the information the words and the phrases the plays are all the same most teams run the same types of plays its just what you call them
4865511 the big thing with brett is obviously he pressures the whole field hes been doing that his whole career we tell our guys all the time sometimes you have a route thats designated to clear the defense to take a safety out of position or something but bretts just got such a great feel that if he sees something maybe its the safety bite down on something hell throw the ball so everybody stays alive everybodys looking to get open and bretts going to find the guy thats open and get him the ball
4865512 he was good we tease him we say you know im a little bit fatigued like we all are but we tell him because youre old he laughs but hes doing good theres been a lot of things hes had to get acclimated to whether its finding the lunch room or learning the playbook or studying film and all that stuff but hes doing a really really good job im very pleased
4865513 i think the gunslinger tag is maybe a little unfair because hes got a great feel for whats going on and just sitting around and watching film with him or talking to him during the course of practice hell say hey i saw this guy push over on the back side vs cover 4 i knew i was singled over there thats something some quarterbacks have some quarterbacks dont he definitely has that ability to see things
4865514 i had to go back and review some of the things from my background in the west coast system but really not much other than being excited about getting him here and just working through the language issues
4865515 its just getting the stiffness and soreness out of the elbow to go on out there and pitch
4865516 after i threw in binghamton it was really good i had way too good stuff in binghamton it was silly stupid but bouncing back the next day the elbow was very tight very sore its just one of those situations where youre like man if i had to throw today it just wouldnt be the same
4865517 really the thing that i battled out there was just stiffness and a little soreness
4865518 when youve got that stiffness and you go to make a pitch its awful hard to add that extra late action to the ball
4865519 talkies are spoiling the oldest art in the world the art of pantomime they are ruining the great beauty of silence they are defeating the meaning of the screen

4865521 i am only a symbolic recipient but it is the organisation which has been awarded
4865522 it places a larger responsibility on me and i will ensure that more will be done
4865523 my understanding in talking to the family was he was advised by the judge that should he see her at school he should turn and walk the other way
4865524 we deal with a lot of the victims in these cases and were only too aware of the ongoing ramifications for the victims i have trouble understanding where the judges head is in all this
4865525 i think it is more urban im working with producers who are just amazing
4865526 id rather not but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to

4865528 id love to if i can find the right movie
4865529 were just trying to work it out with my schedule with the children
4865530 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
4865531 it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit but it was really cool and she was happy
4865532 britney and kevin wanted to settle but there were issues of how much time we wanted and there was an upcoming court hearing scheduled
4865533 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that

4865540 elect us give us power in the congress and we will end the iraq war
4865541 anyone with a conscience sending soldiers back to iraq or afghanistan for multiple combat tours while the rest of the country chills out can hardly be seen as an acceptable arrangement it is unfair unjust and morally corrosive

4865554 ross perot who at times treated john mccain coolly after the divorce
4865555 mccain is the classic opportunist hes always reaching for attention and glory after he came
4865556 i have never heard of what youre talking about i will put my hand on a bible
4865557 of course by all accounts the divorce was completely amicable after john and carol mccains divorce there was apparently some confusion about belongings that were roberta mccains but we understand the court papers were unintentionally filed and the matter never went further in the legal system it went nowhere and was of no consequence
4865558 had no knowledge of the suit he did not authorize the suit or participate in its filing
4865559 you can be sure that i talked to and got the permission of any client who is listed as a plaintiff
4865560 i dont think it took more than 15 minutes of his time
4865561 the fact that they dont remember it doesnt bother me
4865562 plaintiffs lawyers will routinely ask for significant damages to try and prompt a settlement
4865563 what possible difference could it make it was all 25 years ago
4865564 i wish him well but i dont talk to reporters
4865565 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4865566 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4865567 there are some in the galaxy who say earth is backwoods john
4865568 they think because theyve been around so long they know everything better look what weve done in a hundred years more than they have in twenty thousand if we had some generals with backbone at eg wed tell the empress where to get off
4865569 mom and dad want me to try and get into a university here but i dont want to be a farmer or horticulturist
4865570 you could be an officer if you join earth guard after college you know
4865571 or you might find something in college that interests you and choose to pursue that
4865572 its so hard to get into an engineering school though mari
4865573 i think i might have a way to help you with your grades
4865574 she needs a refurbishing do you want to help me
4865575 sure i have to tweak the plasma conduits realign the field coils and replate the hull in a few places
4865576 and that looks like you got real close to something going real fast
4865577 lets not tell your mom about the disruptor burns okay
4865578 come back in an hour so i can put this stuff away and change
4865579 no ones fished in here in seventy five years and theyve multiplied
4865580 ive seen eagles catching fish but i guess there are not enough of them to make a dent
4865581 do you think it has something to do with noahcorp
4865582 it might have been an old water intake thats no longer used this lake is man made you know
4865583 its almost a hundred and ten years old at least it follows that it was sealed in 1998
4865584 the complex has been here since 98 or so the history says at least the mansions and the lake
4865585 maybe it had to do with the forms for the concrete lining the lakebed
4865586 i want to measure the size of the bolts so we know what tools to bring down this afternoon
4865587 that will cut three seconds off your time to jump if youre going full throttle the beam has to be precise or you lose power
4865588 well first we size it to see if we have enough thickness left in the trialloy
4865589 then you take the micro finishing laser and hone it out taking only the material you have to while keeping the bore straight to two thousandths of a micron
4865590 i have to go call me tonight if youre lonely
4865591 i met him last night and i gave him my link
4865592 hes fun but id still rather be polishing plasma conduits
4865593 yes ive only read about the technique i told you we dont have the resources on earth noahcorp sponsors clinics all over the planet so kids who have engineering talent can get hands on experience the good ones get scholarships to asu i dont think noahcorp knows new korea exists
4865594 if you want to study hyperdrive design you go to asu noahcorp looks there first for all their engineers and they sponsor the school of engineering
4865595 why dont you do the other five conduits on your own so you get experience for the practical test i forgot i have to do a few things in the house
4865596 besides theres a ford dealer in new seoul i can get a new one sent in on the morning transport she waved and walked to the house
4865597 that didnt bother you when you had your tongue down my throat did it
4865598 forget that but the kid lives there ive been using a different identity since i dropped you off
4865599 alex she drives sanely and is respectful to her boss
4865600 im fine i just heard from an old friend thats all
4865601 id like to know your opinion of what transpired between them
4865602 but if the palace believes bradley somehow coerced the princess into taking the actions she did it might have serious consequences for noahcorp and the government
4865603 the princess ran away from home broke almost every space traffic law in the book and died trying to escape the imperial navy
4865604 it would be embarrassing to all concerned if the princess was found alive in earthspace ms lexington
4865605 please dont act so surprised i obtained a report before you did according to bradley he had been left for almost twelve hours on the asteroid before he was rescued ask yourself ms lexington why he was found with two airpaks one unused one only half empty an airpak only lasts for six hours under normal use and id venture a guess that bradley was only out there a little over three hours
4865606 im saying bradley was doing something other than waiting alone on an asteroid for eight of the twelve hours since the destruction of princess mia kims ship im saying that if i noticed the little inconsistency almost immediately someone at earth guard will too it only follows the iss will find out not soon after they have earth guard so infiltrated it is ridiculous
4865607 because you and i have to get bradley to tell us the truth about those eight hours
4865608 dont you want to know if the princess is alive and where she might be
4865609 shes helping me study for the entrance exams at asu
4865610 id rather you didnt get his hopes up he really doesnt have the grades to get into an
4865611 so he doesnt have the grades linda look where he lives if he lived on earth or sirat he would have been identified right away for his talent
4865612 we hoped he would get into one of the smaller schools but
4865613 but i was lucky enough to have a friend who saw my talent and nurtured it
4865614 hes never tinkered with anything except for that hover cycle
4865615 but they might not even send him an invitation to apply when they see his address on the list they will pass him up for a kid from an industrial world
4865616 if they dont hell at least have had some fun for a few days
4865617 john is just a friend a fellow hotrodder thats all i know what hes feeling when he repairs something puts it back together and it works when he turns it on
4865618 send him home for dinner in a little while will you
4865619 i just thought well ive never been with a spacer and i wondered if it was different
4865620 they are the same as we are physiologically and genetically i suppose that sex would be performed in the same way
4865621 im engaged to be married to one i guess a little rubbed off over the years
4865622 yes in fact i hope to apply next year i took this year off to get my head together after my parents passed away
4865623 there arent many asians on caledonia and everyone mistook me for a spacer
4865624 caledonia is on the fringes of earthspace and many spacers cross the border there unfortunately anti spacer sentiment is growing in earthspace
4865625 its not just the country bumpkins like us who distrust the spacers one day it might come to a head when enough people start to believe earth is supporting the lifestyles of the wealthy spacers people see what we have done since first contact and think the galaxy should be ruled from earth instead of sirat
4865626 do you think the imperial navy could pacify all of earthspace without the help of eg
4865627 a hundred years ago the empress could dictate terms to earth today our economies are too intertwined the empire depends too much on earth and the twenty thousand worlds that make up earthspace to open hostilities look at the shipbuilding industry where would the imperial navy get spare parts for all of the ships they bought from earth if the borders were closed
4865628 no on 8 really want to defeat this measure they would ask ward connerly to speak out on their behalf they might not like the man but they do have common cause on this one issue and shouldnt their goal be its defeat
4865629 no on 8 forces are more committed to defeating this measure than they are to sidelining a controversial conservative who shares their goal on this one issue

4865665 has changed a child from an irresistible force to an immovable object

4865727 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4865728 you can make these up to one week in advance
4865729 gosh and all this time i thought it was because producers want you to buy both the box set and the obvious title they left out no they would never do that would they

4865734 we wanted to help her learn about life too the apartment made it a lot easier when she was training to be a teacher at the university it eased our concerns about security but it also helped her learn how to own and keep a property and have the responsibilities that come with adulthood
4865735 it just ticked all the right boxes the university was on lucys doorstep there are electronic security systems its close to bus routes and the railway station and because the property is modern it doesnt require much upkeep
4865736 the first thing you notice are the french doors that open on to a balcony and the fantastic views over the town
4865737 the driving force is the mixture of company and social life as well as being close to the college and being near places for parttime work so near bars or coffee shops towards a city centre for example
4865738 in edinburgh a main student area is newtown although its not even close to the college the primary driving force of the area is that its where students have always lived and socialised so its where new students want to live as well
4865739 ignore new builds in city centres and buy good quality second hand homes in secondary locations you dont pay a new home premium and dont compete in a location over supplied with flats
4865740 incentives and assistance packages that the second hand homes market could never hope to match

4865755 es un mensaje a todos los antiguos pa ses del imperio sovi tico contra cualquier intento de profundizar su vinculaci n a occidente
4865756 yo he arraigado el destino de mi pa s en la ret rica de occidente sobre democracia y libertad
4865757 hay una lecci n en todas partes a las antiguas rep blicas sovi ticas recuerden su geograf a a la otan todav a quieren incorporar vendettas cauc sicas en su alianza a tiflis quieren conservar a un presidente que les trajo esto a washington la voz de rusia todav a cuenta guste o no cuenta bastante
4865758 rusia leg timamente se siente como una potencia acosada que experimenta actitudes de presi n pr cticamente en todas sus fronteras y que tiene que responder de una manera u otra a esa presi n externa
4865759 no creo que la situaci n cambie mucho aunque depender parcialmente de si las fuerzas de paz rusas son reemplazadas por fuerzas internacionales de otra manera rusia no las reconocer formalmente pues su inter s es mantener los conflictos en suspenso como una influencia til en georgia
4865760 success i did it i won an olympic medal everybody on winning a silver medal i am completely happy and still in complete disbelief that i was able to achieve this feat im not joking its a tough loss but im on cloud nine i congratulated phelps and his coach bob bowman im just glad the race was fun to watch for everyone it was a pleasure for me really
4865761 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4865762 the other half are going to tear this apart on how we won this race but i got the trophy and i got the points
4865763 i dont have good finishes at those race tracks couple of road courses pocono it is just typically not a good part of the season where we have run very good we are always strong at the races the first third and last third of the season
4865764 it would be good to get another win to show everybody we can do it on a full tank of gas
4865765 it would be a good to get a win anywhere but michigan is a good place because of the manufacturers being close being close to detroit motor city
4865766 get mad because you dont want to save you just want to run hard
4865767 it is a lot of work and you dont know if what you are doing is saving gas or not you dont know what you are accomplishing and its no fun
4865768 the first thing i need to know is how much fuel do we need to save
4865769 you cant tell the driver to save fuel with five laps to go in the race the information has to be fed to a driver as soon as that run starts
4865770 look were on the edge here the only way to save fuel is to go slower you de accelerate sooner youre off the throttle sooner youre on the throttle later and youre on the throttle less aggressively
4865771 by the way you still have to make reasonable lap times in most cases
4865772 were just trying to get better and we did definitely improve on road courses
4865773 but these bigger tracks we still are it seems like always about two or three laps less than what everyone else is im not a fan of the fuel mileage races i like the fastest car winning i dont think the fans like a crew chief race i think they like to see a drivers race
4865774 it depends on what side of the fence you are on man
4865775 if you are on the winning side you are happy dont matter how if you are the guy who had the fastest car all day you arent real happy about it
4865776 i have been on both sides of it everybody would like to just go out there and just outrun the hell out of everybody to win races sometimes you have to take them how you get them
4865777 weve been close before i dont know if we would have been able to get by tony or not he was pretty quick
4865778 the car was awesome all day there were a couple of cars that were real fast tony and brian vickers but my pit crew just did a great job there at the end i dont know what kind of problem tony had on pit road but it was sure a lot easier to pass him there than it would have been on the racetrack
4865779 weve certainly had more than our share of good finishes here and it seems like its a track where we always race well
4865780 you dont want to come across greedy but im getting sick and tired of not winning one of these races
4865781 we feel like every race weve been in weve led but we havent led the right lap
4865782 i really feel like it was the power difference between the ford and the toyotas with the new restrictor plate carl just got too far out ahead of us at the end and we didnt have enough time
4865783 i never thought it would be such a big deal but it has been its not like ill never these guys again but i know this is the last time im going to work with this particular group of guys
4865784 stewart haas racing has had and will continue to have discussions with numerous people regarding leadership positions within the team including crew chiefs for the nos 4 and 14 teams at this point no decisions have been made in regard to filling those positions
4865785 were working to not get just one crew chief were working to get a pair of crew chiefs that are going to work well together
4865786 it helps us work together better as drivers and keeps the organization just that much more intact
4865787 ive seen multicar organizations that the crew chiefs were in different directions with each other and they dont utilize the opportunity of what a two car team is all about in the right way
4865788 weve been in a lot of meetings in the last four weeks with a lot of different people from different organizations that have come to us wanting to be a part of this
4865789 joe has been a huge part of that you know its just talking to the right people
4865790 that just gives us that many more options and people to choose from
4865791 we are getting people hired we have commitments from people that were currently working on contracts right now that are some key people that we think are really going to be able to help us build this program
4865792 basically the network gets smarter and smarter the more data points it gets added to it
4865793 we believe well be able to do greater customization of campaigns
4865794 kids use im to talk to their friends and email to talk to old people
4865795 with an agent you know the paperwork is done professional tenants stay on average for 17 months but students move far more often sometimes during term time if theyre not happy or fall out with sharers
4865796 that means more checks contracts and dealing with deposits you dont want that if youre at the other end of the country
4865797 everyone at uconn would like to wish elena the best of luck
4865798 in an effort to respect the privacy of elena and the delle donne family
4865799 i realized that its ok not to want to do something
4865800 i have second and third thoughts and overanalyze nearly everything
4865801 so while things are not exactly perfect right now life is ok
4865802 years ago i used to think id never be happy
4865803 im still struggling with the idea of who i am and where im headed
4865804 i try not to obsess too much about the future just trying to enjoy the moments
4865805 i long for the chance to push the reset on my own life
4865806 i like to think in another life i own a small cozy cafe in the mountains somewhere
4865807 i feel like i am so many things and so few
4865808 president medvedev informed members of the security council of the russian federation that he had signed the document on principles

4865811 i would be surprised if not shocked if he doesnt tell me i need to get it the elbow fixed
4865812 i wouldnt come back from that kind of surgery right now
4865813 by no means do i want to go through another year going through what ive gone through this year
4865814 but at the same time i dont want my career to end this way either
4865815 its going right down the same road it was before
4865816 i know its not going to get better by just resting i need to fix it to enjoy the rest of my life and i need to fix it if i want to pitch again next year
4865817 its kind of a blessing that it happened right away

4865826 we dont have the david ecksteins of the world we dont have that guy so we have to do what we can
4865827 hanley gets a lot of extra base hits 29 this year so if he starts off the game with a double obviously im going to try to move him over
4865828 just try to play the small ball if he gets on second you dont want to go out there and try to hit home runs nobody is in here trying to do that were trying to play the game like its supposed to
4865829 kemenangan ini sangat berarti bagi semua apalagi negara kita juga akan berulang tahun besok hari ini jadi emas olimpiade 2008 beijing ini kami persembahkan sebagai kado ulang tahun republik indonesia ini juga jadi hadiah ulang tahun bagi saya kemarin juga kado untuk hendra yang akan berulang tahun pada 25 agustus
4865830 sungguh kami begitu terharu dengan prestasi ini apalagi sukses ini tidak kami raih dengan gampang terbukti kami kehilangan set pertama itu terjadi karena kami terlalu buru buru ingin segera menuntaskan pertandingan
4865831 saya melihat maria makin matang dalam bertindak saya yakin dia akan menjadi bintang di masa depan
4865832 mudah mudahan kami tidak terbawa lagi permainan lawan tentu kami juga akan lebih mawas diri demi meraih medali emas olimpiade
4865833 kami terbawa arus sehingga kami tak bisa lagi fokus tentu ini jadi pelajaran saat tampil di laga berikut
4865834 ive always said that the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability that assessment has not changed and when i go to iraq and have a chance to talk to some of the commanders on the ground im sure ill have more information and will continue to refine my policies
4865835 and senator obama your campaign manager david plouffe said when he is this is talking about you when he is elected president we will be out of iraq in 16 months at the most there should be no confusion about that so youd give the same rock hard pledge that no matter what the military commanders said you would give the order to bring them home
4865836 because the commander in chief sets the mission charlie thats not the role of the generals now i will always listen to our commanders on the ground with respect to tactics once ive given them a new mission that we are going to proceed deliberately in an orderly fashion out of iraq and we are going to have our combat troops out we will not have permanent bases there once i have provided that mission if they come to me and want to adjust tactics then i will certainly take their recommendations into consideration but ultimately the buck stops with me as the commander in chief
4865837 in a web video emailed to supporters obama asks his supporters to help him declare our independence from a broken system of course its not so much a broken system that explains why hes passing on the fecs 80 million he will easily raise more than he could ever get in public funding
4865838 if you are nominated for president in 2008 and your major opponents agree to forgo private funding in the general election campaign will you participate in the presidential public financing system
4865839 yes i have been a long time advocate for public financing of campaigns combined with free television and radio time as a way to reduce the influence of moneyed special interests
4865840 a simple question will you as president say to canada and mexico this nafta has not worked for us we are out
4865841 i will make sure that we renegotiate in the same way that senator clinton talked about and i think actually senator clintons answer on this one is right i think we should use the hammer of a potential opt out as leverage to ensure that we actually get labor and environmental standards that are enforced
4865842 in an interview with fortune to be featured in the magazines upcoming issue the presumptive democratic nominee backed off his harshest attacks on the free trade agreement and indicated he didnt want to unilaterally reopen negotiations on nafta sometimes during campaigns the rhetoric gets overheated and amplified he conceded after i reminded him that he had called nafta devastating and a big mistake despite nonpartisan studies concluding that the trade zone has had a mild positive effect on the u s economy
4865843 sen obamas nod to lowering corporate taxes comes as republicans have been attacking him for proposals that would raise the cost of doing business such as his pledge to raise the tax rate on capital gains and his vow to increase the top income tax rates which are often used by small unincorporated enterprises he didnt say how deeply he would cut the rate but said it could be trimmed in return for reducing corporate tax breaks simplifying the tax system
4865844 and his proposals which are essentially 300 billion worth of corporate tax cuts i think is the exact wrong prescription for america
4865845 it looks to me that the d c handgun ban overshot the runway that it went beyond constitutional limits
4865846 t he campaign of democratic presidential hopeful barack obama said that he
4865847 one other issue thats of great importance here in the district as well is gun control you said in idaho recently im quoting here i have no intention of taking away folks guns but you support the d c handgun ban
4865848 barack obama aligned himself with welfare reform on monday launching a television ad which touts the way the overhaul slashed the rolls by 80 percent obama leaves out however that he was against the 1996 federal legislation which precipitated the caseload reduction
4865849 i am not a defender of the status quo with respect to welfare obama said on the floor of the illinois state senate on may 31 1997
4865850 make no mistake this is an area where john mccain is offering a third bush term
4865851 obama knocks mccain says primary fight not hurting philadelphia inquirer 4 1 08
4865852 obama of course voted for the 2005 energy bill which passed the senate overwhelmingly 74 26
4865853 someone else who voted against it the candidate whom obama says is offering a third bush term on energy policy john mccain
4865854 i dont think that we can take nuclear power off the table
4865855 i dont think that we can take nuclear power off the table what we have to make sure of is that we have the capacity to store it properly and safely and that we reduce whatever threats might come from terrorism
4865856 i start off with the premise that nuclear energy is not optimal i am not a nuclear energy proponent
4865857 asked if obama would be seen as reversing himself if he were to endorse an individual mandate after clashing with clinton on the issue patel dismissed the concern he has not said he is opposed to it kavita patel told abc news he has voiced his disagreement with having that be a part of his health care plan last year but he is not opposed to the idea itself patel added that the obama campaign is in touch with former clinton health care advisers
4865858 weve got a philosophical difference which weve debated repeatedly and that is that senator clinton believes the only way to achieve universal health care is to force everybody to purchase it and my belief is the reason that people dont have it is not because they dont want it but because they cant afford it
4865859 to be clear barack will support a filibuster of any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies
4865860 obama camp says it hell support filibuster of any bill containing telecom immunity
4865861 under this compromise legislation an important tool in the fight against terrorism will continue it does however grant retroactive immunity and i will work in the senate to remove this provision so that we can seek full accountability for past offenses so i support the compromise but do so with a firm pledge that as president i will carefully monitor the program review the report by the inspectors general and work with the congress to take any additional steps i deem necessary to protect the lives and the liberty of the american people
4865862 senator whats your reaction to the supreme courts decision today striking down the death penalty for a child rapist
4865863 i disagree with the decision i have said repeatedly that i think that the death penalty should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes i think that the rape of a small child 6 or 8 years old is a heinous crime and if a state makes a decision that under narrow limited well defined circumstances the death penalty is at least potentially applicable that that does not violate our constitution now i think its you know had the supreme court said we want to constrain the ability of the states to do this to make sure that its done in a careful and appropriate way that would have been one thi ng but it basically had a blanket prohibition and i disagreed with that decision
4865864 w ould you be willing to meet separately without precondition during the first year of your administration in washington or anywhere else with the leaders of iran syria venezuela cuba and north korea in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries
4865865 i would and the reason is this that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration is ridiculous
4865866 on foreign policy obama went from stating that he would meet without preconditions with the president of iran to saying he would meet with the appropriate iranian leaders at a time and place of my choosing if and only if it can advance the interests of the united states
4865867 jerusalem will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
4865868 i want to ask you about something you said in aipac yesterday you said that jerusalem must remain undivided do palestinians have no claim to jerusalem in the future
4865869 well obviously its going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues
4865870 as president ill maintain the embargo its an important inducement for change because we know that castros death will not guarantee freedom
4865871 its got a good beat and you can dance to it
4865872 in january 2004 obama said it was time to end the embargo with cuba because it had utterly failed in the effort to overthrow castro
4865873 i think its time for us to end the embargo with cuba
4865874 democratic presidential candidate barack obama who previously said the issue of gay marriage should be left up to each state has announced his opposition to a california ballot measure that would ban same sex marriages
4865875 obama had previously said he opposes same sex marriage but that each state should make its own decision
4865876 i have repeatedly said that i think its entirely appropriate for states to restrict or even prohibit late term abortions as long as there is a strict well defined exception for the health of the mother now i dont think that mental distress qualifies as the health of the mother i think it has to be a serious physical issue that arises in pregnancy where there are real significant problems to the mother carrying that child to term
4865877 in a recent interview obama appears to back away from his long stated positions on abortion and a proposed federal abortion rights law he had co sponsored repudiate 35 years of accepted supreme court rulings on the issue and embrace a view on abortion restrictions that has been expressed on the court only by justices thomas and scalia
4865878 i am happy to have a debate with john mccain and george bush about foreign policy if john mccain wants to meet me anywhere anytime to have a debate about our respective policies in iraq iran the middle east or around the world that is a conversation i am happy to have because i believe that there is no separation between john mccain and george bush when it comes to our middle east policy and i think their policy has failed
4865879 avoiding town hall meetings and rejecting public campaign financing may be predictable strategies for minimizing one of mccains greatest strengths and exploiting one of his key weaknesses but they pull obama down into the cynical political calculations he pledged to rise above
4865880 sen obama has looked at this issue he recognizes that americans are suffering that we have a unique situation with rising gas prices and this is one occasion where we need to look at this strategically and he made the decision that we need to tap the strategic petroleum reserves
4865881 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
4865882 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
4865883 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
4865884 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
4865885 if weve got a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like then obviously thats something that i would consider because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
4865886 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
4865887 thats how we can protect our coastline and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good
4865888 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis

4865912 but i do want to know how they handle a crisis because a lot of the things in the presidency often deal with things you dont know are going to happen that we dont know will happen in the next four years there are a lot of different things you can deal with in the life of a leader that will tell us more about the candidate than some of the typical questions
4865913 i can tell you this theyre not a monolithic bloc as the press frequently tries to make them out to be i think that for many evangelicals theyre not convinced that either of these men is an evangelical they may be believers in christ they may be christian but they want to know for instance their worldview and they want to hear it out

4865964 scotts health deteriorated quite markedly and you can see that from his journal it starts off as a very intelligent very well written and interesting piece of work but as it gets towards the end of his life it begins to fall apart
4865965 there was no doubt that his mind weakened and his writing suffered as a result of this
4865966 with his decaying powers and this compulsion to keep writing he produced these two final work there is absolutely no doubt that they are way below the standards of his best work
4865967 it is the ghost of genius wandering once its soul has left you can almost imagine what scott might have done had he been at the height of his powers
4865968 for all that scott repeats himself uses the wrong word and sometimes loses control of the shape of his sentences there is no mistaking the onward drive of his story
4865969 omission of a word substitution of another word reshaping the grammar of a sentence will usually resolve the problems
4865970 nearly 200 years after they were first written todays readers finally have the chance to read scotts very last pieces of fiction in whatever form they are encountered these are unique and moving texts by a master of resonant storytelling
4865971 had not lost his power to tell a good story
4865972 i think the publication of these two final books will provide a fascinating insight it will be great for scholars i am very much of the view that great authors should be published warts and all
4865973 scott is held in high regard all over the world and this will spark international interest we will definitely be getting hold of some copies of the new book and im sure they will be very popular with visitors
4865974 we were all ready to go donald wilson murray international holdings chief executive had negotiated it for months with complete confidentiality
4865975 everything was pretty much agreed and then i said look gentlemen before we do this can you tell me how youre going to run this club
4865976 im sitting there with all the legal documents in front of me and they outline their plans well carve this up well sell that off and after a while i said enough were not doing the deal we got up and walked out we took our papers and went out of the door it wasnt for rangers in my opinion they did not want to take the club forward in a football way
4865977 thats the closest ive come to selling a few hours last year in a nice london hotel
4865978 they must look at the financial underpinning the murray group has done at rangers lets be under no illusions its cost us 100m ill tell you this unless youre backed by proper cash this club will have to downsize there is an economic crisis out there
4865979 if any party is greedy we have agreed that mr mugabe will be president whilst i become prime minister
4865980 we envisage that the prime minister must chair the cabinet and be responsible for the formulation execution and administration of government business including appointing and dismissing his ministers a prime minister cannot be given responsibility without authority and be expected to deliver
4865981 shall be commander in chief of the defence forces of zimbabwe
4865982 the outside world continues to watch developments in zimbabwe closely and with concern not least given the deteriorating humanitarian situation
4865983 to help put zimbabwe on the right road to its recovery
4865984 we have run very successful female classes for a while now
4865985 but girls in the class kept coming up to me and saying that their boyfriend or brother or cousin wanted to take part
4865986 we decided to try out some mens classes and the response has been great
4865987 increasingly it is guys in their late 20s and early 30s who are looking to keep their bodies toned some people see it as a novelty and a bit of fun but most of them take it very seriously
4865988 in reality it is great way to work out we are based in a purpose built dance studio not a seedy nightclub
4865989 we have been in fruitful discussion with the health and education authorities and we are satisfied that the programme to be rolled out across the country now is a responsible and ethically appropriate one
4865990 we wanted to make sure any support materials were appropriate in the catholic schools and we didnt want hpv and cervical cancer to be linked with artificial contraception the factual information about the vaccine and cervical cancer are still there but it doesnt promote particular kinds of sexual behaviour we had discussions about it we looked at various forms of words and came to an agreement it took some months
4865991 the hpv vaccination will only protect young women from two strains of hpv leading to cervical cancer it is critically important that young people understand the need to use condoms to protect them from other stis
4865992 this message should be highlighted and underlined please remember this injection doesnt protect you from sexually transmitted diseases or becoming pregnant
4865993 the moral position is being imposed upon them it seems a bit archaic to let the catholic church decide on this
4865994 the hpv vaccine is about saving lives and protecting future generations of young girls from cervical cancer
4865995 scottish government officials consulted with many stakeholders and undertook research with parents and girls to ensure the right level of information was included in the leaflet the scottish government is absolutely committed to promoting safer sex and we are taking forward our sexual health strategy respect and responsibility
4865996 would you mind moving a little bit to the left
4865997 one of the first pupils to benefit from comprehensive education in ayrshire
4865998 but the point about it was that it actually reinforced that i was good at this there was excitement and a level of achievement
4865999 as time went on i found myself becoming more and more interested in social issues
4866000 i enjoy as much as anybody looking in art galleries at different things because it gives you a different perspective on life but i think we can do more with it than that
4866001 community art and how we use art as part of a regeneration process for communities
4866002 i come from a pretty straightforward working class community and i have shared the kind of experiences that people in those communities have why would that make me any less able to be a politician
4866003 actually i think it is an advantage because it does allow me to understand where people have come from and what their hopes and aspirations are
4866004 it doesnt sit at odds with a principled position if you take the view that communities shouldnt be abandoned to people involved in anti social behaviour that people should be able to see people on the streets and prisoners need to have staff in there working with them
4866005 i would hope that gordon and people around him will recognise that this is the first time every member of the labour party and all the affiliates have their chance to put their name on the ballot paper
4866006 on the one hand they are saying this is great but on the other they are saying where has the summer gone
4866007 i came into this knowing it was going to be tough i was very clear about what i was letting myself in for but this time around i felt the party needed a contest and i was determined to play my part in that
4866008 gordon could come through the party conference have a successful relaunch and get back on track only to throw it all away by losing a by election in november
4866009 we should do it now before the mps are back at westminster if we lost in november with mps all back no one knows what would happen
4866010 he should do it as quickly as possible it is clear that the longer you leave it the more momentum the snp will get
4866011 everyone who was at the velodrome was cheering him on and were extremely happy for him the win didnt come as a surprise though we expected him to do it as he has worked so hard
4866012 i cant actually believe it at the minute its so nice for the work to have paid off ive worked so hard for it
4866013 if the queen is listening to this two golds dame rebecca adlington dame rebecca adlington
4866014 we knew she had it in her she started strong and she kept it going all the way through everybody in the room was on their feet screaming and crying theres no word for the emotion it was absolute jubilation her face when she looked up at the board and realised what she had done was just fantastic
4866015 we will be showing the two races on big screens there will be a fireworks finale and then it will be back to the civic centre for a big party she has raised the profile of mansfield and as an individual she is remarkable she provides inspiration for other youngsters in the town
4866016 it is a proud proud day for us all we have seen the blood sweat and tears they have put in
4866017 i cannot believe this now it means absolutely everything to me
4866018 i had better get a good nights sleep to make sure i come back tomorrow with some fire in the belly
4866019 braveheart final this is a fantastic achievement and scotlands greatest sporting moment at the olympics of all time they did scotland proud
4866020 one of the least reported and most scandalous features of the khartoum regimes domestic policies
4866021 national wealth and power to further enrich itself and its cronies while the marginalised regions of the country suffer from terrible poverty
4866022 it does have the potential to be the breadbasket of africa
4866023 smallholder food production goes down commercial food production goes up and food relief serves as a subsidy to this transformation keeping the displaced alive
4866024 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here but if something were to happen id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is okay because we were able to protect them
4866025 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started
4866026 why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves
4866027 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorisation of the institution
4866028 one accident and i dont know how the school board would live with themselves individual school boards should not the type of power to be able to do this
4866029 this is a disaster waiting to happen it is right up there with the worst ideas in the history of modern education
4866030 we could end up arming half the gangs in houston
4866031 this is the type of decision that makes texas a laughing stock both nationally and internationally
4866032 it is foolish to introduce more weapons into the school environment
4866033 in the event of a crisis there is no manageable way to integrate armed staff into the crisis response plan
4866034 gun control extremists may despise it but this is a common sense approach to the potential of school violence
4866035 thankfully in this country we see guns as a dangerous problem and not as a solution
4866036 reporting my rape was one of the hardest things ive ever done i was intimidated and embarrassed by the system by police officers asking personal questions like my bra size and asking if i drank a lot
4866037 i had to have photos taken of my naked body and the injuries and at times i felt like i wished i had never started it
4866038 at times i felt like it was my fault but i was determined to fight for some kind of justice and i think a lot of women give up before that
4866039 i would like to be included in the expert group on sexual crime or even if they would take a written submission from me
4866040 i volunteered to be an expert on rape once before when they were looking into bringing specialist experts into court rooms i was told i couldnt but i think i am pretty expert on it
4866041 i knew nothing about rape when it happened and thats the thing most people dont i would like to help women know more so if it happens they have more options
4866042 i think its absolutely vital to have the centres i couldnt have done this without them i couldnt have even managed to file the report with the police
4866043 all the doctors and nurses have experience of working with rape victims so they know how you might react your injuries and they make you feel very normal and safe
4866044 if i took the money it would have been tainted
4866045 i thought 25p in each pound will say you did this to yourself whatever i bought with it a quarter of it would make me feel terrible
4866046 in my mind they were telling me i was partly responsible for being raped
4866047 i knew getting a review from the criminal injuries compensation authority would take another two years and it had already been dragging on for four years since it happened and i didnt know if i was strong enough
4866048 but i was so angry i just wanted someone to listen and im glad i did because weve revealed something the cica was doing that was really immoral
4866049 people think women have one default setting which is to drink themselves into oblivion
4866050 you can have a couple of glasses of wine and be fine as i was but the first thing anyone would say is youve been drinking as if you have somehow brought it on yourself i think its really unfair
4866051 people think women are a lot more liberated than they are
4866052 i dearly wanted to see you and my sons i never gave up hopes that if i lived long one day i would be able to see you again
4866053 but he quickly recovered his language skill we had private time just between the two of us
4866054 my husband said he was sorry for leaving everything to me and thanked me for raising the two children
4866055 he said it was his great honour in his life to meet me
4866056 in terms of preventing the spread of infection the most important and effective method is hand washing whatever the organism people should be washing their hands after touching each patient the problem is that some hospitals do not have adequate facilities for handwashing which is one of the issues highlighted in the report into vale of leven
4866057 staff have been told that they could use alcohol gel instead of washing their hands
4866058 that is not a good message to give people they should be told they should wash their hands but a lot of wards have dispensers when they should have more hand basins
4866059 what would make sense would be for hospitals to remove the dispensers and replace them with adequate hand washing facilities in wards and clinical areas
4866060 by and large no i suspect its because staff have been told that they can use alcohol gel rather than washing their hands and they have come to the conclusion that they are being told that because it is effective
4866061 very effective at disinfecting hands and killing a whole host of bugs and germs
4866062 hand gel provides healthcare workers with a quick method of decontaminating their hands between healthcare interventions and facilitates higher levels of compliance with hand hygiene
4866063 it is important that staff patients and visitors not only wash their hands with soap and water but combine this practice with the use of alcohol based hand gels
4866064 no proper assessment has been done on the impact of the cut off proposals on agricultural production
4866065 the scc would obviously be concerned at anything that would cause food prices to continue to rise given the pressure that this is already bringing to bear on families across scotland particularly those on lower incomes
4866066 these products underwent extensive testing before they were allowed to be used initially there is no evidence they are injurious to human health
4866067 many are pesticides vital to the continued production of food crops in scotland the uk and most of northern europe the risk for food supply food security and food pricing is that if we lose these products then there is nothing there to replace them in the short term
4866068 the ability of scottish farmers to produce these crops will be severely undermined
4866069 when we lost a similar tonnage recently in the maize market in the us prices went up by 60 we can assume that there would be a similar price increase if eu cereal yields fall by 20
4866070 if these substances were banned and yields dropped we have to find somewhere to import the deficit from thats okay in a good year but in a bad year there is nowhere to go if you reduce grain supply the price will go up
4866071 the commission proposal would affect only a few substances which are the most problematic ones for human health and the environment
4866072 farmers use different products every year to ensure that resistance doesnt build up reducing our armoury could be catastrophic and we are working hard to make sure that european politicians understand the severity of what is being proposed
4866073 people may be good at sport but may not have chosen the sport they have the potential to be best in
4866074 there is a lot of chance involved when people take up sport and most stick to what they stumbled across in school and may not have had the opportunity since to try out different things
4866075 some may never have tried rowing or sailing but find that they are absolutely right for them the testing programme will give us the opportunity to find out what people are capable of we hope to find some of our olympic medallists of the future
4866076 we got an e mail at university about girls4gold and it seemed too good an opportunity to miss
4866077 i just want to see whether i have the potential to become an olympian and it is not often you get the chance to mix with olympic athletes and coaches
4866078 i have always had a sport on the go and endurance is probably one of my strongest points i like the idea of cycling and as i have already done swimming that could be good for the modern pentathlon fencing swimming running pistol shooting and show jumping you never know i might have hidden talents
4866079 i was quite surprised to be picked but it would be amazing if i could go on from there because i would love to be an athlete
4866080 i just might not have found the sport im best at as yet
4866081 girls4gold is a fantastic opportunity many people dream of representing their country or taking part in the olympics
4866082 this is the best opportunity some will get to make it come true
4866083 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps
4866084 its rare for a whole team of sierra leoneans to go abroad and come back
4866085 it goes to show what sierra leone can do when it puts its mind to it we have managed to stick a feather in the cap for the country
4866086 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
4866087 until now our ability to represent the high latitude oceans and sea ice in oceanographic and climate models has suffered as a result
4866088 it picked him up so to speak and the car was left back at the crossing
4866089 i guess you could say he had an angel looking out for him
4866090 in a meeting about the credit paper of standard grade maths examiners agreed there was a degree of difficulty that was necessary and intended
4866091 they assured themselves all the elements were in the curriculum but there was a recognition that the paper had been perceived to be difficult so the grade boundaries were adjusted accordingly
4866092 it would be unfair on pupils to be disadvantaged by sitting an exam in a year when the paper was particularly difficult
4866093 while setting the same level of difficulty in exams can never be exact from year to year the processes that are in place help to ensure that the system is as fair and consistent as possible
4866094 its absolutely critical to retain numeracy standards particularly around the lothians there is a very strong base of financial sector companies not even just companies but headquarters of companies
4866095 the area where there is a real worry which impinges on standard grade is the number of primary teachers who are not confident in numeracy because they dont need higher maths to go into primary teaching
4866096 we are very lucky to be positioned in an ideal area our main customers are the west enders young affluent professionals
4866097 they recognise the higher quality of items that we are looking for and are also willing to pay that little bit more for things they want to buy
4866098 sometimes people come in with shabby binbags but when you open them up they are full of designer clothes
4866099 we know our market and just wont bother putting out clothes that we know wont sell because of that we dont bother with primark or asda george clothes as they are not what our customers are looking for
4866100 the money raised by the shops is crucial in helping us fund projects in over 70 countries around the world
4866101 we are now in peace time why should we be blowing up bridges when our job is to restore
4866102 gerhartsreiter is at the centre of the longest con ive ever seen in my professional career
4866103 as prosecutors we need more than a photo and a fading memory to walk into court and amend a complaint
4866104 by looking at the way in which roads pipelines rivers and other man made markers are affected we can map out how the earth moved what faults were responsible and what kind of activity we might expect in future events
4866105 there are 43 indictees out of 45 that are already sent to the hague
4866106 make sure that general mladic and hadzic are found and given a chance to defend themselves
4866107 i hope and i will suggest that sooner rather than later we are going to be able to announce that this chapter is closed and that there are no more indictees
4866108 we are a friend of all people in the world even israelis and americans
4866109 we do not recognise a country called israel and so we cannot recognise a nation called israel
4866110 if mr mashai does not have the political awareness that the israeli people are the same people who have occupied the homes of millions of innocent and oppressed palestinians and have created the army of the zionist regime he has no right to hold such a position
4866111 the university of oxford has no record of ali kordan receiving an honorary doctorate or any other degree from the university
4866112 if he fails to decide to quit within the next two days the impeachment process will take its course
4866113 president musharraf is confident about defending himself in the parliament and defeating the charge sheet easily because whatever he did he did in the interest of the country and for the nation
4866114 this should be clear to everyone as impeachment is a constitutional affair and that could only be done through the parliament
4866115 fco the foreign office contacted me about that mathers proposed meeting and i re supplied the lines about this being a matter for uk ministers
4866116 the article said that jim mather would meet norwegian ministers to discuss in october so i suggested that our post in norway should make sure that their opposite numbers were clear about uk responsibilities
4866117 the generation transmission distribution and supply of electricity are reserved matters under the scotland act 1998 as are international relations it is for the uk government to take any decisions and deal with other countries in relation to those matters
4866118 berr is proving to be the single biggest obstacle to scotland fulfilling our renewable energy potential not only have they refused to act to counter unfair connection charges imposed on generators in scotland over a period of years now they are actively undermining the building of transmission systems
4866119 this memo consolidates berrs reputation as the worst department in the uk government a failure as far as scotland is concerned the uk government rakes in oil billions but gives nothing in return it is the department that likes to say no to scotland
4866120 the term cancer covers a wide range of conditions with variable presentations variable rates of biological progression and varying complexities of diagnosis and treatment
4866121 for patients with squamous carcinoma of lung and a potential doubling time of less than two weeks a 62 day target is clearly inappropriate
4866122 the initiative does not provide the most appropriate measure of cancer care and has serious flaws particularly in the damage it has done to clinical audit of treatment and outcome now is the time to refocus attention to quality of care and clinical audit rather than waiting times
4866123 its written by clinicians who are actively managing patients with cancer and these are our clinical concerns
4866124 tells us where patients are in the system and thats a reasonable thing to want to know
4866125 it is very difficult to say when this is going to stop
4866126 there is less material being emitted but the volcano could reactivate at any moment
4866127 its very exciting its like an indiana jones adventure its searching for a lost underwater tomb
4866128 our objective is to find and protect the wreck because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have
4866129 we did have an incident which took place with a small number of people but the majority of people who have come here today behaved impeccably
4866130 we have thrown our weight behind this because we think theres a difference between free speech and free expression and attacking someone for the colour of their skin or their sexual orientation
4866131 the bnp stands for everything that we are not we are here as a trade union to promote unity for the betterment of working men and working women and the bnp stand for attacking those who have different colour skin from their own
4866132 i support the anti fascists the bnp should never have been allowed here in the first place
4866133 see im the opposite solo most of my thoughts are not in words or at least not primarily in words any time i talk its a translation
4866134 when we arrived the news came that gori was being shelled
4866135 i dont know why it is being presented that russia invaded georgia this is all disinformation and lies its an information war
4866136 justifying what the kgb people are doing in my country
4866137 when it comes to apportioning blame for the latest flareup in the caucasus theres plenty to go around the russians were clearly itching for a fight but the behaviour of georgian president mikhail saakashvili has been erratic and provocative the united states may have stoked the conflict by encouraging saakashvili to believe that he enjoyed american protection when the wests ability to impose its will in this part of the world is actually quite limited it is difficult to explain why kosovo should have the right to unilaterally declare its independence from serbia while the same right should be denied to places such as south ossetia and abkhazia
4866138 given how overt the kremlins aims are the fiery nationalist president of georgia mikheil saakashvili blundered grievously when he responded to small scale violence from local separatists in south ossetia by sending georgian troops to shell and assault the breakaway regions capital city
4866139 even the most ardent adversaries of moscow have no choice but to accept it was georgian military forces that attacked the separatist pro russian province of south ossetia bombarding its capital and killing russian peacekeepers who had been there for 15 years following the un decision to maintain peace from the moment bush became president he has wanted russia to be isolated both economically and geographically he must think there is no difference between yesterdays soviet union and todays russia for a moment putin believed in bushs friendship and tried to provide some gauge of good will wasnt it him who removed russian military bases from cuba and vietnam has he not joined the osce and thats despite the disillusion and anger when the us installed military bases in central asia georgia the czech republic and poland
4866140 is a national grassroots campaign organizing millions of americans to win a guarantee of quality affordable health care for all
4866141 were offering a bold new solution that gives you real choice and a guarantee of quality coverage you can afford keep your current private insurance plan pick a new private insurance plan or join a public health insurance plan were also calling for regulation on health insurance companies we need to set and enforce rules that quash health insurance companies greed once and for all
4866142 insurers do not turn people away raise rates or drop coverage based on a persons health history or wrongly delay or deny care
4866143 an affliction so intolerable its known as the suicide disease
4866144 do you ever feel like breaking down do you ever feel out of place like somehow you just dont belong and no one understands you do you ever wanna runaway do you lock yourself in your room with the radio on turned up so loud that no one hears you screaming are you stuck inside a world you hate are you sick of everyone around with their big fake smiles and stupid lies while deep inside youre bleeding
4866145 hypertension and diatribes is so high in the african american community it gives them a chance to get a screening and possible hooked up with some services blood pressure needs to be tested more frequently
4866146 face down is their most famous song the song is about how the band looks down to men that hurt their girlfriends or wife physically how they really respect women

4866149 we had to restrain the firemen from running around town with the fire trucks ringing the sirens everybodys just overjoyed nobody deserved it more than she its great
4866150 i thought from the very first bouts that they had she just came on confidant and did what she had to do
4866151 carol is the winner and so then is the whole family and so are we as a community
4866152 youre going through town and youre seeing probably 30 40 people wearing these shirts that has her name and beijing 2008 theyre red with the canada flag
4866153 canada is delighted to see them standing tall on the podium with the worlds best athletes
4866154 we are extremely proud of canadas olympic team competing in beijing

4866167 its very satisfying and encouraging even if its not a surprise
4866168 this win will do us good its precious before two away games weve been quick to win at home which is important in our relation with our fans
4866169 taking these steps will make us a more efficient agile and cost effective organization in almost every aspect of our business from product development to production to aftermarket support
4866170 first we go to our local wholesaler and see what seasonal and hopefully organic product they have in stock that week then we bring the flowers to our studio where we condition them providing enough water and love to ensure that they open nicely and in a healthy growth oriented environment after that we make a trip to our studios garden yes its in our backyard its ok to be a little jealous and start clipping the gorgeous foliages and seasonal accents we plan to combine with the wholesale flowers we finish the process with the design we have 5 designers all with a different eye and artistic style so each arrangement is very special and always unique
4866171 i wont be appearing in qts forthcoming inglorious bastards due to insurmountable scheduling difficulties we really tried to make it work but in the end it just was not possible without severe ramifications elsewhere
4866172 he worked well on friday so he will go to york we have no real concerns should the ground ride soft
4866173 it was just a pity i couldnt celebrate with a win
4866174 murali kartik bowls more dot balls and more four balls shaun udal goes for more ones and twos but fewer fours together they go for six an over which is pretty good

4866179 hendo can go in anywhere in the order its never an exact science
4866180 we were well in control and probably what we did with the ball at the start of that second half gave them a bit of a sniff
4866181 we showed a bit of desire commitment enthusiasm call it what you want but you can credit it all under the one word attitude
4866182 we are travelling with about 800 costumes and 10 15 tonnes of luggage that include props equipment and baggage
4866183 there are 40 dancers all from shiamak davars troupe and nearly 60 people managing travel costumes wardrobes stage and other paraphernalia
4866184 i have designed the sets and we are using the same sets everywhere it normally takes three days to set up the entire stage the team has to reach the venue well in dvance to make all the arrangements for the performance stars usually arrive on the day of the performance
4866185 he is absolutely fit and goes to the gym every day as far as food is concerned we are coordinating with restaurants and hotels and getting good food anyway all the stars are very particular about their diet so that is not a problem
4866186 we have a discussion with the local promoters and decide to host shows in the area where there is a huge asian population

4866194 they are two nice horses and we are very hopeful
4866195 we know how tough a race the st leger is for a three year old and lord weinstock always maintained that winning it with sun princess cost us the arc which is the one jewel that we dont yet have in our crown
4866196 people dont realise how gruelling the leger is both physically and mentally and it was the same with air marshall who never recovered from his battle against millenary
4866197 however while it was fashionable to knock the st leger at one time its popularity is returning and with a wealth of prize money around for the staying horses the race is back in favour with the owner breeders as befits a classic with so much history
4866198 the two big battalions coolmore and godolphin have won six of the last 10 runnings but we will never stop trying at ballymacoll racing would be no fun if we all sat back and watched them clean up and though no decision has yet been made about conduit if patkai comes through this dress rehearsal it will be all systems go for doncaster
4866199 remember he is by indian ridge and he would not want to be going that trip every day of the week he is not short of speed and has a great temperament with an in your face aggressive attitude and of course he is with a trainer who is a master at improving horses
4866200 conduit would be more the cup horse for next year and if he does run at doncaster he will go straight there while our derby runner up tartan bearer is on the comeback trail having had two hard races at epsom and the curragh he might yet return for the champion stakes at newmarket in october
4866201 american simply didnt enforce the system and therefore the system is broken
4866202 the picture it paints is on paper they have a pretty good program but in reality they really dont follow it
4866203 and if you have x number of mechanical procedures performed on an airplane and one of them was performed by a mechanic who was impaired thats too many you cant do it its just that simple

4866209 lydia i know its hard but at least you had him today hes still hanging in for us and you know when its his time you have to think about it like this he is going to feel like he was when he was a puppy he will have control over everything again and one day you will get to see him again and you will get to play with him like when he was young just be thankful you had him today and enjoy everyday you have with him
4866210 i encourage each and every one of you to take the experiences from this past week and weave them into your daily life back at home remember the faces the places and the memories lock inside of you the way you felt the smiles you saw and the beauty reflected all over by the lord throughout this trip
4866211 we believe that the club and the store will make a difference among educators here
4866212 we will continue to build similar resource centres so that teachers can become better at what they do he said
4866213 e learning and tools like the interactive whiteboard are part of the future he said
4866214 teachers will also be able to come here sit down at the terminals and try out our instructional software she said adding that the next phase would be to put the store online
4866215 we already have a relationship with many teachers in the 1 600 schools in malaysia that use scholastic materials the setting up of the club is a logical extension
4866216 there has been a big focus on technology in the classroom over the past five years the interactive whiteboard is beneficial as it makes for fun and interesting lessons for children said cripps

4866221 the things that pop music was there to do for us have all been done theres nothing to rail against now
4866222 when i was 15 in the north west of england the record cover to me was like a picture window to another world seeing an andy warhol illustration on a velvet underground album was a revelation it was the art of your generation true pop art
4866223 with downloads and everything its just killing the whole art side of music stone dead to be quite honest unless you have 20 20 vision its very hard to read anything written on a cd cover there was something very special about vinyl albums its a great shame
4866224 iconic sleeves can help to sell significant amounts of records
4866225 if a band has put effort into the music why not devote that same meticulousness to the package
4866226 you are creating a sleeve that you want to be as iconic as possible its got to work when its a thumbnail on amazon its got to work on the shelves at tesco and on the racks at hmv
4866227 with bands being able to sell music online it frees designers from the constraints of retailers
4866228 but now what is fantastic is that we see bands selling music online where they can sell either a digital download or offer the option to buy a special packaging version of the product that can be mailed to them that can be any shape any size and any format

4866504 you could turn the cells for example into liver cells and have them ready for when the baby is born
4866505 any abnormality that would not be lethal before a baby is born
4866506 how could you think that such a book would interest me i am too near eternity to be distracted with trifles

4866513 i am suppose to be in a strong 3g coverage area at home but i only have 1 bar
4866514 traveling around town sacramento area my 3g coverage changes dramatically from 1 bar to full bars not sure if its working properly or not
4866515 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
4866516 lots of things make them work or not work even peoples sweaty hands could have an effect or how close they hold the device to their heads or what direction they are pointing the phone
4866517 id be surprised if it is as simple as a firmware upgrade of the chip so it is more likely that existing devices will have this defect forever

4866525 i was pushing the envelope a little bit because he was playing well he was kind of our igniter and you kind of hate to take a guy out like that i kick myself for it a little bit
4866526 weve been close before i dont know if we would have been able to get by tony or not he was pretty quick
4866527 the car was awesome all day there were a couple of cars that were real fast tony and brian vickers but my pit crew just did a great job there at the end i dont know what kind of problem tony had on pit road but it was sure a lot easier to pass him there than it would have been on the racetrack
4866528 weve certainly had more than our share of good finishes here and it seems like its a track where we always race well
4866529 you dont want to come across greedy but im getting sick and tired of not winning one of these races
4866530 we feel like every race weve been in weve led but we havent led the right lap
4866531 i really feel like it was the power difference between the ford and the toyotas with the new restrictor plate carl just got too far out ahead of us at the end and we didnt have enough time
4866532 i never thought it would be such a big deal but it has been its not like ill never these guys again but i know this is the last time im going to work with this particular group of guys
4866533 stewart haas racing has had and will continue to have discussions with numerous people regarding leadership positions within the team including crew chiefs for the nos 4 and 14 teams at this point no decisions have been made in regard to filling those positions
4866534 were working to not get just one crew chief were working to get a pair of crew chiefs that are going to work well together
4866535 it helps us work together better as drivers and keeps the organization just that much more intact
4866536 ive seen multicar organizations that the crew chiefs were in different directions with each other and they dont utilize the opportunity of what a two car team is all about in the right way
4866537 weve been in a lot of meetings in the last four weeks with a lot of different people from different organizations that have come to us wanting to be a part of this
4866538 joe has been a huge part of that you know its just talking to the right people
4866539 that just gives us that many more options and people to choose from
4866540 we are getting people hired we have commitments from people that were currently working on contracts right now that are some key people that we think are really going to be able to help us build this program
4866541 the baseball gods have been with us a little bit

4866549 our tests also found that the transmitter in the prototype device is capable of causing interference to tv broadcasting and wireless microphones
4866550 initial evaluation of the performance of prototype tv band white space devices
4866551 direct pickup interference tests of three consumer digital cable television receivers available in 2005
4866552 based on the report allowing these devices in the television band will result in massive amounts of interference harming consumers that have purchased new dtv sets and jeopardizing the government subsidized digital to analog converter box program
4866553 these levels of interference will derail the digital transition it confirms everything that mstv and the television industry have said for the past three years i think that they have significant problems here and that this is a diversion from the digital transition its time to stop this and move forward with the transition itself and get that done
4866554 coalition members are encouraged that fcc engineers did not find fault with our operating parameters and remain confident that unlicensed television spectrum can be used without interference
4866555 co channel interference is being manufactured in the tuner as the white space devices will probably use tv tuners to look for spaces in which to operate why wouldnt this happen to them also
4866556 tuners manufactured today have poor selectivity and are easily overloaded where are they going to get tuners that are bullet proof
4866557 the receiving part of these white space devices cant cost more than about 15
4866558 this forces manufacturers to build to a price not to a spec the people who build tuners dont seem to worry about this the fcc knows that this is an important element but what theyll do i dont know
4866559 it is a nuisance but i dont really see that there is a lot we can do about it
4866560 we like it when investors are long in a bull market and complain when theyre short in a bear market youve got to be a bit more pragmatic
4866561 they should put their money where their mouths are and take the opportunity to buy up stock some execs are doing that but a surprising number are not that doesnt exhibit much confidence in their own companies
4866562 the reason i was able to do that is that people have been shorting the stock
4866563 executives traipsing around the city are not enhancing the company from an operational point of view if you think the price is too low go and buy some shares
4866564 good luck to them but if they hang on long enough they are going to make big losses
4866565 who is doing all the lending it really isnt clear at all
4866566 many institutions have seen how counterproductive the practice is and cut it out it is a bit like running a race with one arm tied behind your back
4866567 o candidato tem de ter olhos atentos aos procedimentos que executa diariamente tentando apreender o m ximo de detalhes dos passos para concluir uma a o qualquer
4866568 he has a very very strong reputation but he has made some serious errors
4866569 he is by some way the most impressive chairman i have come across in 20 long years in this business
4866570 adrian montague and his board are in a position of significant weakness they have destroyed massive shareholder value over the past year with a flimsy recovery strategy
4866571 it was a serious misjudgment if an offer had been on the table and 150p was the best they would do shareholders would probably have taken it
4866572 the entire route of the btc the only major oil pipeline from the caspian region outside of russias control should now be treated as high risk and turkeys viability as an energy bridge to europe has been thrown into question
4866573 russia has a very clear strategy and would prefer europes gas to go via russia and not via independent countries there is no definite attempt by russia to disrupt supplies but it is not unhelpful to russia that there is unrest
4866574 could render further foreign investment in any oil and gas transport links that bypass russia too risky
4866575 we are a must keep service the fund managers risk officers and heads of compliance need our products to keep track of their valuation and performance
4866576 our renewal rate is 95 per cent so that means somebody cancels on average once every 20 years
4866577 our account managers should have very intensive relationships with clients they are expected to farm the accounts and sell additional professional services which are relevant to the clients
4866578 clearly the valuation when we floated was a little heroic but it is very poor now as we are in the grip of a bear market
4866579 i wont be investing in russia for a while global markets are risky enough at the moment without having to contend with the bizarre volatility of the russian state
4866580 no one here gives a sheet what your country thinks
4866581 there is nothing colourful about him as a person the colour comes from what he puts into the business he spends every day working in the business he works on the design floor and he is the first in and last out every day what has happened at inditex is a culmination of his lifes work
4866582 people either stay for a very short amount of time or a very long amount
4866583 it is like a religion there is a strong culture within and cultural fit is really important it is not a business that is driven by manuals or rules and regulations it is more a visual and aural business if you work at gap you get a manual to tell you how to go to the loo and how to lock the door inditex is not like that
4866584 the cloth is prepared and dyed by third parties in northern spain although inditex owns stakes in the dying companies the cloth then comes into zaras very big warehouse zara does the design and cuts the cloth into component parts for the garments and then the sewing is sent to be done by contractors
4866585 the gear then gets sent back to the warehouse for pressing labelling and packaging and then it is despatched direct to stores unlike other retailers there is no intermediate warehousing the quality is variable because of the production methods but the fashion tends to be a strong feature albeit more in tailored products than casual ones

4866587 i suppose if it had been two guys it may not have been given such a lot of coverage
4866588 i suppose it comes with the territory i have been asked to do three other shows which i have refused because they are more about me than the brand which i am not comfortable with
4866589 i was not a distributor knew nothing about it or about marketing but i did know the beauty industry and they gave me the opportunity to prove i could do it
4866590 loads of times the problem was funding i had sold my salon and my car i had no choice but to carry on and make it work
4866591 my mother was an inspiration holding a tough job in a mans world and bringing up a family

4866594 one word epic it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time hes the greatest racer who ever walked the planet
4866595 there is a lot of local heavy handedness which i think just reminds us that china is still an authoritarian state and we shouldnt forget it
4866596 its very important for us to build a very strong relationship but we have to be aware of the fact that its not a democracy
4866597 a lot of pressure that has come on china over the last 12 months over the last six months in particular is because they have got the olympics
4866598 i kept them out today because being the last day of camp i didnt want anyone to fall on them we have two weeks to go and maybe im paranoid but i feel so bad for all of our athletes all over america right now that cant play because of an injury
4866599 i keep praying hard not only for the mountaineers but for young men all over this country to stay healthy its really frustrating to see people get hurt and im praying that it doesnt happen to us
4866600 a lot of good things out there today and i think our defense played outstanding
4866601 again two interference calls with one in the pass skeleton drill and the other one which was frustrating to see the bottom line is that we gave the number ones good work and the number twos got 30 plays and we got points when we were down to the two minute drill and we made the kick that was a big kick by
4866602 the doctors are going to check him late tonight and hell have treatment tomorrow because we dont want it to fester so he was the only one that didnt play much today
4866603 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4866604 they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
4866605 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system
4866606 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4866607 im not gonna teach your boyfriend how to dance with you the twelves remix

4866611 if companies are running out of top line growth they have to generate growth from elsewhere

4866613 can anyone trust private equity any more how many times have they put something on the table and then just walked away without following through if a private equity firm wants to do a deal now i would like to see a 10 per cent deposit in the bank before anybody starts talking
4866614 share for share mergers allow institutional investors to participate in the upside
4866615 some company boards are reaching the conclusion that its worthwhile to take strategic value now
4866616 for someone thinking about selling a business the question is this do i continue to operate or do i cash out at a premium value and let others assume the risk
4866617 there are still many cases where buyers and sellers cant agree on value shareholders and boards expectations of value regarding the companies they hold have generally not fallen as much as traded equity values have

4866626 the board of lonmin has always seen its responsibility to create value for shareholders if we receive an offer at a level which we believe reflects the full value of the business then we would not hesitate to enthusiastically recommend it

4866637 tesco has not traditionally been one of the companies in the food retail sector which has attracted concern for the extent of its leverage but the market is watching tescos debt more closely than for a long time
4866638 the fact that the company has made two sizeable acquisitions in short order and continues to run the heaviest capital investment programme in the sector has begun to raise a few eyebrows as shown by several credit rating agency downgrades in the aftermath of the tesco personal finance deal
4866639 our graduate intake for 2008 is lower than last years figure which was inflated by a large number of graduates from our acquisition of donaldsons dtz continues to recruit in the uk and remains committed to providing its market leading graduate training programme
4866640 none of the big banks will dare say they are not recruiting for 2009 but i suspect numbers will be heavily cut especially in mergers and acquisitions the sexy department most graduates want to join
4866641 but it is safe to say the days of the super size graduate starting salary are over

4866647 although there is bad inflation news around there isnt much the bank of england can do it is too late
4866648 but if they look ahead to late 2009 the impact of the oil increase on the indices will be replaced by the impact of the oil price coming down you will get a very low inflation figure in autumn 2009 it isnt inconceivable that it will go beneath 1 per cent
4866649 although the inflation figures were bad the next move in interest rates should be down at the moment the money numbers are very worrying there is undoubtedly a corporate liquidity squeeze
4866650 the sharp decline in growth rates corroborates the message from the banks credit conditions survey and elsewhere that a marked tightening in the supply of money and credit is under way as financial institutions deleverage
4866651 sponsorship budgets are the first thing to go in a downturn

4866716 a thorough and definitive investigation by the commission would have addressed all of sibel edmonds concerns and spoken to all of the whistleblowers it would have subpoenaed for the information it required and examined the plethora of information that other citizens and groups responsible provided and finally without compromising our national security it would have reported all of its findings with its redactions blacked out and submitted to the american people in essence the commission could have produced a final product where the resulting conclusions and recommendations could be trusted instead at the end of the day what we got were some statements that truly insulted the intelligence of the american people violated our loved ones memories and might end up hurting us one day soon one such statement is that 9 11 was a failure of imagination a failure of whose imagination what exactly does that mean when you have a cia director with his hair on fire a system blinking red 52 faa warnings an august 6th 2001 pdb entitled bin laden determined to strike in the united states leads on several 9 11 hijackers including alhazmi almihdhar and marwan al shehi warnings from many foreign governments a phoenix memo warning of islamic extremists taking flying lessons the arrest of would be terrorist zacarias moussauoui facts imparted to one agent agent frasca at the rfu at the fbi 9 11 was truly a failure alright
4866717 it is clear that zelikow should never have been permitted to be a member of the commission since it is the mandate of the commission to identify the source of failures we can now see that trail would lead directly to the staff director himself
4866718 i dont have ideas exactly on how 9 11 happened but i know it didnt go as according to what the commission put down on paper and one of the reasons why we still continued to fight with for the commission even as we knew it was a farce is we wanted their words their lies down on paper we wanted to make them go through at least this exercise and even if it came down to the annals of history that the truth will come out that was part of our purpose our purposes were layered well be a pain in the butt thats fine well get their lies down on paper well have more americans wake up to the fact that their government is not looking out for their best interests in fact they may be counter to our best interests but none of this would have come to this point if in fact the commission didnt exist at all
4866719 with regard to the 9 11 attacks it has been said that the intelligence agencies have to be right 100 of the time and the terrorists only have to get lucky once this explanation for the devastating attacks of september 11th simple on its face is wrong in its value because the 9 11 terrorists were not just lucky once they were lucky over and over again allow me to illustrate
4866720 is it luck that aberrant stock trades were not monitored is it luck when 15 visas are awarded based on incomplete forms is it luck when airline security screenings allow hijackers to board planes with box cutters and pepper spray is it luck when emergency faa and norad protocols are not followed is it luck when a national emergency is not reported to top government officials on a timely basis to me luck is something that happens once when you have this repeated pattern of broken protocols broken laws broken communication one cannot still call it luck if at some point we dont look to hold the individuals accountable for not doing their jobs properly then how can we ever expect for terrorists not to get lucky again
4866721 one particular aspect of the report that is quite troubling to me and my organization is the discussion relating to the evacuation orders of the north tower on pages 322 323 of the report and the corresponding endnote numbers 209 it is alleged that many of the firefighters in the north tower heard the message to evacuate but chose to remain in the building prior to its collapse to the contrary this issue of firefighter deaths is directly tied to the lack of radio communication capability this has been well documented in the post 9 11 mckinsey report the ny times and numerous other publications and firefighter comments yet this theory that firefighters chose to die has also been advanced by some public officials undoubtedly hoping to deflect criticism for the inadequacy of the fdny radios and for the absence of a functioning incident command structure in nyc on 9 11 which undoubtedly could have saved so many firefighters lives including my own beautiful son christian
4866722 it is a national scandal the warren commission blew it im not going to be part of that im not going to be part of looking at information only partially im not going to be part of just coming to quick conclusions im not going to be part of political pressure to do this or not do that
4866723 for almost three years now norad officials and faa officials have been able to hide their critical failures that left this country defenseless during two of the worst hours in our history

4866726 despite the medias outragious attacks on my sanity intelligence and patriotism the emails and phone calls to my office have been 95 percent supportive of my request for a new investigation
4866727 now is the time for our elected officials to be held accountable now is the time for the media to be held accountable why arent the hard questions being asked we know there were numerous warnings of the events to come on september 11 vladimir putin president of russia delivered one such warning those engaged in unusual stock trades immediately before september 11 knew enough to make millions of dollars from united and american airlines certain insurance and brokerage firms stocks what did this administration know and when did it know it about the events of september 11 who else knew and why did they not warn the innocent people of new york who were needlessly murdered

4867003 virtually all of the major web 2 0 platforms goog yhoo iaci amzn ebay recognize how critical it is to engage their users in the act of media production and therefore are in different ways releasing apis that stream their consumers meta data
4867004 central then to the evaluation of an api is to what extent it performs high level operations on low level data and how interesting the ensuing abstractions are to a broad community of users
4867005 for any given page googles auction system compares how much money the brand advertisers are bidding to show an ad on that site to the amount that keyword advertisers have bid if someone clicks
4867006 not surprisingly it will display whatever ads will bring in the most money
4867007 this concerns you because at the end of the day nothing is more important than your relationship with marketers and your ability to control your own ad inventory
4867008 life is what you make it and if you make it death well rest your soul away away away
4867009 i dont believe participatory media threatens these values in any way
4867010 in fact the opposite i think a more participatory approach and relationship with audiences strengthens all of these values
4867011 for example in terms of truth and accuracy and impartiality and diversity of opinion these can only be strengthened by being open to more perspectives and the knowledge and understanding of the audience or users many argue that truth or impartiality are impossible to achieve im not sure i agree but i certainly believe that the attempt to achieve them raises standards and that reflecting a wide spread of opinion and perspectives is the best way to attempt to do so
4867012 what i think is changing is that for years the debate was largely about distribution of content that is how do we get our stories in front of readers and do it in a way that brings in money and doesnt upset traditional revenue models
4867013 any newspaper web site that limits itself to repurposing content from the paper is in serious trouble any newspaper site that fails to recognize the value of the papers brand and content is in serious trouble so there you have it im firmly and unequivocally ambivalent about this
4867014 if google generates as much in the final three quarters of the year as it did in the first its revenue for 2005 will top 5 billion most of that from advertising
4867015 grew up in a highly centralized world where news and information were tightly controlled by a few editors who deemed to tell us what we could and should know
4867016 in a world where national leaders are turning away from the news media citizens have an increasing lack of confidence in the press and young people are moving perhaps permanently away from traditional newsgathering organizations a radical rethinking of how news is delivered seems necessary even overdue
4867017 this is not theoretical it is not a drill the kinds of things we would expect to see if the newspaper industry had consciously chosen the profitable demise route are starting to show up in behavior
4867018 no r amp d rush no large investment in the future no siren call to find the new model
4867019 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

4867021 t echnology is transforming citizens from passive consumers of news produced by professionals into active participants who can assemble their own journalism from disparate elements
4867022 what does this mean for our site no news aggregation no news syndication no news on search engines no readers can find us no traffic add all this up and you can see the economic value of the site is gone so what to do now we have tried contacting google over and over we have deleted almost all afp content which we paid dearly for to try to appease them not a single answer back afp just says sorry

4867024 ramen noodle in miso based soup is called miso ramen its one of the popular flavors of ramen noodles in japan lots of vegetables can be added in this miso ramen recipe
4867025 the hand shaped chinese cabbage leaves when stuffed with ground pork are traditionally said to resemble the graceful hands of buddha this dish is steamed light and healthful
4867026 this popular one pot dish can be made with meat or vegetables and like most casseroles is easily varied there are many similar dishes throughout east asia but this one is made distinctively japanese by the addition of mirin and even more so if you use dashi for the cooking stock a terrific touch arbruage fried tofu is available precooked at japanese markets its slightly sweet firm well pressed tofu can be used as a substitute
4867027 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4867028 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4867029 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4867030 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4867031 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4867032 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4867033 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4867034 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4867035 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4867036 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4867037 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4867038 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4867039 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4867040 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4867041 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4867042 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4867043 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4867044 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4867045 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4867046 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4867047 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4867048 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4867049 no penile mutilation in my threads the penis is an object of worship not sacrifice
4867050 this stuff does not relate in any way to whats happening with black people
4867051 yeah its easy to give up identity when you got one
4867052 are marginal usually languishing at the interface of black and white cultures or thoroughly ensconced in euro american settings
4867053 postmodern culture with its decentered subject can be the space where ties are severed or it can provide the occasion for new and varied forms of bonding to some extent ruptures surfaces contextuality and a host of other happenings create gaps that make space for oppositional practices which no longer require intellectuals to be confined to narrow separate spheres with no meaningful connection to the world of every day
4867054 ex friends falling out with allen ginsberg lionel and diana trilling lillian hellman hannah arendt and norman mailer
4867055 no penile mutilation in my threads the penis is an object of worship not sacrifice
4867056 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4867057 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4867058 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4867059 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

4867064 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4867065 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4867066 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4867067 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4867068 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4867069 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4867070 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4867071 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4867072 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4867073 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4867074 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4867075 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4867076 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4867077 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4867078 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4867079 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4867080 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4867081 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4867082 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4867083 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4867084 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4867085 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4867086 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4867087 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4867088 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4867089 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

4867094 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

4867098 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4867099 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4867100 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4867101 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4867102 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4867103 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4867104 we regularly write page one stories about companies and industries that were slow to recognize a sea change in their businesses and sat by as spectators as their market share eroded
4867105 im here to tell you that the days of tweaking need to end we need to truly change and in a big hurry and change not only how we get people the news but how we present it and even how we define it
4867106 i look forward to the next 20 years i plan to spend as a journalist i fully intend to work like hell to reinvent a business that i love and that is a cornerstone of our free society
4867107 we are putting out a good newspaper some days its a great newspaper what in the world is wrong with those people for not reading it

4867119 in the world of political blogging bloggers are the new paparazzi and the traditional news media reporters and columnists are the new targets
4867120 the blog is an increasingly important tool for newsgathering and for maintaining a connection with the community or ecosystem of those that you report on that last part was the bit that surprised me as i started blogging it has made my print reporting interactive i write i publish and that used to be the end of it now i write i publish and a community of people who have special knowledge or who are deeply interested in the topic amplify correct modify or extend the reportage for a beat reporter this is fabulous because i now have more knowledge about my beat
4867121 as the united states activated navy ships and the air force to begin an airlift of non specified goods into the former soviet state of georgia and military exercises began in the persian gulf near iran i received communications from certain individuals among the colorado greens who were organizing campaign support events there suggesting that i not participate in an anti war program being organized by other individuals in colorado
4867122 im a little confused as to the medias portrayal of glenn spagnuolo and the members of re create 68 as violent extremists
4867123 the controversy seems to stem from re create 68s refusal to disallow the right to self defense to its members re create 68s explanation of this refusal is clear there will be people protesting with re create 68 arm in arm with their children and elders in large part these will be representatives of communities which have most suffered from the never ending betrayal of the democrats to attempt to deny them the right to defend themselves is to deny a fundamental human right
4867124 cynthia mckinney green party candidate for president and rosa clemente green party candidate for vice president are not participating in any recreate 68 activities both candidates and the green party of colorado are refuting this announcement and are stating that neither candidate nor the green party of colorado are in any way associated with recreate 68 nor will any of their candidates be speaking at or attending any event nor are they in any way associated with the group recreate 68
4867125 it gets to the issue of how comfortable are we training a generation of readers to get quality information for free that is troubling

4867184 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4867185 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4867186 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4867187 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4867188 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4867189 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4867190 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4867191 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4867192 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4867193 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4867194 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4867195 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4867196 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4867197 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4867198 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4867199 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4867200 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4867201 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4867202 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4867203 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4867204 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4867205 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4867206 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4867207 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4867208 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4867209 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4867210 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4867211 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4867212 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4867213 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4867214 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4867215 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4867216 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4867217 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4867218 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4867219 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4867220 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4867221 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4867222 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4867223 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4867224 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4867225 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4867226 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4867227 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4867228 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4867229 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4867230 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4867231 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4867232 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4867233 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4867234 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4867235 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4867236 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4867237 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4867238 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4867239 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4867240 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4867241 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4867242 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4867243 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4867244 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4867245 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4867246 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4867247 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4867248 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4867249 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4867250 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4867251 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4867252 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4867253 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4867254 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4867255 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4867256 who are open to doing something on the production side
4867257 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4867258 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4867259 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4867260 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4867261 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4867262 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4867263 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4867264 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4867265 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4867266 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4867267 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

4867288 the biggest technological shift since the rise of the television
4867289 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4867290 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4867291 is deliberately misrepresenting the facts about our plan in order to shift attention away from the democrats shameful record
4867292 her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices

4867306 el derecho es una idea pr ctica es decir que indica un fin como toda idea es tambi n una tendencia es esencialmente doble porque encierra en s una ant tesis el fin y el medio
4867307 a mi entender el derecho puede ser definido excatamente como un conjunto de normas en virtud de las cuales se ejerce la coerci n en un estado esta definiic n reafirma dos elementos la norma y su realizaci n por medio de la coerci n solamente los estautos sociales sancionados por la coercibilidad p blica constituyen derecho el estado es el soberano detentador de ese poder las prescripciones que l reviste de sanci n son las nicas normas jur dicas en otros t rminos el estado es la nica fuente de derecho
4867308 la lucha por el derecho es al mismo tiempo una lucha por la ley no se trata solamente de un inter s personal de un hecho aislado en que la ley toma cuerpo de daguerrotipo sino que se trata de que la ley se ha menospreciado y hollado y que debe ser defendida so pena de cambiarla en una frase vac a de sentido

4867352 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4867353 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4867354 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise

4867371 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
4867372 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4867373 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4867374 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists
4867375 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4867376 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4867377 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4867378 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4867379 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4867380 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4867381 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet

4867394 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4867395 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4867396 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4867397 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4867398 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4867399 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4867400 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4867401 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4867402 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4867403 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4867404 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4867405 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4867406 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4867407 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4867408 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4867409 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4867410 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4867411 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4867412 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4867413 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4867414 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4867415 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4867416 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4867417 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4867418 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4867419 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4867420 recycling is recycling glass should be included its not about making money its about making difference
4867421 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4867422 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4867423 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4867424 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4867425 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4867426 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4867427 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4867428 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4867429 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4867430 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4867431 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4867432 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4867433 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4867434 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4867435 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4867436 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4867437 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4867438 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4867439 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4867440 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4867441 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4867442 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4867443 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4867444 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4867445 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4867446 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4867447 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4867448 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4867449 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4867450 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4867451 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4867452 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4867453 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
4867454 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
4867455 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
4867456 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
4867457 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
4867458 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4867459 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4867460 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4867461 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4867462 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4867463 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4867464 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4867465 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4867466 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4867467 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4867468 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4867469 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4867470 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4867471 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4867472 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4867473 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4867474 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4867475 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
4867476 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4867477 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4867478 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4867479 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4867480 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4867481 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4867482 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4867483 just so you all know we did set a record
4867484 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4867485 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4867486 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4867487 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4867488 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4867489 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4867490 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4867491 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4867492 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4867493 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4867494 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4867495 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4867496 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4867497 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4867498 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4867499 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4867500 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4867501 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4867502 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4867503 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4867504 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4867505 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4867506 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4867507 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4867508 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4867509 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4867510 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4867511 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4867512 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4867513 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4867514 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4867515 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4867516 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4867517 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4867518 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4867519 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4867520 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4867521 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4867522 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4867523 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4867524 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4867525 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4867526 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4867527 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4867528 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4867529 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4867530 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4867531 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4867532 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4867533 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4867534 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4867535 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4867536 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4867537 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4867538 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4867539 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4867540 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4867541 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4867542 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4867543 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4867544 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4867545 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4867546 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
4867547 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
4867548 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
4867549 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4867550 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4867551 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4867552 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4867553 man kann die menschen durch das bewusstsein durch die religion durch was man sonst will von den tieren unterscheiden sie selbst fangen an sich von den tieren zu unterscheiden sobald sie anfangen ihre lebensmittel selbst zu produzieren ein schritt der durch ihre k rperliche organisation bedingt ist indem die menschen ihre lebensmittel produzieren produzieren sie indirekt ihr materielles leben selbst
4867554 wer arbeitet muss was zu essen haben wer nicht arbeitet braucht nichts essen
4867555 inzwischen verdienen die millionen menschen die pers nliche zuwendung verkaufen in zunehmendem ma e nicht mehr genug um selbst die dienstleistungen in anspruch nehmen zu k nnen die sie anbieten
4867556 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4867557 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4867558 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4867559 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4867560 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4867561 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4867562 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4867563 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4867564 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4867565 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4867566 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4867567 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4867568 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4867569 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4867570 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4867571 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4867572 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
4867573 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
4867574 meros e tolos e in teis devaneios tolos a me torturar

4867578 to be resende or to be rezende thats the question
4867579 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4867580 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4867581 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4867582 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4867583 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4867584 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4867585 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4867586 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4867587 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4867588 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4867589 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete

4867599 these figures are frightening for any parent across this state
4867600 there is only so much government can do and ultimately people must be responsible for their own actions
4867601 weve already had more than 200 people die on queensland roads this year with speeding a major factor in many of these crashes
4867602 these figures are frightening for any parent across this state
4867603 the first thing we need to do is quit trashing each other in meetings like this which i have not
4867604 bottom line facts are facts youre an elected official you cant wait until school starts to come up with a budget
4867605 this body was told in may that you would not have a budget that we were waiting to get real figures
4867606 were ready to go back to school tcaps are knocking on the door and i have to start with day one and push all year long to get covered what the state requires me to teach and im a week behind

4867631 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4867632 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4867633 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
4867634 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4867635 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4867636 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4867637 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4867638 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4867639 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4867640 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4867641 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4867642 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4867643 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4867644 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4867645 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4867646 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4867647 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4867648 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4867649 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4867650 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4867651 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4867652 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4867653 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4867654 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte

4867769 the thing that was disappointing and a lot of the reason the offense didnt move well in the red zone was too many penalties
4867770 you cant have penalties in the red zone we got penalties that throw us out of field goal range
4867771 in both scrimmages i felt we moved the ball between the 20s pretty well but our red zone and it amazes me because we were pretty good in the red zone last year

4867786 we make our own decisions about what we consider newsworthy
4867787 the nomination of the first african american presidential nominee after a bitter primary campaign and his efforts to unite a party afterward were simply more newsworthy than a candidate whose nomination was already assured and who spent much of that time raising money in the end we can and should be judged on the fairness of our coverage but that is a judgment that must be made over the course of the whole campaign not a single period of time
4867788 across the country doctors in emergency medicine will tell you knife crime has got out of hand
4867789 clear pattern with repeat offenders travelling from country to country and flagrantly avoiding the stringent sex offender management mechanisms in the uk
4867790 the government is turning a blind eye to the activities of british sex offenders abroad
4867791 britons who travel abroad to abuse children in the belief that they can evade justice are a uk problem and we have a duty to protect every child everywhere
4867792 from the autumn we also intend to make registered sex offenders notify the police of any travel abroad
4867793 and im not flying the flag for metrosexuality it just seemed a sensible idea at the time what we hadnt prepared ourselves for is just how old fashioned the rest of the world is
4867794 no box to tick on the marriage certificate as there is for a woman taking a mans name
4867795 it didnt seem an option instead my wife started receiving mysterious letters congratulating her on her marriage and name change
4867796 i always considered my friends to be pretty metropolitan but they too seemed to have problems coming to terms with it
4867797 they thought i was joking eventually i had to show them my new bank cards to get them to believe me they kept asking why people seemed vaguely disapproving as if we were breaking a sacred rule
4867798 modern weddings are not about a man owning a woman
4867799 i am marrying an independent person with her own mind her own life and her own job when i take on my wifes family name its a positive move forward as i believe women are equal to men if not slightly better
4867800 and what happens down the line our great great grandchildren could have been lumbered with eight surnames
4867801 obviously we are concerned about anything thats going to be problematic for the charity as things stand she remains a patron but were having a trustees meeting on 3 september and this will be on the agenda
4867802 i intend to seek the help that i very much need
4867803 cases such as these highlight that there are intrinsic weaknesses in the cps it is not only frustrating for police who detect and arrest crimes and criminals to then see sentencing and bail conditions undermine offences but soft sentencing for cases can send confusing messages to the public
4867804 if that had been an ordinary couple from a council estate they would have received a far greater sanction
4867805 the policy and practice surrounding conditional cautions is applied consistently to both rich and poor
4867806 we hope with all our hearts that hans and eva can overcome their addiction and we continue to do what we can to help
4867807 there will be no comment on a private family matter
4867808 its the most perfect place on earth and to think that there is talk of giving up sea defences and letting the sea reclaim this area is shameful along the walk is a derelict mill beside a river where you can watch marsh harriers and in the springtime you can hear bitterns booming
4867809 great beaches beach huts and all the usual seaside amenities without the crowds
4867810 lake wood is currently under threat from a potential develop ment of commercial units and as such it makes this site ever more significant in light of its possible destruction
4867811 absolutely lovely and looks just as stunning in winter as it does in summer it has secret nooks and crannies to explore is packed full of ideas to take home its also free for children to visit at the moment my niece and nephew loved the beatrix potter exhibition well worth a trip any time of year
4867812 and just a short drive from london are the chilterns which are home to englands largest population of red kites exit the m40 between junctions 4 and 7 and watch them gliding over the towns and villages of the chilterns which is an area of outstanding natural beauty plus its all free not a penny to pay

4867815 walk to the hermits cave in the woods visit the unique tiny church the only church in england which shares its roof with a farmhouse see the abbey ruins and the post mill if you go to dale abbey on a sunday afternoon you could attend the three oclock service in the tiny church and or take tea in the old chapel now the parish centre there is no charge but donations are invited
4867816 has a stream running through it with little bridges across rather like bourton on the water
4867817 drive through the ford to the pub known as the splash and a walk along the bank of the stream through the village

4867821 a work in progress by a life in progress is the third play ive written and in it i really wanted to talk about different things such as getting older
4867822 after edinburgh im going back to new york to do the celebrity apprentice the donald trump show with my daughter
4867823 im still enjoying life as much as i did the showbiz life is great everybody wants it everybody enjoys it theres no way im slowing down
4867824 i just do what ive got to do whatever happens in your life youve just got to keep yourself in the day and let it take care of itself
4867825 i came to do surviving spike after an agent passed me a script when i was sitting round a table at a social evening ive often done things not knowing if they would work out and then ive just added my stuff to it and it has
4867826 i am also a fan of spike which helps i interviewed him once on barrymore and he said to me youre off your chump i said thats rich coming from you
4867827 the play encompasses spikes depression as well so there are parallels with my life i suppose theres this misconception that comedians walk around smiling all the time so when youre not doing it theres just loss unless you keep yourself busy and then get that manic side of it when youre performing you get this flatness i get it sometimes i dont know where it comes from
4867828 i had actually retired for about the tenth time in my life
4867829 i have played the festival before but in the 1950s i was a dancer for a dance troupe and then i did it again a couple of years later
4867830 i think doing the festival might be good for ones career i do lead a different life living in america now but when i play here i can feel something inside me saying mmm maybe i should do this
4867831 i think a lot of people thought i was dead
4867832 its true that edinburgh is very good for your career the entire press depends on edinburgh but its absolutely pot luck as to what they see here theyre either tipped off by someone they know or just follow the course and really like it if theyre surprised by something new
4867833 i actually started my career at edinburgh in 1973 in a play called the thrie estates
4867834 its great as people are in a real holiday mode and they are all here to indulge in their filthy passion for theatre which is lovely ive found my audience to be very lovely and willing to be moved which is great
4867835 playing edinburgh has been great for my career to be honest initially i never dreamed of doing it as i didnt come up through the ranks of the art circuit but i was convinced to do it by someone i knew
4867836 because of the quick turn around you get to see your audience and i saw these people who had wonderful tattoos and piercings and looked liked they had come to see an original hazel oconnor show
4867837 part of my show is a kind of revenge in a comedy style aimed at the bastards that signed me to their record company i had real problems with them a few years ago
4867838 last year i did grumpy old women and my director for that show just asked me one day whether id thought of doing a one woman show
4867839 capture the imagination of young people and leave a lasting legacy
4867840 its time the government got a grip on the olympics and treated the legacy as equally important as hosting the games itself
4867841 once the olympic show has left town the power of london 2012 will wane the time to start getting people active is in the run up to the games not as organisers are packing up
4867842 just how old are those gymnasts anyways i have potato salad in my refrigerator that looks more mature
4867843 the roosevelt party ran on economic issues and didnt care whether voters were in favor of sex or against it on principle as long as they supported the new deal the mcgovern party by contrast has made social issues its litmus test economic conservatives have had a home in the mcgovern party as long as they support abortion rights and affirmative action but social democrats and populists who are pro life or anti affirmative action are not made nearly as welcome
4867844 beginning with its namesake george mcgovern in 1972 the mcgovern party has been trounced repeatedly by the nixon party not because of its economic agenda which the public actually prefers to the alternative but because of its unpopular stands on issues like race based affirmative action illegal immigration crime and punishment and national security
4867845 in fact the majority of americans including many social conservatives never ceased to support new deal policies which from social security and medicare to the g
4867846 note that almost all of the policy proposals that excite the american public are exactly the sort of old fashioned
4867847 a newer deal party that ran on this economic agenda could attract southern baptist creationists as well as marin county agnostics
4867848 id rather move to canada than share the democratic party with those people
4867849 unfortunately the upper middle class left with its unerring instinct for political suicide is probably incapable of seizing the moment and bringing more baptists and catholics into the democratic party because it has developed an almost superstitious distaste for religious conservatives
4867850 there would have been no progressive era without the followers of william jennings bryan and no new deal without the support of ancestors of many of todays protestant evangelicals and traditionalist catholics social conservatives having lost the culture war should be offered not only a truce but also an opportunity to join a broad economic campaign for a middle class america as many of them did between 1932 and 1968 when pro choicers and pro lifers unite in cheering the public investment and living wage planks at the convention of the neo roosevelt party we will know that the political era that began in 1968 is truly and finally over

4867867 as these additional security measures are taken the units of the russian armed forces that were sent into the zone of the south ossetian conflict will be withdrawn
4867868 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4867869 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4867870 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4867871 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4867872 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so

4867893 i told them it was a private party and to clear off but this big youth put his face right into mine and said make me
4867894 as i tackled him six of them came over the top of me i received a big hit to the side of my head
4867895 there were six or seven really big buff guys on top of my dad hitting him i had to try and pull him out
4867896 i am certainly not a hero i just defended my property and my sons friends there were a group of 15 year old girls there too
4867897 people have had enough this gang has been terrorising people whose kids are having parties for months now somebody needed to stand up to them
4867898 i know that if dad had not stood up to them they would have completely trashed the house and stolen anything they could get their hands on
4867899 all i would suggest if a situation arises again leave it to the police to handle

4867903 love is like a star you know touching it is impossible but you keep reaching hoping one day the star will fall for you
4867904 girls we love for what they are young men for what they promise to be
4867905 to get the full value of joy you must have somebody to divide it with
4867906 love is a little haven of refuge from the world
4867907 a love song is just a caress set to music
4867908 your capacity to love others is closely related to your ablility to love yourself
4867909 the heart has its reasons which reason knows nothing of
4867910 we discovered in each other and ourselves worlds galaxies a universe
4867911 when love beckons you follow him though his ways are hard and steep
4867912 love is like an hourglass with the heart filling up as the brain empties
4867913 the sound of a kiss is not so loud as that of a cannon but its echo lasts a great deal longer
4867914 take any form drive me mad only do not leave me in this abyss where i cannot find you
4867915 from success you get a lot of things but not that great inside thing that love brings you
4867916 we are each of us angels with only one wing and we can only fly embracing each other
4867917 one word frees us from the weight and pain of life that word is love
4867918 love demands the impossible the absolute the sky on fire inexhaustible springtime life after death and death itself transfigured into eternal life
4867919 there isnt any formula or method you learn to love by loving
4867920 affection is responsible for nine tenths of whatever solid and durable happiness there is in our lives
4867921 the madness of love is the greatest of heavens blessings
4867922 love does not consist in gazing at eachother but in looking outward together in the same direction
4867923 a beautiful woman is one i notice a charming woman is one who notices me
4867924 love is when you dont want to go to sleep because reality is better than a dream
4867925 anyone can be passionate but it takes real lovers to be silly
4867926 you shouldnt frown because you never know whos falling in love with your smile
4867927 when one relationship ends it just means you are one step closer to finding your true love
4867928 the opposite sex is the most dangerous and addictive drug out there but the high is unlike anything else
4867929 you never lose by loving you lose by holding back
4867930 love that we cannot have is one that lasts the longest hurts the deepest and feels the stongest
4867931 have you noticed that the worst way to miss someone is when they are right beside you and you cant have them
4867932 love is the like the sun comming out from the clouds and warming your soul
4867933 you can love anyone in the world but the problem is they can too
4867934 to love is to admire with the heart to admire is to love with the mind
4867935 i never thought love could be so magnificent until i saw the sincere look in your eyes telling me that this time i would never shed another tear
4867936 dont be blind to love dont move to fast at the end of the day destiny will place it in the palm of your hands its up to you if you want to take it
4867937 the world belongs to those who are loved and those who are loved have the world at their fingertips
4867938 love is giving someone the ability to destroy you and trusting them not to
4867939 the decision to kiss for the first time is the most crucial in any love story it changes the relationship of two people much more strongly than even the final surrender because this kiss already has within it that surrender
4867940 love is something that just happens you cant go searching for love but when love comes to you grab it and hold on to it forever because it might never come back to you
4867941 you never really know how beautiful something is until it cries
4867942 until there was you i didnt know what it was like to smile for no reason
4867943 meeting you was fate becoming your friend was a chioce but falling in love with you was beyond my control
4867944 love isnt finding a perfect person its seeing an imperfect person perfectly
4867945 to the world you might be one person but to one person you might be the world
4867946 love is like a ghost which everyone talks about but few have seen
4867947 love is only blind until you open up your eyes
4867948 absence is to love what wind is to fire it extinguishes the small and it enkindles the great

4867964 gordon could come through the party conference have a successful relaunch and get back on track only to throw it all away by losing a by election in november
4867965 we should do it now before the mps are back at westminster if we lost in november with mps all back no one knows what would happen
4867966 he should do it as quickly as possible it is clear that the longer you leave it the more momentum the snp will get
4867967 we have been in fruitful discussion with the health and education authorities and we are satisfied that the programme to be rolled out across the country now is a responsible and ethically appropriate one
4867968 we wanted to make sure any support materials were appropriate in the catholic schools and we didnt want hpv and cervical cancer to be linked with artificial contraception the factual information about the vaccine and cervical cancer are still there but it doesnt promote particular kinds of sexual behaviour we had discussions about it we looked at various forms of words and came to an agreement it took some months
4867969 the hpv vaccination will only protect young women from two strains of hpv leading to cervical cancer it is critically important that young people understand the need to use condoms to protect them from other stis
4867970 this message should be highlighted and underlined please remember this injection doesnt protect you from sexually transmitted diseases or becoming pregnant
4867971 the moral position is being imposed upon them it seems a bit archaic to let the catholic church decide on this
4867972 the hpv vaccine is about saving lives and protecting future generations of young girls from cervical cancer
4867973 scottish government officials consulted with many stakeholders and undertook research with parents and girls to ensure the right level of information was included in the leaflet the scottish government is absolutely committed to promoting safer sex and we are taking forward our sexual health strategy respect and responsibility
4867974 we did have an incident which took place with a small number of people but the majority of people who have come here today behaved impeccably
4867975 we have thrown our weight behind this because we think theres a difference between free speech and free expression and attacking someone for the colour of their skin or their sexual orientation
4867976 the bnp stands for everything that we are not we are here as a trade union to promote unity for the betterment of working men and working women and the bnp stand for attacking those who have different colour skin from their own
4867977 i support the anti fascists the bnp should never have been allowed here in the first place
4867978 would you mind moving a little bit to the left
4867979 one of the first pupils to benefit from comprehensive education in ayrshire
4867980 but the point about it was that it actually reinforced that i was good at this there was excitement and a level of achievement
4867981 as time went on i found myself becoming more and more interested in social issues
4867982 i enjoy as much as anybody looking in art galleries at different things because it gives you a different perspective on life but i think we can do more with it than that
4867983 community art and how we use art as part of a regeneration process for communities
4867984 i come from a pretty straightforward working class community and i have shared the kind of experiences that people in those communities have why would that make me any less able to be a politician
4867985 actually i think it is an advantage because it does allow me to understand where people have come from and what their hopes and aspirations are
4867986 it doesnt sit at odds with a principled position if you take the view that communities shouldnt be abandoned to people involved in anti social behaviour that people should be able to see people on the streets and prisoners need to have staff in there working with them
4867987 i would hope that gordon and people around him will recognise that this is the first time every member of the labour party and all the affiliates have their chance to put their name on the ballot paper
4867988 on the one hand they are saying this is great but on the other they are saying where has the summer gone
4867989 i came into this knowing it was going to be tough i was very clear about what i was letting myself in for but this time around i felt the party needed a contest and i was determined to play my part in that
4867990 it could not be more obvious that the work of the scotland funds did indeed link to the scottish governments strategic objectives
4867991 as is the case with all funding applications a robust business case must be provided demonstrating the merit of the project and linking to the scottish governments strategic objectives
4867992 fco the foreign office contacted me about that mathers proposed meeting and i re supplied the lines about this being a matter for uk ministers
4867993 the article said that jim mather would meet norwegian ministers to discuss in october so i suggested that our post in norway should make sure that their opposite numbers were clear about uk responsibilities
4867994 the generation transmission distribution and supply of electricity are reserved matters under the scotland act 1998 as are international relations it is for the uk government to take any decisions and deal with other countries in relation to those matters
4867995 berr is proving to be the single biggest obstacle to scotland fulfilling our renewable energy potential not only have they refused to act to counter unfair connection charges imposed on generators in scotland over a period of years now they are actively undermining the building of transmission systems
4867996 this memo consolidates berrs reputation as the worst department in the uk government a failure as far as scotland is concerned the uk government rakes in oil billions but gives nothing in return it is the department that likes to say no to scotland

4868349 in the summer of 1977 jones and most of the 1 000 members of the peoples temple moved to from san francisco after an investigation into the church for tax evasion was begun jones named the closed settlement jonestown after himself his intention was to create an agricultural in the jungle free from racism and based on quasi communist principles jones told his followers to think of him as the incarnation of god his followers were known to perform sex acts on him in front of the entire congregation while the children watched they were fed mushrooms creating a feverish psychedelic environment
4868350 he refused to allow a tempestuous political climate to cloud his vision for what he felt he needed to accomplish
4868351 at the end of the day hes going to take heat no matter what

4868383 this is a primer on sibel edmonds her story will be of interest to anyone concerned about us national security and sovereignty terrorism 9 11 truth and abuse of power by public officials all claims of fact in this article can be sourced in the sibel edmonds us government timeline and the media coverage timeline at the bottom of the article her allegations listed in this article and the documents articles linked in the timelines are not exhaustive

4868385 intentionally and repeatedly thwarted his attempts to launch a more comprehensive investigation to identify and neutralize terrorists
4868386 was merely gathering intelligence so they would know who to arrest when a terrorist attack occurred
4868387 the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states ended its report stating that
4868388 the 9 11 commission thats all a fallacy the 9 11 commission is probably the worst representation of the 9 11 families or for that matter the american public because it is a sham it really is we had tons of questions that we asked them to ask they wouldnt do it and the continuing coverup is just beyond belief
4868389 a thorough and definitive investigation by the commission would have addressed all of sibel edmonds concerns and spoken to all of the whistleblowers it would have subpoenaed for the information it required and examined the plethora of information that other citizens and groups responsible provided and finally without compromising our national security it would have reported all of its findings with its redactions blacked out and submitted to the american people in essence the commission could have produced a final product where the resulting conclusions and recommendations could be trusted instead at the end of the day what we got were some statements that truly insulted the intelligence of the american people violated our loved ones memories and might end up hurting us one day soon one such statement is that 9 11 was a failure of imagination a failure of whose imagination what exactly does that mean when you have a cia director with his hair on fire a system blinking red 52 faa warnings an august 6th 2001 pdb entitled bin laden determined to strike in the united states leads on several 9 11 hijackers including alhazmi almihdhar and marwan al shehi warnings from many foreign governments a phoenix memo warning of islamic extremists taking flying lessons the arrest of would be terrorist zacarias moussauoui facts imparted to one agent agent frasca at the rfu at the fbi 9 11 was truly a failure alright
4868390 it is clear that zelikow should never have been permitted to be a member of the commission since it is the mandate of the commission to identify the source of failures we can now see that trail would lead directly to the staff director himself
4868391 i dont have ideas exactly on how 9 11 happened but i know it didnt go as according to what the commission put down on paper and one of the reasons why we still continued to fight with for the commission even as we knew it was a farce is we wanted their words their lies down on paper we wanted to make them go through at least this exercise and even if it came down to the annals of history that the truth will come out that was part of our purpose our purposes were layered well be a pain in the butt thats fine well get their lies down on paper well have more americans wake up to the fact that their government is not looking out for their best interests in fact they may be counter to our best interests but none of this would have come to this point if in fact the commission didnt exist at all
4868392 with regard to the 9 11 attacks it has been said that the intelligence agencies have to be right 100 of the time and the terrorists only have to get lucky once this explanation for the devastating attacks of september 11th simple on its face is wrong in its value because the 9 11 terrorists were not just lucky once they were lucky over and over again allow me to illustrate
4868393 is it luck that aberrant stock trades were not monitored is it luck when 15 visas are awarded based on incomplete forms is it luck when airline security screenings allow hijackers to board planes with box cutters and pepper spray is it luck when emergency faa and norad protocols are not followed is it luck when a national emergency is not reported to top government officials on a timely basis to me luck is something that happens once when you have this repeated pattern of broken protocols broken laws broken communication one cannot still call it luck if at some point we dont look to hold the individuals accountable for not doing their jobs properly then how can we ever expect for terrorists not to get lucky again
4868394 one particular aspect of the report that is quite troubling to me and my organization is the discussion relating to the evacuation orders of the north tower on pages 322 323 of the report and the corresponding endnote numbers 209 it is alleged that many of the firefighters in the north tower heard the message to evacuate but chose to remain in the building prior to its collapse to the contrary this issue of firefighter deaths is directly tied to the lack of radio communication capability this has been well documented in the post 9 11 mckinsey report the ny times and numerous other publications and firefighter comments yet this theory that firefighters chose to die has also been advanced by some public officials undoubtedly hoping to deflect criticism for the inadequacy of the fdny radios and for the absence of a functioning incident command structure in nyc on 9 11 which undoubtedly could have saved so many firefighters lives including my own beautiful son christian
4868395 it is a national scandal the warren commission blew it im not going to be part of that im not going to be part of looking at information only partially im not going to be part of just coming to quick conclusions im not going to be part of political pressure to do this or not do that

4868444 the ministry looks at missionary schools as an important asset a school for all regardless of race and religion many ministers are the product of missionary schools so the grants to upkeep these schools are timely as most are several decades old
4868445 the improper storage of food leads to the food being contaminated by the time it is served
4868446 many a time the food handlers do not follow the right practices such as washing their hands properly after going to the toilet and so contaminate the food
4868447 school authorities and food outlets must ensure that there are proper amenities in the kitchen to prepare and store food use clean dishes and utensils when making or serving food
4868448 in islam anyone can swear that they are telling the truth but they do not have to hold the quran
4868449 its just a gimmick i dont think it is right for saiful to do especially so now that the case is in court one cannot do something that could influence the outcome of a case this is certainly on the verge of contempt
4868450 anwar should also be doing the same thing to prove his innocence
4868451 yes we will only charge this accused person and this other person the complainant will be the witness
4868452 these people have breached the law you didnt protect us so we decided to take the law into our hands
4868453 three means hill and it looks like bn is going to the peak in this contest
4868454 it is okay i am banking on the support of the people whom i know very well
4868455 what matters is the numbers we get on polling day
4868456 the bn is going all out to ensure i do not get elected and go on to become a member of parliament
4868457 however it is not the bn which is going to decide but the people
4868458 we have many smart people but they cant seem to solve these problems
4868459 non muslims would be consulted there is no need to fear it will not be done arbitrarily
4868460 we need more consultation in states like perak which have a mixed population and is governed by the dap pkr and pas
4868461 for the ulama we want to eradicate gambling but if it cannot be done away with it should be reduced
4868462 pas has no qualms about non muslims consuming alcohol because it is acceptable to them
4868463 it does not mean we condone abuse of alcohol and gambling but why go and impose your sort of thinking on others
4868464 we voluntarily stopped the exports until we determine the needs and conditions set by the eu
4868465 we are not hard headed on this issue but the statement is 100 per cent wrong we can accept criticisms if what was said was true
4868466 i dont know where they get the figures which are inaccurate and misleading
4868467 horse milk has a very high content of vitamins and minerals
4868468 at first we were supplying the milk in liquid form but some of our consumers could not take the smell and taste of the milk which is a bit sour
4868469 we had a golden opportunity in march to showcase our openness
4868470 but she kumutha was forced to use the pkr ticket because our partys constitution did not allow her to use the partys name
4868471 the club is an important element in pas political struggle
4868472 in it we have non muslims who understand what pas stands for and who have thrown their support behind the party
4868473 therefore pas leadership must take the necessary steps to give due recognition to the club by allowing its non muslim members to fight in elections on a pas ticket
4868474 this industry offers attractive returns on investment to the breeders as the overall production cost is low
4868475 what image are we portraying when we condemn concerts like sure heboh the non muslims are thinking that pas doesnt like this doesnt like that
4868476 the best way for pas to attract non muslims to align with the party is to follow the way of prophet muhammad he never used the harsh approach in spreading the message of islam
4868477 fear or harsh tactics do not work they scare people away change the approach and more non muslims will support the party
4868478 we must rejuvenate the culture of intellectualism in pas which has weakened over time because the party had neglected the education tarbiah aspect among its members
4868479 more importantly the muslim voters will not be afraid to vote for pakatan
4868480 of course the working relationship between pas and dap has improved since the general election but members are still not comfortable with the rocket
4868481 the best solution is to find a common symbol to represent all three parties in the pakatan
4868482 we will take action against those who incite racial hatred or those who overreact
4868483 we can accept a few exchanges here and there but not to such an extent
4868484 compared to 20 years ago the civil defence department has undergone changes and is more experienced in facing new challenges especially disasters
4868485 i believe the department has taken steps to ensure proper training is given to officers to achieve high standards among its officers
4868486 the incident began as a quarrel and went bad when the suspect reached for an axe and slashed the victim a few times before running off with some money and jewellery
4868487 the police team managed to track the suspect at 2am about a few metres from the victims house and recovered the weapon as well as the money and jewellery
4868488 everyone get out take only the stairs so that we can see that all of you vacate this building
4868489 can you imagine the house youve been living in for 30 years is declared not your house
4868490 the cause anti apartheid for which i am prepared to die
4868491 i dont know how i did it i just went in to play my game and i somehow won i think the new scoring system suits my game better as i also beat sharon for the first time
4868492 we will have a better idea after the police complete their investigation
4868493 of all the youth football competitions in the country presently the 100plus super champions schools tournament is unique as unlike most events which involve state teams this tournament is specifically for schools which have developed strong football teams
4868494 he kissed the malaysian flag on his t shirt and hugged his coach former champion misbun sidek in celebration of the hard won success
4868495 we should not hold one episode of misbehaviour against a person
4868496 if he endeavours to change and has proven that he is back on the right path he should be given another opportunity to serve the people
4868497 after all who are we to judge everyone has good and bad points
4868498 we should not hold this against him if he can contribute
4868499 what is the point of having an unblemished character when the person cannot deliver
4868500 it would make a lot of difference if the stories were not played up
4868501 if you havent even opened those boxes in two years you obviously dont need anything inside them throw out the whole lot
4868502 politicians make all kinds of promises in the run up to elections they have to keep them and also discharge their responsibilities
4868503 thats what being a moral politician means and for many people it is crucial that this criterion is fulfilled
4868504 it is not that someone who has been involved in a sex scandal shows that he is less capable dr chua for example was seen as a capable health minister but his credibility among the public and his party members had decreased to a point that he could not command the respect of his peers and the public
4868505 but once a person is caught red handed there is no excuse and he would have to accept the consequences
4868506 some things in life are absolutely right and some things are absolutely wrong there is black and white in life
4868507 what was right for me might not be right for you
4868508 that may be true when it comes to picking the colour of the shirt we are going to wear or the tie we are going to buy but it is not true when it comes to honesty and integrity
4868509 we should not hold one episode of misbehaviour against a person if he endeavours to change and has proven that he is back on the right path he should be given another opportunity to serve the people after all who are we to judge everyone has good and bad points we should not hold this against him if he can contribute
4868510 what is the point of having an unblemished character who cannot deliver
4868511 it would make a lot of difference if the stories were not played up
4868512 not giving official guidance to the public yet about the next version of windows other than that were working on it when we are ready we will provide updates
4868513 starting on august 14 2008 steven sinofsky leading the windows group jon devaan leading windows engineering and the windows engineers are co authors of a new blog that is specifically focusing on the coming wave of client technology in windows 7 it is a treasure to get direct from the horses mouth information about what is reality and what is vapor when discussing windows 7
4868514 microsoft might be trying to accomplish by maintaining a little bit more control over the communication around windows 7 some might say that this is a significant understatement we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk again top of mind for us is the responsibility we feel to make sure we are not stressing priorities churning resource allocations or causing strategic confusion among the tens of thousands of partners and customers who care deeply and have much invested in the evolution of windows
4868515 windows has all the challenges of every large scale software project picking features designing them developing them and delivering them with high quality windows has an added challenge of doing so for an extraordinarily diverse set of customers as a team and as individuals on the team we continue to be humbled by this responsibility we strongly believe that success for windows 7 includes an open and honest and two way discussion about how we balance all of these interests and deliver software on the scale of windows
4868516 the air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water food electricity and gas horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased looking for supplies
4868517 we will caution them against continuing to further support of saakashvili
4868518 it is an undisguised aggression accompanied by a mass propaganda war
4868519 it all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by georgia during several years now we see how these arms and georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign and u s specialists are used
4868520 it concerns not only georgia it concerns the u s and its values we are a freedom loving country which is being attacked
4868521 we ask our friends including the u s to be mediators and try persuading russia to stop this military aggression and incursion into georgia
4868522 it is the third genocide of the ossetian people from the side of georgia and saakashvili is the main murderer
4868523 irrespective of the development of situation in south ossetia we wont stop moving to the border with georgia today they launch a military aggression against south ossetia and tomorrow it could be abkhazia it cannot go on like that
4868524 we are extremely concerned with the latest developments and we think that it is very regrettable that there has been loss of lives the most urgent thing at the moment is to calm the situation down
4868525 i was telling rodney that as far as rock amp roll was concerned we were in a pussy period
4868526 a pussy period is when music sounds like a guy who was breast fed until the age of twelve playing a twenty thousand dollar guitar with mittens on while the sound engineer squeezes his balls with one hand and cools em with a chinese fan with the other
4868527 what do you think rock amp roll should sound like
4868528 i think rock amp roll should sound like a wad of jagged steel rolling down the highway spitting hot glass onto broken rocks and at the center of this the nucleus of this is the softest woman the world has ever seen open motherly arms and just a whiff of sex

4868537 the seers through the yoga union of perception let plants speak to them and the plants disclosed their secrets many of which are far more subtle than a chemical analysis could uncover to become a true herbalist therefore means to become a seer this means to be sensitive to the being of the herbs to commune in receptive awareness with the plant light of the universe it is to learn to listen when the plant speaks to speak to the plant as to another human being and to look upon it as ones teacher

4868544 on the 197th birthday of charles darwin ministers at several hundred churches around the country preached yesterday against recent efforts to undermine the theory of evolution asserting that the opposition many christians say exists between science and faith is false
4868545 this is simply untrue even though humans are the product of evolution humans are still special in gods eyes god manipulated the evolutionary process in some magical way to divinely create human beings and god magically gives each human being a soul at conception
4868546 a mythical supernatural being reaches in right here and guides it
4868547 you have just won a dream fast pass as part of the disney year of a million dreams giveaway
4868548 steering the course of grp milf peace negotiations for the sake of us interests
4868549 in 2003 the us state department engaged the usip to facilitate a peace agreement between the grp and the milf
4868550 despite the challenges usip managed to build productive relationships with both the grp and milf helped the parties come up with creative solutions to stubborn issues of ancestral domain and started dialogue between disparate moro ethnic groups through its activities usip introduced concepts and approaches that were useful to both government and milf peace panels
4868551 the usip advocated an ancestral domain arrangement that would remain friendly with u s interests
4868552 it is interested solely or mainly in advancing u s interests amidst conditions of armed conflict it merely pretends to facilitate the grp milf peace negotiations when its sees big advantages in doing so
4868553 todays complex diplomatic landscape increasingly requires new tools and techniques of conflict management including quasi and nongovernmental actors to accomplish u s foreign policy goals because of its ability to deal with non state actors and sensitive issues underlying civil conflict usip can be a useful instrument for advancing u s interests
4868554 the filipino people know that the u s covets the oil and other natural resources of mindanao and wants to establish u s military bases there to protect u s imperial interests
4868555 you have to create national consciousness among the majority of the people
4868556 at this point florida could be hit by a weak tropical storm or by a category 3 hurricane and these scenarios are about equally plausible
4868557 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4868558 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4868559 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4868560 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4868561 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4868562 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4868563 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4868564 my biggest assumption is whoever got the snake got cold feet and brought it back
4868565 i would really like to figure out who did this and why they did this

4868581 british law enforcement has the tools to protect children abroad they just dont use them
4868582 sends a strong message to so called sex tourists that they wont get away with targeting other countries with less strict controls than the uk
4868583 from the autumn we also intend to make registered sex offenders notify the police of any travel abroad
4868584 which sets standards to ensure that countries criminalise the sexual exploitation and abuse of children and adopt similar standards of investigation
4868585 we will also take any further action that is necessary and believe these changes that we have made will see the number of sex offenders prosecuted increase

4868596 acho at que tivemos uma boa atua o mas erramos demais a ltima bola
4868597 acho at que tivemos uma boa atua o mas erramos demais a ltima bola criamos as jogadas e poder amos ter feito gols no primeiro tempo mas no finalzinho come amos a fazer liga es diretas e isso n o poderia acontecer
4868598 nossos volantes ficaram de costas para o zagueiro e a bola come ou a bater e voltar pois o herrera n o pode jogar virado de costas para o gol isso facilitou a marca o do am rica
4868599 pedi tranq ilidade e que mantivessem a organiza o foi o que a gente fez aceleramos um pouco mais e fomos criando at marcar o gol que nos deu a calma para continuar a partida
4868600 quando o torcedor vaia o t cnico n o precisa ser muito veemente ele faz o caminho inverso conversa a equipe foi superior tomou iniciativa a grande mudan a para o segundo tempo foi o aparecimento dos gols que deram tranq ilidade para jogar
4868601 achei a rea o normal pois quando os gols n o aparecem a torcida vaia pois eles querem ver o time ganhando
4868602 n o podemos reclamar de nada do nosso torcedor mas naturalmente o corintiano um pouco impaciente
4868603 quando a equipe n o deslancha acaba sendo criada uma certa impaci ncia mas um jogador como o douglas que tem a capacidade de definir o jogo em um lance tamb m tem o direito de errar quem n o arrisca n o cria nada diferente
4868604 eu sempre tive confian a que ele se recuperaria das fases dif ceis o lulinha muito jovem e s vezes fica um pouco inst vel por isso acaba tentando complicar lances f ceis estamos trabalhando para que seja mais constante e mais decisivo
4868605 tratamos o lulinha da mesma maneira que o douglas com quem temos trabalhado para que entre mais na rea seja um jogador mais completo o douglas vem sendo decisivo nos ltimos jogos e esperamos que o lulinha venha a ser assim tamb m

4868613 i dont want to have a 9 to 5 job
4868614 and im happy to be back but this is something i wanted to do for me
4868615 i made a promise to myself that i would never be like those dancers those painters those writers who were always starving and living from job to job since i was a teenager i made this decision that i was going to be a professional
4868616 im obviously in favor of including latino artists in mainstream museums and its something we should see more of
4868617 but one thing that i learned at molaa is that you have to define your mission if youre able to specialize you can do the job better
4868618 if i wanted to take this to another level i could not continue playing it safe the goal of my life is not to become the director of a museum i want to be mick jagger
4868619 the 65 000 new donors to the obama campaign demonstrate just how strongly the american people are looking to fundamentally change business as usual in washington we are proud of the millions of volunteers and more than two million donors to the obama campaign who will provide the backbone of our campaign to put america back on track and reject the old politics and failed bush policies which is all john mccain is offering
4868620 its going to be a tough last six weeks because if we dont see our england players it is really going to test the depth of our squad
4868621 rob ferley will have to bear the brunt of our spin bowling duties but it will give some players the chance to shine
4868622 a lot depends on the champions trophy if it goes ahead and england agree to go we probably wont see swann sidebottom broad and potentially patel for the rest of the year if it doesnt we may have all of them available though not necessarily sidebottom as hes centrally contracted it could be vital to have them back for the last two games
4868623 i cant heap enough praise on our seam attack particularly shreck and pattinson
4868624 the reason we are top of the table is because of the way our seamers have bowled we havent batted as well as wed have liked there have been some good individual performances but we used to pride ourselves on making big first innings scores
4868625 this year we have relied on our bowlers to do the business shreck would bowl for you all day and pattinson ignoring the brouhaha about his england call up has been a wonderful signing for us at the start of the season we targeted being in the mix with one month to go if we are still up there at the end of august ill be very happy
4868626 sometimes i drink red bull thats only when im desperate when i need some serious artificial stimulation
4868627 says things i dont agree with in a non fawning tone of voice
4868628 i think we have an understanding of the type of player he is we havent watched him on a daily basis this year or even last year so you give him a couple looks if he looks like he can help us he gets a little more playing time

4868650 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4868651 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so

4868684 at best it seemed to me jesus was engaged in a kind of supernatural war game where though from a certain distance the action looked and sounded real enough no one was in any

4868717 traditionally banks and resource stocks were positively correlated if one sector went up so would the other
4868718 what you saw was a short squeeze with bears closing out their positions
4868719 we had all the shenanigans surrounding bradford amp bingley the rescue of housebuilder barratt and the hbos rights issue that city institutions bailed out the b amp b rights issue at a price of 55p when the shares were trading at 35p was absolutely bonkers there are also still plenty of questions about barratt and the valuation of its land bank which allowed it to renegotiate its finances
4868720 our interpre tation of this was that a major bank or housebuilder would not be allowed to fail because of the chain of events a collapse could trigger corporate corpses are being kept alive on a drip feed of capital in that scenario short sellers have nowhere to go
4868721 there are signs that supply and demand could be closer together than in recent times
4868722 people are buying smaller cars that are cheaper to run for example while on the supply side responses from the likes of the saudis seem to be having more effect than some had predicted
4868723 oil and the us dollar are having a temporary respite but overriding factors for high oil will return long term trends and asian demand will make the energy play good for the long term china will use 20 million barrels a day by 2020 about the same as the us uses today now is a good time to get into some en ergy stocks and funds

4868733 the various impediments on the ground in terms of very high rentals and poor infrastructure have obviously put a dampener on many of the grand plans that foreign players had for india
4868734 the reason is that there have been a lot of delays in setting up real estate projects getting properties on time and getting the fitouts done
4868735 the level of patience we have as indians is a lot higher than people have when they come in from outside
4868736 recent fuel hikes food increases and rental demands are forcing people to find further ways of affording lifes essentials
4868737 dithering darling has shown himself to be inept instead of helping the market what he has done is stop anybody from doing anything why would anyone try to buy or sell a house now if they think there are cuts to come

4868743 a sheriff in monroe county named al skinner called up strong and wanted to know if barb was there the sheriff said that he had heard a lot about her and he came down to strong to talk to her he wanted her to take care of his sister who unfortunately was nearing the end of her life every night barb would get picked up in a patrol car and taken to where skinners sister was after she was done caring for his sister skinner would take her home
4868744 i told her people were going to think she was getting in trouble getting picked up by the police every night
4868745 she actually talked a gentleman off of the water tower at the va center the man was ready to jump and she went up there talked to him for three or four hours and convinced him to come down
4868746 she loved myrtle beach because she could sit up on the balcony and hear the ocean
4868747 she would always sleep with the windows open so she could hear the ocean
4868748 when i hadnt seen her in a while i would start thinking that it was time to see barb
4868749 i hope that someday somebody might have thoughts about me the way that i think about her
4868750 but heck you never know geoff blum might get some with ty wigginton playing third well go erstad and bourn in the outfield kind of deal so well just mix and match like weve been doing thats what we have to do
4868751 but at least now ive got another guy that swings the bat off the bench if i got to play loretta i got a legitimate righthanded hitter before we had basically a switch hitter blummy was a switch hitter if i played lo and lo was playing i had to use blum from the right side this gives me another guy just another option

4868758 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4868772 is het goed dat de olympische spelen nu in china worden gehouden kunnen de spelen zoals sommigen zeggen het breekijzer vormen voor een doorbraak op het gebied van mensenrechten en persvrijheid ik denk het niet er zijn tot nu toe geen tekenen dat de komst van de spelen de persvrijheid in china voor chinese journalisten heeft vergroot er is eerder sprake van een verkleining van hun speelruimte dat hoeft ook eigenlijk niemand te verbazen als je kijkt naar chinas gedrag in het verleden de chinese overheid houdt de pers altijd strakker in de hand in de aanloop naar belangrijke offici le gebeurtenissen dat is ook nu weer te zien in de aanloop naar het partijcongres in oktober bij gezichtsbepalende gebeurtenissen mogen de media veel minder en worden dissidenten onder huisarrest geplaatst of tijdelijk naar buiten de stad verbannen alleen voor buitenlandse journalisten lijkt er iets verbeterd in de periode rond de spelen mogen zij spreken met alle chinezen en chinese organisaties die daar toestemming voor geven dat is anders dan vroeger toen moest de overheid eerst toestemming geven voordat je welke chinees dan ook mocht interviewen de nieuwe regels hebben als groot voordeel dat je niet meer per definitie in overtreding bent als je iemand interviewt nadeel blijkt wel dat je ook nooit meer duidelijke toestemming krijgt van de overheid om iets w l te doen in de praktijk zijn er ook weinig chinezen die het risico willen nemen om op eigen gezag iets te zeggen ze zijn bang dat het achteraf toch op represailles van de overheid komt te staan als ze iets verkeerds zeggen propaganda apparaat en er is nog een veel fundamentelere reden waarom de spelen niet zullen leiden tot grotere persvrijheid in haar rapport van 7 september van dit jaar trekt sophie richardson directeur azi van human rights watch de intenties van de chinese overheid in twijfel het lijkt erop dat de chinese overheid persvrijheid eerder ziet als een vijand dan als een waakhond op het gebied van de openbare veiligheid en de sociale stabiliteit ze raakt daarmee aan de kern ik denk niet dat de chinese overheid gelooft dat persvrijheid goed is voor china bij een sterke staat hoort een sterk propaganda apparaat en dat is de centrale taak van de media in china zij moeten bij de eigen bevolking en in het buitenland steun kweken voor het beleid van de overheid de partij werkt daartoe met voorschriften aan de media waarover ze wel en niet mogen berichten en over wat de inhoud van de berichten moet zijn chinese burgers zijn eerst en vooral onderdanen ondergeschikten ook zij verhouden zich tot de autoriteiten als kinderen tot hun ouders de ouders dienen in het belang van hun kinderen te handelen maar je kunt het kinderen niet toevertrouwen om op grond van alle beschikbare informatie zelfstandig tot een verstandige keuze te komen je kunt ze daarom ook maar beter afschermen van informatie waar ze niets mee kunnen en waar ze alleen maar onrustig van worden het is daarom een illusie te denken dat de olympische spelen een wezenlijke verandering in de houding van de chinese overheid teweeg zullen brengen integendeel rond de spelen zal de controle op de chinese media veel strenger zijn dan normaal omdat zij juist in die tijd hun rol als boodschappers van de chinese overheid foutloos en met verve moeten vervullen van het internationaal olympisch comit ioc valt op dat gebied geen heil te verwachten ook het ioc is gebaat bij enthousiasme harmonie en zo veel mogelijk aandacht voor sport en zo min mogelijk voor de controversi le aspecten van de spelen ik geloof niet dat china stapje voor stapje toegroeit naar een vrije pers op dezelfde manier waarop het land zich stapje voor stapje heeft omgevormd van een centraal geleide op communistische leest geschoeide economie naar een economie die zowaar behoorlijk op een vrijemarkteconomie begint te lijken tenminste niet onder de huidige regering de huidige chinese leiders streven daar helemaal niet naar deng xiaoping 1904 1997 zette de economische hervormingen eind jaren zeventig in met het doel om de communistische eenpartijstaat in china te versterken niet om die te verzwakken en zeker niet om die om te vormen naar een meerpartijendemocratie naar westers model china heeft kort gezegd helemaal geen vrije pers nodig om aan de eigen chinese maatstaven voor een modern land te voldoen ik heb af en toe iets gezien van hoe de overheid de media aanstuurt in 1998 ben ik naar china gekomen voor een veel comfortabeler baan dan die van journalist ik werkte in de buurt van shanghai op een kantoor dat was opgezet om de nederlandse export naar china te bevorderen bij de opening van dat kantoor was ook de vice gouverneur van de provincie aanwezig hij werd tijdens het banket gestoord door een bescheiden naast hem neerknielende journalist die vroeg hem om het stukje goed te keuren dat hij over de opening van het kantoor had geschreven de vice gouverneur pakte zijn pen kraste hier en daar wat in de tekst vulde wat aan en gaf het stuk aan de journalist terug die leverde de herziene versie in bij zijn krant braver kun je het niet hebben kritische verhalen toch en dat is heel verrassend zijn het juist chinese journalisten die met de meest interessante kritische en onthullende verhalen komen over wat er in china gebeurt toen ik in china zat kreeg ik de echt mooie idee n voor verhalen altijd van mijn chinese assistent hij spreekt geen engels en hij haalt zijn informatie louter uit de chinese staatsmedia maar hij kwam met het verhaal van arme boeren die door de plaatselijke regering waren overgehaald om hun geld te steken in de exploitatie van oliebronnen toen de olie eenmaal was gevonden en de olieprijzen stegen werden zij met grof geweld gedwongen om hun bronnen tegen verlies terug te verkopen aan de overheid hoe kunnen zulke kritische verhalen in de chinese staatspers belanden de eerste verklaring is dat de overheid wil dat bepaalde misstanden naar buiten komen de onthullingen in de media en de verontwaardiging bij het publiek maken het de overheid namelijk makkelijker om bepaalde misstanden ook echt aan te pakken de chinese overheid kan veel makkelijker functioneren als de bevolking haar politiek steunt als de overheid bijvoorbeeld iets moeilijk grijpbaars als de handel in vrouwen of de abortus van wil tegengaan dan geeft ze vaak permissie of zelfs opdracht aan de pers om daar zeer kritische verhalen over te schrijven ook kunnen verschillende groeperingen binnen de overheid er baat bij hebben om de interne besluitvorming een bepaalde richting op te duwen dat is denk ik wat er gebeurde met het verhaal van de olieboeren sommige krachten in peking vonden dat de boeren niet onteigend mochten worden en zij hoopten met de verslaggeving de besluitvorming terug te draaien zonder succes overigens een derde reden is dat de staatsgecontroleerde media steeds minder geld krijgen van de overheid dat leidt tot een vaak ongebreidelde commercie het wordt belangrijk om met primeurs te komen die het publiek prikkelen en aantrekken een verhaal over de ontvangst van het ethiopische staatshoofd door de chinese president doet dat doorgaans niet daardoor zijn er veel media die willens en wetens langs de rand schurken van wat nog officieel toelaatbaar is dat levert vaak interessante zij het niet altijd betrouwbare journalistiek op de vierde reden is dat journalisten domweg gehecht zijn aan hun vak het is waar veel journalisten raken door het gebrek aan persvrijheid hopeloos gecorrumpeerd ze laten zich betalen voor hun berichtgeving en er circuleren veel verhalen over journalisten die zich in een conflict laten inhuren door n van beide partijen maat er is gelukkig ook een belangrijke groep journalisten die wil berichten wat er in hun land echt aan de hand is zij komen achter misstanden die bij het brede publiek niet bekend zijn opvallend is dat de meeste journalisten tijdens de opstanden op het plein van de hemelse vrede in 1989 de kant van de studenten kozen en massaal opriepen tot een vrije pers en die spelen daar moeten we vooral niet te veel van verwachten het wordt vast niet de grote doorbraak naar democratie en persvrijheid waarop sommigen hopen dat is onze droom misschien maar zeker niet die van de chinese overheid de olympische spelen zijn een groot zeer commercieel sportfestijn dat wij aan china hebben gegund omdat we chinas aanbod niet konden of wilden afwijzen china krijgt daarmee de gelegenheid om zich van zijn goede moderne en machtige kant aan de wereld te tonen het wordt vast een weergaloos festijn aan ons de taak om niet alleen dat feestgedruis hoorbaar en zichtbaar te maken maar om ook de mensen aan het woord te laten die op dat feest niet welkom zijn

4868799 maybe they realise that they no longer are the undisputed champions of the world maybe they feel the crown is slipping

4868860 what is worthy of satire is the misuse of religion for destructive or political gains
4868861 thats totally different from the word the blood the body and the christ his kingdom is not of this earth
4868862 and though i am a committed christian i believe that everyone has the right to their own religion be you hindu jewish or muslim i believe there are infinite paths to accepting jesus christ as your personal savior
4868863 i find it encouraging to see that colbert is truly sincere about christianity
4868864 im glad he doesnt shy from stating hes a christian as hes done many times on his show
4868865 i cannot comprehend that someone as sharp as colbert is a devout christian i am shocked
4868866 i felt that reciting the verse colbert was not being the colbert report character but that his own religion was dictating that he had to say the verse as a demonstration of his own faith and it wasnt right to fool around with that
4868867 i experienced this moment as a startling statement of faith the kind of thing you dont normally see on tv
4868868 i have to walk a thin line because i dont want to criticize anyones religions for the fact that it is a religion and whats funny to me is what people do in the name of religion
4868869 i know we re not a secular state like france which has it in their constitution but boy i wish our founding fathers had been at little clearer in that first amendment
4868870 he created me in his image and i sure love me
4868871 either colbert was flabbergasted at interviewing someone more right wing than his own persona or just wanted to let him hang himself
4868872 if god was into reconciliation he would have said i made a mistake
4868873 evil exists because of the disobedience of satan god gave satan the angels and man free will satan used his free will and abused it by not obeying authority hell was created by satans purposeful disobedience to god and and his purposeful removal from gods love you send yourself to hell god does not send you there

4868875 after hunter died i received hundreds of e mails from young people around the world people felt lost

4868886 to hear hodari speak one wonders if michigan is the third world
4868887 planned parenthood complains about back alley abortions even though hodari is running a business where hes barely washing his hands between abortions
4868888 several women have died while getting abortions with hodari and yet the michigan board of health has never investigated him how many women have to die before the bureaucrats start telling hodari to wash his hands and tell patients the truth

4868910 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4868911 they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
4868912 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system
4868913 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4868914 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4868915 as these additional security measures are taken the units of the russian armed forces that were sent into the zone of the south ossetian conflict will be withdrawn
4868916 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4868917 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4868918 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4868919 part of discovery is finding things that you least expect
4868920 when you come across something like that in the middle of the desert it sends a tingle down your spine

4868923 which suggests he was eating a lot of protein and had an active strenuous lifestyle the kiffian appear to have been fairly healthy it would be difficult to grow a body that tall and muscular without sufficient nutrition
4868924 this mans life was less rigorous perhaps taking smaller fish and game with more advanced hunting technologies
4868925 these remains were found to be of very muscular individuals well over six feet tall
4868926 and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose there were nephilim in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bare children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown
4868927 every item of written and pictorial attestation confirms that the ancient sumerians were absolutely sincere about the existence of the anunnaki and those such as enki enlil nin khursag and inanna fulfilled earthly functions with designated community duties they were patrons and founders they were teachers and justices they were technologists and kingmakers they were jointly and severally venerated as archons and masters but there were certainly not idols of religious worship as the ritualistic gods of subsequent cultures became in fact the word which was eventually translated to become worship was avod which meant quite simply work the anunnaki presence may baffle historians their language may confuse linguists and their advanced techniques may bewilder scientists but to dismiss them is foolish the sumerians have themselves told us precisely who the anunnaki were and neither history nor science can prove otherwise
4868928 jehovah takes his stand at the council of el to deliver judgment among the elohim
4868929 you too are gods sons of el elyon all of you
4868930 behold a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven
4868931 the gods had clasped their hands together had cast lots and had divided anu then went up to heaven to enlil the earth was made subject the seas enclosed as with a loop they had given to enki the prince of earth
4868932 enki was not happy about his brothers promotion because although enlil was the elder of the two his mother ki was anus junior sister whereas enkis mother antu was the senior sister true kingship claimed enki progressed as a matrilineal institution through the female line and by this right of descent enki maintained that he was the first born of the royal succession
4868933 i am the great brother of the gods i am he who has been born as the first son of the divine anu
4868934 the dominant tenet of the new thought was based wholly on the utmost fear of enlil who was known to have instigated the great flood or else acquiesced in not warning the humans or making any attempt to save them and to have facilitated the invasion and destruction of civilized sumer
4868935 abraham had experienced the vengeful enlil first hand at the fall of ur and he was not about to take any chances with his own survival he was even prepared to sacrifice the life of his young son isaac to appease the implacable god genesis 32 9
4868936 the oriental scholar henri frankfort summarized the situation by making the point that those who served jehovah must forego the richness the fulfillment and the consolation of a life which moves in tune with the great rhythms of the earth and sky
4868937 we therefore find ea enki as the reputed culprit who tried to teach early man adam the way to spiritual freedom this suggests that ea intended his creation homo sapiens to be suited for earth labor but at some point he changed his mind about using spiritual enslavement as a means
4868938 this muddled and unparalleled concept of jehovah being right when he was wrong honest when he was dishonest was born out of an inherent fear of his vengeful power and unbounded wrath whether as jehovah in genesis or as enlil in mesopotamian record it was he who had instigated the semitic invasions which led to the confusion of tongues and the fall of sumer it was he who had brought about the devastating flood and it was he who had leveled the cities of sodom and gomorrah not because of their wickedness as related in genesis 18 19 but because of the wisdom and insight of their inhabitants as depicted in the coptic paraphrase of shem it was jehovah who had removed the israelites from their homeland and sending them into seventy years of captivity by king nebuchadnezzar ii and his five babylonian successors down to king belshazzer 545 539 bc
4868939 there was great jubilation in the land when the great temple was rededicated to enlil and ninlil enlils wife in the year 1953 b c e it was only then that the cities of sumer and akkad were officially declared habitable again
4868940 lord anu lord of the gods who from heaven came to earth and enlil lord of heaven and earth who determines the destinies of the land determined for marduk the firstborn of enki the enlil functions over all mankind made him great among the gods who watch and see called babylon by name to be exalted made it supreme in the world and established for marduk in its midst an everlasting kingship
4868941 in his sumerian etymological dictionary and comparative grammar k lm n gosztony professor of sumerian philology at the sorbonne demonstrated that the grammatical structure of the hungarian language is the closest to that of the sumerian language out of the 53 characteristics of sumerian grammar there are 51 matching characteristics in the hungarian language 29 in the turkic languages 24 in the caucasian languages 21 in the uralic languages 5 in the semitic languages and 4 in the indo european languages

4868945 their audience as sentient human beings rather than average consumers there is no compulsion to check off categories up to the minute hipstermism fart jokes for the kids blueish double entendres for the teenagers and adults a barrage of visual and aural cues that keep the action cynically grounded in hip hop mall internet culture none of the relentless calculation that renders the average commercial product animated or live action nothing more than pricey yet expendable box office fodder
4868946 its not that pixar is less concerned with turning a profit
4868947 but that they care about making movies as much as they care about making money
4868948 but michel draws better and the story is really sweet
4868949 both funny and touching michel rabagliatis paul has a summer job has an authenticity sorely lacking in most forms of entertainment not least of all comix exactly like a restorative trip to the woods it reminds you of what you really enjoy literature for the chance to connect to others and whats real and get away from superficiality and irony
4868950 the geniality of paul moves out becomes infectious as rabagliati recreates what its like to be an inexperienced young person learning about art film food music and love he works deliberately toward a quiet but devastating finish which recasts all thats come before as a kind of origin story not for a superhero but for a life
4868951 a warm and funny guy who delivers a goofily compelling hank williams tribute to boot you cant help but like paul hes yet another a man who predictably cites the catcher and the rye as his favorite book but is self deprecating enough to admit that he loves lucie most because shes smarter than he is

4869047 ahhh thaaats why he looked so much like a more feminine version of boy george
4869048 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4869049 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4869050 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4869051 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4869052 we want our activists to have some experience with the art and the tactics of politicking as well
4869053 the best way to assess someones passion compassion and devotion and dedication is through working with someone and the best way is to see how he or she has volunteered on the ground the party mechanism on the ground is an excellent screening and training system to identify people with a heart
4869054 human beings have still not been able to form a human society and have still not learned to move with the spirit of a pilgrim although many small groups motivated by self interest work together in particular situations not even a small fraction of their work is done with a broader social motive by strict definition shall we have to declare that each small family unit is a society in itself if going ahead in mutual adjustment only out of narrow self interest or momentary self seeking is called society then in such a society no provision can be made for the disabled the diseased or the helpless because in most cases nobody can benefit from them in any way in that case there always remains the possibility of some people getting isolated from the collective all human beings must attach themselves to others by the common bond of love and march forward hand in hand then only will i proclaim it a society
4869055 valid under venezuelas constitution as with any tool of democracy it depends how it is used
4869056 you will be more than guaranteed in the hands of the republic and you know the banking sector of venezuela is one of the most solid in the world
4869057 riot police used tear gas as they blocked hundreds of venezuelans protesting what they call new moves by president chavez to concentrate his power
4869058 blacklists barring key opposition candidates from elections and socialist decrees destroying whats left of their democracy
4869059 is acceptable in accordance with the laws that are given for reasons of general interest for the safety of others of society and for the common good in accordance with the provisions of articles 30 and 32 2 of the american convention on human rights this requirement is fully compatible with the provisions of articles 19 and 156 of the national constitution
4869060 objective and accurate information about all trade union social movement and political organisations in venezuela
4869061 support the right of the venezuelan people to determine their own future free from external intervention
4869062 conducted strictly on legal and administrative grounds carried out as part of the constitutional and legal obligations of the office of the comptroller general taken following
4869063 is using his decree powers to enact a set of socialist inspired measures that seem based on a package of constitutional changes
4869064 when the government acts as it has now without respecting the constitution and the word of the president is the law then an act of tyranny is being committed
4869065 formalize socialist inspired policies on the margins of the formal economy like a measure declaring barter a legitimate system of payment
4869066 the coming regional elections have the potential to erode the presidents power base
4869067 to set up neighborhood based militias state control over agriculture
4869068 chavez enact ing aggressive new laws with an iron fist increasing the states power over the economy ahead of key regional elections
4869069 drive to create a socialist state significantly increase his power and resemble proposals included in a constitutional reform narrowly rejected by voters in a december referendum
4869070 up in arms over a raft of decree laws they say replicate constitutional reforms
4869071 typical of mr chavezs authoritarian streak and will let him expropriate private property without the need for the ans approval
4869072 ambitious decrees which formalize the creation of a popular militia and further consolidate state control over key areas of the economy such as agriculture and tourism
4869073 bypass ing congress in making laws and being back on the offensive after suffering a humiliating defeat in december that might have let him stay in power for life
4869074 accusations that mr chavez is evading the will of the people
4869075 we are in the presence of a dictatorial government which has given a coup detat to the constitution here we have no constitution no law and the president does exactly what he wants
4869076 everything hes doing is related to the upcoming election and its hard to imagine he doesnt see this as important in his efforts to keep power
4869077 put ting down all challengers to his power forcibly if necessary
4869078 get in the way of mr chavezs caudillo aspirations at your peril
4869079 the four parties could directly implement the ongoing schedule of the kpu
4869080 until you mentioned it i didnt even think about it it was good to have them both back
4869081 hes real experienced and knows a lot more than a lot of our corners do
4869082 so a lot of us go to luke and ask luke about little things ins and outs of corner what not to do and how to play this and how to play certain routes hes been there to teach us just as well as coach tim lewis
4869083 having luke out there on the field with you is good its just like when mint mike minter was here mint was the one helping me out now i can go to luke since mints not here and luke can help me out on stuff i dont know
4869084 we still have some more things to talk about as far as what we can do to go out there and co exist on the same field the same team and still be productive and help this team win this year
4869085 only two men can do that and i feel like we have what it takes in order to do so
4869086 well be better off this week than we were a week ago
4869087 in every generation there is a chosen one one girl in all the world one born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires
4869088 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4869089 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4869090 in every generation there is a chosen one one girl in all the world one born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires
4869091 we think the pleasant state that can be induced by music leads to special physiological changes which eventually lead to stress reduction or direct immune enhancement
4869092 stress reduction probably plays an important role but the stress reducing effect seems to be different for various types of music
4869093 wed expect that different kinds of music might show different physiological and immunological effects
4869094 listening to music in hospitals might show benefits for patients and may for example lead to shorter recovery times but we are still to test this ourselves
4869095 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
4869096 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
4869097 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
4869098 democrats should take a deep breath and realize that there are a group of voters who wont make up their mind about a candidate until deep in the fall
4869099 and there are 18 states that are battlegrounds for a reason and theyll be decided by 2 to 4 points i dont care about national polls
4869100 i think senator obama is a motivational speaker but at the end of the day i dont think that will translate into votes and certainly not the image of strength that ronald reagan had
4869101 the one area he still needs credibility in is experience and picking an evan bayh or a joe biden as vice president would help a lot with that
4869102 it wouldnt be bad if he came out early and said who his secretary of defense and secretary of state would be that would address and stabilize the concerns about his experience
4869103 in rural parts of georgia and the south there is still some fear about people who look different from themselves
4869104 and theres also healing left to do among women who wanted to see the day that a woman was elected president
4869105 you can put slime in the covers of a book and its still slime
4869106 this is a public school we dont focus on religion
4869107 in our daily lives we try to respect religion but we dont give preferential treatment
4869108 i came here to barack obamas elementary school in jakarta looking for what some are calling an islamic madrassa like the ones that teach hate and violence in pakistan and afghanistan
4869109 ive been to those madrassas in pakistan this school is nothing like that
4869110 there is a lot of christians buddhists also confucian so thats a mixed school
4869111 the truth is that we do not know for sure how many moves there were or where obama was living when he attended the government run public school unfortunately what obama writes about his time in indonesia is not precise enough with regard to locations and dates to help us to sort it out obama was young when he was in indonesia and maybe some of the details of the experience are obscure even to him or maybe he is trying to minimize intentionally the extent to which the experience placed him in an islamic setting where he received public school education in islam again we simply dont know

4869118 dr corsi presents his material in straight forward fashion media matters spokesman only wants to discredit the author it seems that larry and mr waldman wanted to stay away from the actual content of the book larry appeared to side with mr waldman which was curious for a news host posted by william august 16 2008 12 37 pm
4869119 the basic fact is that obama does not have a fundamentally american background the book outlines that posted by jay carlson august 16 2008 12 14 pm
4869120 i read the book when i first heard about it corsi has over 300 footnotes showing that he has researched everything that he says i dont understand people at all how people can vote for a man who they know nothing about who has no international or even national experience he is just a few years short of handing out pamphlets on the southside wake up everyone and find out something about this man hes friends with ayers rezko known anti white anti semites farrakhan khalidi if you think the book is all lies what about these people everyone knows bo associated with them its a known fact we cant afford to have an unknown quanity in the whitehouse we need someone to dig us out of the slime were in now and more slime will just drag us down into the sewer posted by suze august 16 2008 3 21 pm
4869121 one of the reasons i wrote this book is to keep obama from getting elected
4869122 the problem is that the stories he told about jfk and about selma to make the connections are fabrications they are lies with no basis in fact or reality
4869123 if obama will lie about his parents what wont he lie about
4869124 all i can say is he loved everybody he was here to share that love
4869125 i was once told god needs his angels too and god is too wise to make mistakes
4869126 you didnt need to reward him for him to reward you
4869127 im so happy i actually had a chance to have him in my life
4869128 now its time for change to come about in our lives
4869129 see we are having the up and down vote you wanted because we want drilling also
4869130 pelosi said the legislation would require oil companies to pay billions of dollars in drilling royalties making drilling economically unfeasible which would be invested in clean energy resources
4869131 democrats also want to release supplies from the u s emergency oil stockpile to help lower gasoline prices
4869132 once again without regard to whether it makes any financial sense
4869133 in addition pelosi said the legislation would seek to rein in excessive energy market speculation that many u s lawmakers blame without any logical or empirical support for running up crude oil and gasoline prices
4869134 produce an influx of tax revenue from additional lease sales and royalties as well as from income and excise taxes
4869135 id bet its an election ploy itll get voted down and shell blame the republicans
4869136 whats obviously going on here is that her party is getting hammered in their home districts and she needs to give them some cover at least for the next few weeks until she has to get specific
4869137 wonder if the pres has the nerve to veto any bill with a moratorium extension i hope he does because that would be a big winner come election day
4869138 unfortunately it isnt up to us directly its really up to mccain
4869139 i will veto ay appropriations with any drilling ban extentions
4869140 all of this only adds to the urgency of producing more of our own energy including americas enormous oil reserves that lie offshore we need to drill here and drill now so that our energy supplies and the strength of our economy do not depend on the decisions or dictates of foreign powers
4869141 the democrat bill which pretends to offer off shore drilling but has all sorts of strings attached that will make it so costly for oil exploration that no one but the chinese oil companies will touch it bill fubar 666
4869142 democrats also want to release supplies from the u s emergency oil stockpile to help lower gasoline prices
4869143 if you look at folks of color even women theyre more successful in the democratic party than they are in the white uh excuse me in the republican party because we just give more opportunity to folks who are hardworking people who are immigrants and come from members of minority groups
4869144 you can put slime in the covers of a book and its still slime

4869167 oh jadi ia ingat kemarin saya meminta maaf dengan cara seperti ini dan sekarang ia meminta maaf karena telah membuat saya jengkel sejak pagi sampai sore
4869168 this is nothing new top russian officials including prime minister and former president putin have been saying precisely this for more than a year now dont they listen dont they realize that bluffing of this type gets you in serious trouble
4869169 by deploying poland is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4869170 now if the abm systems are actually deployed to poland larouche explained
4869171 stop this childish bluffing this can get people killed war is not a game didnt the past weeks events in south ossetia teach them anything dont they see that bluffing is dangerous
4869172 the british misjudged the russians and they said oops and backed off
4869173 nobody in the u s government has had the sense to acknowledge the mistake
4869174 asked what he might do to retaliate for the abm deployment in central europe he said he would return to the cold war practice of having russian ballistic missiles programmed to strike targets in europe in this case he said the czech and polish antimissile sites as well as new u
4869175 it is obvious that if part of the strategic nuclear potential of the united states is located in europe and according to our military experts will be threatening us we will have to respond

4869188 i remember a few times seeing bush cheney stickers a few years back at shows and thinking that was a bit weird
4869189 while facebook made all the media noise last year bebo was in some ways more innovative
4869190 bebo has an incredibly strong brand identity particularly with the teenage and young adult market so it will be very interesting to see how aol makes best use of their new youthful trojan horse
4869191 microsoft did it with facebook news corp did it with myspace so bebo was the next logical target
4869192 our creators are very enthusiastic about touch you can play games with your hands your finger or your pencil it is going to bring a completely new experience
4869193 but you have to remember the context of playing mobile games we are not seeking a similar gaming experience with dedicated gaming handhelds
4869194 we are targeting the 21st century audience this audience is expecting to have a top quality gaming experience on their phones just like on their console at home
4869195 this is the first omni directional platform that allows near natural walking
4869196 we are using virtual reality to study human behaviour we want to learn how different sensory signals are used by the human brain to generate representation or layout of a location
4869197 pompeii is a great showcase because it lets you discover a city that no longer exists
4869198 over time attackers have figured out better and more interesting things to do with cross site scripting
4869199 the awareness is not there that if you write code you need to test it before you put it out there
4869200 its such a target rich environment i do not think the attackers need to have a very sophisticated way to harvest sites for vulnerabilities
4869201 any definitive agreement between yahoo and google would consolidate over 90 of the search advertising market in googles hands this would make the market far less competitive
4869202 yahoos moves are proof positive that it is standing with the back againts the firewall
4869203 it looked like microsoft had all the cards yahoo is at least now able to use this for leverage to get microsoft to pay more
4869204 the combination of these factors results in a high volume of new malicious code samples that threaten users online
4869205 part of the rise was down to criminals increasingly using trojans as a beachhead to gain access to a pc and then use that route to download and install a variety of other malicious programs
4869206 almost two thirds of all malicious code threats currently detected were created during 2007
4869207 thats one of the things that was very very important to my partners and i seeing as how we were very dedicated to our artists and our brand here was a place that would be a great new home for our artists we felt very confident with that and also that the rendezvous brand which does stand for something will continue in the future as well so those are two parameters that were met making this feel good for all of us i dont think its a surprise to anyone to know that the music business over the last couple of years has changed so dramatically making it virtually impossible for a young completely independent company to thrive

4869209 bread for the world offering of letters and a meeting with mr beckmann to discuss how holy trinity parish can help bread further its agenda in 2008 bread will be pushing for more and better poverty focused development assistance funding in the u s budget for programs that give people in poor countries the skills and opportunities to break the cycle of poverty permanently such as agricultural development nutrition clean water health care and primary education especially for girls and women in addition we hope to educate ourselves and others about how we each can reduce our carbon footprint many of us see this as a social justice and stewardship of gods gifts issue as follows almighty god in giving us dominion over things on earth you made us fellow workers in your creation give us wisdom and reverence so to use the resources of nature that no one may suffer from our abuse of them and that generations yet to come may continue to praise you for your bounty through jesus christ our lord amen
4869210 hands on projects that the children and maybe their parents can become involved in to reduce their carbon footprints
4869211 well i dont know a lot about john mccains family history i do know however that as recently as last week i think it was the senator made a comment in south dakota regarding his wife entering some buffalo chips contest which is this topless deal and if she were to enter she would probably win it and my personal opinion and based on my understanding of the christian faith thats not not n o t not the type of expression that a presidential candidate or anyone for that matter who is a follower of the christian faith ought to make
4869212 i dont know if that is a perfect case in point but it surely does help to juxtapose the dna of senator obama if you would versus the dna of senator mccain
4869213 and as recently as yesterday i think it is our pastor from saddleback rick warren indicated that he would not feel comfortable voting for an adulterer and i dont know exactly to whom he was referring but i think the data speaks for itself and again at the end of the day and i really appreciate you raising this because at the end of the day again i think the american public deserves full revelation of the candidates character and competency character and competency so whatever questions that should be asked that would give the voting public an indication as to who they are and what theyve done should be fair game

4869220 identity thieves will take your credit card and swipe it through this device and this device pulls all the information off the magnetic stripe
4869221 then by virtue of that theyre able to take this device connect it to a computer and upload that information onto the computer itself
4869222 it kind of makes you more hesitant about who you give your card to and what theyre actually going to use it for
4869223 it makes you want to look at your receipt more carefully
4869224 this worries me cause i see it every day i guard my paperwork better and look at it better and more often
4869225 my biggest tip to anyone is obviously when you get your credit or debit card statement give it the appropriate attention i mean weve all got a bad habit of taking a credit card statement signing off on it and paying it without really giving it the appropriate attention it deserves
4869226 if youre going to pull up to a pump and use your credit card to pay for your gas take a good look at the device youre putting your credit card into
4869227 it kind of makes you wonder what other means they have to secure your finances
4869228 and with rising gas prices and the economy going into the depression were in a little bit it makes you wonder where your moneys at

4869240 ive been running very hard and have used some of my emotions and aggressions in my workouts said andrews who grappled with weight problems earlier in his career
4869241 im feeling pretty strong i just want to keep reassuring myself that i have the means and the mind set to keep the weight off
4869242 you could tell that hes been working and looks strong and hes worked out just about every day since hes been back here the coach said
4869243 a few weeks ago was the first time i ever opened up to anybody about anything he said
4869244 its been tough im still going through a lot but im just trying to make it its been a big step for me
4869245 i wanted to let them know that i hope they still respect me and if they dont im going to do everything possible to gain their respect back he said you must fill out the comment body in order to submit a comment
4869246 perhaps the most critical issue facing public education in a generation
4869247 if its a poor choice you spend the next 60 days worrying about the other plane
4869248 i am going upstairs to lie with kenzie i cant stand watching him manipulate you like that
4869249 in my rl i love found objects bits of glass beads twists of metal
4869250 on mondays i needed something to help me cope and that is where cat came in handy
4869251 it gave me that alertness to do my work i used drugs every day i couldnt get out of bed or face people without them
4869252 i moved to london to start afresh but within three days i was back on drugs
4869253 that caused a lot of pain for my family and i felt like a loser on my return to sa i started making my own drugs with recipes on the internet
4869254 i was isolated i had no friends i lived alone in a flat without a carpet or mattress but i had my cat all that mattered to me
4869255 i started smoking dagga at 17 and at 30 i turned to alcohol
4869256 it is vital to establish substance abuse prevention programmes at school level as substance abuse is a rapidly growing problem among the youth
4869257 it has almost become fashionable to get into rehab but it is also setting a dangerous precedent even though it helped to put drug addiction into the public forum
4869258 substance abuse is on the increase as more and harder drugs are becoming easily available
4869259 we are seeing profound improvement in the quality of life for all our patients but it is still a huge task
4869260 people graduate from being alcohol users to becoming multi drug users and they progress to even harder drugs
4869261 we see addiction as an illness it is chronic progressive and it can be fatal that is why we have employed former addicts to counsel addicts at the centre
4869262 we can make more money on mobile than we do on the desktop eventually
4869263 oooiii kmu ga mungkin bisa lah kita ini cuma katak mana mungkin bisa mendaki gunung 1000 kaki
4869264 oooiii jangan buang waktu lah kita nih cuma katak mana mungkin bisa belum tentu juga box itu adalah box ajaib
4869265 benar juga yah belum tentu box ini bisa mengabulkan permintaan saya lagian saya kan cuma katak
4869266 oooiii kmu ga akan bisa kita ini cuma katak belum tentu juga itu ada box ajaibnya
4869267 the reason this scandal was as devastating as it was was there wasnt transparency in the beginning not because they were coddling criminals although that was the impact
4869268 the church with all its wonderful qualities one of its not so wonderful qualities is its adherence to secrecy which has certainly contributed to the problem
4869269 i think in the studies that i read after 2002 i came to that conclusion for the first time
4869270 all those formed in my mind the conviction that the recidivism rate was too great to ever chance allowing someone to recommit this crime
4869271 this is something that i have to live with because its a terrible crime and it was on my watch
4869272 because communications technologies are comparatively speaking dematerialized a reversal in material trade patterns almost certainly would not also mean a reversal in intellectual trade patterns rising oil prices or climate change wont shut down the web or stop bollywood from making movies or prevent innovators from licensing their ideas in other countries in fact it might be that expertise innovation and culture will flow more freely in a world where goods flow more slowly we might actually grow more interconnected in a world where supply chains shrank
4869273 transportation costs are not the only reasons why globalization as we know it might be in for some rapid evolution consider
4869274 im making a lot more putts than i did the first day
4869275 all i can do is play the best i can and try to shoot a low score ill focus on being consistent hitting
4869276 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4869277 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4869278 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4869279 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4869280 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4869281 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4869282 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4869283 im going for an injection on monday the tendonitis has come back again
4869284 im going down to london to see a specialist about the tendon itll be up and down in the day im not sure what type of injection itll be but its different to my last one
4869285 its disappointing but all im thinking about just now is getting fit again
4869286 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here but if something were to happen id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is okay because we were able to protect them
4869287 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started
4869288 why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves
4869289 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorisation of the institution
4869290 one accident and i dont know how the school board would live with themselves individual school boards should not the type of power to be able to do this
4869291 this is a disaster waiting to happen it is right up there with the worst ideas in the history of modern education
4869292 we could end up arming half the gangs in houston
4869293 this is the type of decision that makes texas a laughing stock both nationally and internationally
4869294 it is foolish to introduce more weapons into the school environment
4869295 in the event of a crisis there is no manageable way to integrate armed staff into the crisis response plan
4869296 gun control extremists may despise it but this is a common sense approach to the potential of school violence
4869297 thankfully in this country we see guns as a dangerous problem and not as a solution
4869298 gerhartsreiter is at the centre of the longest con ive ever seen in my professional career
4869299 as prosecutors we need more than a photo and a fading memory to walk into court and amend a complaint
4869300 i dearly wanted to see you and my sons i never gave up hopes that if i lived long one day i would be able to see you again
4869301 but he quickly recovered his language skill we had private time just between the two of us
4869302 my husband said he was sorry for leaving everything to me and thanked me for raising the two children
4869303 he said it was his great honour in his life to meet me
4869304 you are always looking to win games and weve had two games against top sides in europe that were great experiences and great preparation especially playing in the czech republic for the macedonia game the temperatures could be similar to what we encountered in june
4869305 but the northern ireland game is one where were looking for a good performance but for a good win as well it is our last game before the serious stuff and the result really counts expectations are there and weve got to try and live up to them if we perform as we can then we can get a good win but thats always the challenge in football giving people the things they expect
4869306 ive spoken to everton coach davie moyes and birmingham and ex scotland manager alex mcleish about him and he is the kind of player who can unlock defences with his abundance of talent
4869307 he does the unusual is capable of scoring goals its just about getting him to work in a system that suits the team touch wood well get him in the squad this time
4869308 you can adjust systems they are never black and white weve midfielders who can play different roles but i want him high up the pitch creating stuff i dont want him back in our own penalty box so you have to have a system where he has a role an attacking role that will fit with how we are going to play
4869309 the way well play on wednesday wont be a million miles from what we will do in macedonia
4869310 you are at home at hampden where you want to be attacking but i just felt after two games we need to be more positive in possession i want us to have that belief when we have the ball and want us to be more positive going forward from there international football is tough but you must have that belief
4869311 we are a friend of all people in the world even israelis and americans
4869312 we do not recognise a country called israel and so we cannot recognise a nation called israel
4869313 if mr mashai does not have the political awareness that the israeli people are the same people who have occupied the homes of millions of innocent and oppressed palestinians and have created the army of the zionist regime he has no right to hold such a position
4869314 the university of oxford has no record of ali kordan receiving an honorary doctorate or any other degree from the university
4869315 if he fails to decide to quit within the next two days the impeachment process will take its course
4869316 president musharraf is confident about defending himself in the parliament and defeating the charge sheet easily because whatever he did he did in the interest of the country and for the nation
4869317 this should be clear to everyone as impeachment is a constitutional affair and that could only be done through the parliament
4869318 it is a market i have had good experiences with in the past and one ive found comfortable dealing in
4869319 i had alan maybury and steve kirk at hearts and both did a good job for me and it was the same when i had paddy mccarthy at leicester
4869320 players from over there are serious about the game and all seem to have a good attitude and are hungry to learn and improve but you have to consider that we have a couple of loan deals if we were looking to buy warren feeney he would cost 750 000 and we couldnt afford that i do think there is some value to be had from that market though
4869321 since our clubs went full time players moving between ireland and scotland wont be asked to make such a great step up so that makes them more attractive to spl teams
4869322 we have a bit to go but the improvement in quality is shown by the fact that in their uefa cup qualifier the other night st pats could draw 2 2 away to elfsborg it was only last month the swedes beat hibs home and away in the intertoto
4869323 our clubs have been paying salaries that are too high for crowds they attract and as the market adjusts to the levels required more good young irish talents could become decent value to scottish clubs
4869324 we are now in peace time why should we be blowing up bridges when our job is to restore
4869325 if any party is greedy we have agreed that mr mugabe will be president whilst i become prime minister
4869326 we envisage that the prime minister must chair the cabinet and be responsible for the formulation execution and administration of government business including appointing and dismissing his ministers a prime minister cannot be given responsibility without authority and be expected to deliver
4869327 shall be commander in chief of the defence forces of zimbabwe
4869328 the outside world continues to watch developments in zimbabwe closely and with concern not least given the deteriorating humanitarian situation
4869329 to help put zimbabwe on the right road to its recovery
4869330 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps
4869331 its rare for a whole team of sierra leoneans to go abroad and come back
4869332 it goes to show what sierra leone can do when it puts its mind to it we have managed to stick a feather in the cap for the country
4869333 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
4869334 until now our ability to represent the high latitude oceans and sea ice in oceanographic and climate models has suffered as a result
4869335 it picked him up so to speak and the car was left back at the crossing
4869336 i guess you could say he had an angel looking out for him
4869337 it is very difficult to say when this is going to stop
4869338 there is less material being emitted but the volcano could reactivate at any moment
4869339 there are 43 indictees out of 45 that are already sent to the hague
4869340 make sure that general mladic and hadzic are found and given a chance to defend themselves
4869341 i hope and i will suggest that sooner rather than later we are going to be able to announce that this chapter is closed and that there are no more indictees
4869342 one of the least reported and most scandalous features of the khartoum regimes domestic policies
4869343 national wealth and power to further enrich itself and its cronies while the marginalised regions of the country suffer from terrible poverty
4869344 it does have the potential to be the breadbasket of africa
4869345 smallholder food production goes down commercial food production goes up and food relief serves as a subsidy to this transformation keeping the displaced alive
4869346 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
4869347 she tried to put the water hose on it to do what we could do but by that time it was too late
4869348 it was too much fire the water hose wouldnt do nothing
4869349 you could hear them screaming but there was nothing you could do
4869350 in the same area on the first floor at the rear
4869351 but the bodies did appear to have some severe burns
4869352 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god but i do not obviously try to impose my views on others
4869353 i have had my picture taken more this week than in the rest of my career
4869354 there were so many people there and i thought about what they expect i dont want to disappoint them and want to give them everything they are looking for but i am a very young person and the fact i am coming from barcelona doesnt change that i still have lots to learn and putting pressure on me isnt going to solve that and isnt going to help me
4869355 where you knew every one of the 3 000 people and would play football all the time among the fields
4869356 if my parents didnt get along well it was for the best they parted
4869357 barca didnt give me an option then and said i was still part of the team
4869358 it was much more difficult to go to france on my own after seven years with the one club but that experience set me up for coming to scotland
4869359 i am open minded and dont expect to have problems making friends or being comfortable in the apartment i will rent in bearsden the football will determine how everything else settles down
4869360 the rhythm and pace of training sessions is faster than spain but not france so im not finding any problems
4869361 here it is more physical but my game is about being organised and finding passes i come from the barca school and those are the ways i have to show but i have to adapt my own characteristics
4869362 it is an advantage there so many players competing for places because the level will be much higher and i want to develop as best i can
4869363 we all start from zero so we need to show what we have but im only five days here so it wouldnt be smart to think im going to walk in to a first team position that doesnt mean after a few weeks i cant be making a push though
4869364 the last thing i am thinking about is going back to barca
4869365 i have a four year contract and that means more than any clauses in my deal barca tend to put in buy backs it is standard i left barca thats it
4869366 ah but maybe when i score a goal people will invite me into their home to have this pizza fritter delicacy as it seems described by the interpreter
4869367 i have never made but one prayer to god a very short one o lord make my enemies ridiculous and god granted it
4869368 politically it was just off base with the whole feeling over here at manhunt
4869369 boy was i embarrassed when i found out he gave 2 300
4869370 he said if john is too good for my money ill give it to presumptive democratic nominee barack obama
4869371 there are no sacred cows and marell booker is playing well
4869372 hes at the top right now and he ran with the ones and with some of the young guys being out we didnt want bobby rainey taking all the snaps with the younger offense so we put tyrell in there some
4869373 were just rotating those guys quite a bit and seeing whos going to step up and give us the best chance to win

4869375 from its extraction through sale use and disposal all the stuff in our lives affects communities at home and abroad yet most of this is hidden from view the story of stuff is a 20 minute fast paced fact filled look at the underside of our production and consumption patterns the story of stuff exposes the connections between a huge number of environmental and social issues and calls us together to create a more sustainable and just world itll teach you something itll make you laugh and it just may change the way you look at all the stuff in your life forever
4869376 im really going to do this im ready but im so skeeerred
4869377 just do it no holding back cut once you start i cant stop so go
4869378 you have done nothing but talk about your fucking hair for a week now and im so sick of it that i could jam dull pencils in my own ears just to make it stop so yes i fucking like anything you do to it just do it and shut up

4869382 the most powerful determinant of a webpages importance is the number of incoming referral links which is regarded as a gauge of the sites popularity
4869383 unethical methods known as black hat seo including renting links from popular or long established sites their links carry more weight some unscrupulous seo outfits even exploit loopholes in website managements tools to place hidden links on prestigious sites such as those maintained by universities
4869384 allowing broadband carriers to reserve huge amounts of bandwidth for their own services will not give consumers the broadband internet our country and economy need
4869385 promoting an open and accessible internet is critical for consumers it is also critical to our nations competitiveness in places like japan korea singapore and the united kingdom higher bandwidth and neutral broadband platforms are unleashing waves of innovation that threaten to leave the u s further and further behind

4869391 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
4869392 barack obama remains opposed to new offshore drilling although he now says he would accept a highly restricted version as part of a comprehensive package just recently he claimed that if only americans would inflate their tires properly and get regular tune ups we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling this is bizarre by any reasonable calculation of annual tire inflation and tune up savings the outer continental shelf holds nearly a hundred times as much oil as for oil shale also under federal moratorium after a thousand years of driving with obama inflated tires and obama tuned engines we would still have saved only one fifth the oil shale available in the united states

4869397 it did very well at film festivals but we have no distribution
4869398 i am trying to get it seen by more than two people and a dog i think it is very hard to work at the level we work at making these independent films and not to have recognition
4869399 i think people do want to see films but it is tough
4869400 one time in this town in one day pirates of the caribbean was played 52 times a small independent movie played up against that doesnt have a chance
4869401 it is these little festivals that reignite everything what is lacking is cinema going as a community activity we are too busy flogging it making the bucks as opposed to thinking about what the thing is
4869402 the edinburgh international film festival is the chicken the ballerina ballroom cinema of dreams is the egg

4869409 we had no way we could find out whether the potential bidders had the funds or funding for a proposed purchase
4869410 as there were over 500 e mails from various people this week this has been a very tiresome process for one
4869411 but one has taken advice from various legal sources and it is expected that a re listing of all items for sale in lots will be offered from next week as there has been so much interest
4869412 however next time bidders will be required to have solicitors from the uk to confirm they have funding arrangements in place

4869416 the moment guruji made public his intention to withdraw support to the upa government both at the centre and in the state the independent ministers started contacting him to get a feel of things a couple of them have also bargained regarding ministrial posts in case guruji takes over as cm
4869417 the independent ministers dont want an early election when they came to know of gurujis plan to meet the governor and his threat to withdraw support to the koda government all of them started contacting him through different sources
4869418 strano che la tua intelligenza non ti faccia arrivare a concludere che chi dissidente si mette contro o in opposizione perci la bibbia parla chiaro di questi quanto dice in romani 16 17 18 or io vi esorto fratelli a guardarvi da quelli che fomentano le divisioni e gli scandali contro la dottrina che avete appreso e ritiratevi da loro costoro infatti non servono il nostro signore ges cristo ma il proprio ventre e con dolce e lusinghevole parlare seducono i cuori dei semplici

4869437 weve been so close before it feels good to put a ford here in victory lane
4869438 we always enjoy racing here in front of the home crowd
4869439 its a race track that suits our cars and our driving style
4869440 its not like i wont ever get to see those guys the no 20 crew again but i know its the last time im going to drive that car for those guys

4869442 on old tires when handling was more important we could run the top of the track and keep our engine wound up

4869448 our hypothesis is that flowers are exploiting an emotional niche they make us happy
4869449 because they are a source of pleasure a positive emotion inducer we take care of them in that sense theyre like dogs they are the pets of the plant world
4869450 flowers have been ignored for the most part in the literature on plants and people
4869451 perhaps they have been overlooked because their nature and beauty is so obvious it is hard to imagine that we might have been responsible at least in part for their appearance with the proposed model of evolution and adaptation to a human emotional niche perhaps we have a clearer picture of our floral companions
4869452 but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every mans conscience in the sight of god

4869480 disable turn off post revisions and increase post autosave interval in wordpress 2 6
4869481 on reading the feature list that was expected but i do not agree with the masses here are my thoughts
4869482 as of to date we already have 19 entries for the open class 20 for class a 15 for class b for cars between 1601cc to 1900cc and 20 from cars below 1600cc in class c we should be having more than the permitted 77 cars when comes qualifying on august 29
4869483 if we go by experience and the overwhelming response to the event this year the number of entries for 2008 should exceed last years total of 103 we have a lot of new entries this year and a lot of interest from the international teams
4869484 the list is very impressive theres a host of porsche rsr and lotus machines we will also see the return of the petronas syntium team which narrowly lost the race last year after leading up to the 11th hour the honda malaysia racing team should be favourite again for class a the battle in class b and class c on the other hand have always been close and thrilling we should be seeing a great race this year

4869489 abhinav bindra wins 2008 beijing olympics gold in mens 10m air rifle
4869490 i had a good friend call who has watched us play and he said boy your team has some swagger
4869491 it made me feel good i got choked up when he told me that thats what you want your team has a little swagger i didnt bring it up he just noticed it by watching our games
4869492 we still have 40 games to go and theres a lot of work to be done
4869493 i thought when we were on the houston arizona trip july 18 23 we were starting to show the strains of no soriano in our lineup
4869494 we needed to get alfonso back in the lineup and it came at the right time for us
4869495 its so much easier just writing his name in the lineup in the one hole and then working your lineup after three and four as opposed to worrying about a leadoff hitter and that affects who your second hitter is and who your fifth hitter is
4869496 this kid here hes a game changer when hes on
4869497 thats where he likes thats where he feels comfortable thats where he performs you put him somewhere else and youre not going to get the same performance
4869498 our lineup offensively is reliant on one through eight we have to perform
4869499 im not talking about the seventh and eighth hitters have to do what the three and four hitters have to do we have to get some contributions throughout fukudome for instance is such a good defensive player that he saves us runs in the outfield i try to put him where we can protect him as much as we possibly can
4869500 what weve been trying to do with jason knowing that hes struggled in august and september is were spacing him out a little more
4869501 i hope he appreciates it i think its having a positive effect as opposed to just pitching him every five days from last years experience were trying to tailor it a little more so he gets more time in between starts
4869502 bobbys one of my favorites here hes just a solid young man hes a no excuse guy and goes after it wed like to have him get a nice finish weve got a good bunch of kids and they get along well and theres good chemistry
4869503 nobody expected to be swept im not saying we felt we were a world series team or anything but we didnt think our season would end three games into the playoffs
4869504 we have some unfinished business theyve been getting after it give them all the credit in the world theres 40 games to go thats 25 percent of the schedule in front of us and we play 28 of our 40 games with teams above 500 records and both home and road we have to play
4869505 theyve been doing some exercising and walking on the treadmill
4869506 theyve been doing some things for his upper body just to keep his strength up and i know theyll be doing some back stuff im sure just some stretching and strengthening exercises
4869507 i learned a valuable lesson this year that i have to be more cautious with him
4869508 i was pushing the envelope with him because he was playing well
4869509 every day i said well he got two hits yesterday and hes swinging well he got a run hes kind of like the igniter for us you kind of hate to take a guy out like that i kick myself for it a little bit
4869510 i have to wait and see how it feels movement wise its getting better of course its frustrating right now is really important for the team i feel very sorry for the team
4869511 were going to face a few pretty tough left handed pitchers here pretty quickly
4869512 hell be a guy that can help us either catching playing first base possibly third base and playing off the bench
4869513 at least now ive got another guy to swing the bat off the bench
4869514 if we use loretta ive got a legitimate right handed hitter i had a switch hitter blum if loretta was playing i had to use blum from the right side
4869515 my biggest assumption is whoever got the snake got cold feet and brought it back
4869516 i would really like to figure out who did this and why they did this

4869548 they should have wiped out the shareholders nationalized the institutions with legislation that they are to be reconstituted with necessary taxpayer support to make them financially viable as five or 10 individual privately held units

4869559 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4869560 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4869561 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4869562 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4869563 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4869564 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4869565 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4869566 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4869578 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
4869579 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
4869580 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian catastrophe is gathering pace
4869581 the georgian administration has found the use to its arms which they have been purchasing during the recent several years
4869582 the fact that georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened fire on their russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself i think
4869583 now it is clear to us why georgia never accepted russias offer to sign a legally binding document not to use force for the regulation of the south ossetian conflict
4869584 not so long ago before the military actions in south ossetia georgias president saakashvili said that there was no point in such a document because georgia would not use force against its people as he said it just so happens that it is using it
4869585 some of our more skilled players didnt compete very hard
4869586 weve made adjustments in that area without giving up any offence it may be a different type of an offence
4869587 if you look at our team now there are 15 forwards eight or nine defenceman that are legitimate nhl players and theyre not all going to play here
4869588 its a little different mindset where there are vets that have to make our team
4869589 we wanted to make up for our poor second half in monaco
4869590 tonight we showed a great mind set its 11 players who gave it all and who executed the game plan
4869591 we have a few regrets because we had several occasions in the first half to increase the lead
4869592 we were a bit in trouble in the second half we loosened a bit our hold on the midfield and they nantes regained some self confidence
4869593 the english speaking children felt excluded and humiliated fearing they were being ridiculed in a foreign language

4869598 ive heard complaints about appointments that are not seen offices they cant get in doors closing at 2 30
4869599 they didnt believe we were closed and kept asking where can i go

4869620 we chart essentially every game that every draft prospect has played on video and we track just about every category you can imagine
4869621 i work with one of the best teams in the league as far bouncing ideas off people lawrence frank is from that jeff van gundy pat riley school that really values metrics and thinks they are worth their time
4869622 every team is dealing with the same player pool and thanks to the luxury tax and salary cap we have very similar resources
4869623 lawrence frank for instance will actually take us on the court and walk us through a play that way we can really understand what the player we get will be asked to do and we can go and look for somebody who can do that
4869624 we have a system for measuring those kinds of things there are statistical measures there are more than a handful of numerical components where you can compare this or that to past generations and the longer we do this the more years of information in our system the smarter that system gets

4869635 right now we have a confluence of issues facing candidates embryonic stem cell research global warming science and technology education biotechnology and energy policy its just becoming an avalanche

4869645 geographer hans joachim fuchs in the western german city mainz has another idea he wants to harness the power of cold mountain winds so called kabatic winds or streams of cold dense air that flow downhill with windscreens the screens would keep the cool air on top of the glaciers perhaps preserving them for a little while longer fuchs has been proposing this idea for years and this week hes putting it to the test on monday fuchs and 27 students headed to the rhone glacier in switzerland to install a windscreen measuring 15 meters long 50 feet and 3 meters high at an elevation of 2 300 meters 7 545 feet on the leading edge of the glacier hell be measuring the effectiveness of the screen to see if its a viable solution

4869648 it cant possibly be henry if we had to put henry up it would be a wider sign that the labour party was in deep deep trouble if we cant find a youngish candidate it just shows that the cupboard is bare and we cant afford that
4869649 it would look as if we had completely run out of talent if we had to go back to someone who resigned in disgrace seven years ago
4869650 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4869651 but now that president medvedev has reportedly signed the cease fire agreement i assume that russian forces are going to begin to withdraw expeditiously
4869652 i have to assume for now that the word of the president of russia to the presidency of the eu is going to be respected
4869653 via telephone interviews from july 25 29 2008 the sample was 500 women nationwide with 100 additional african american women and 100 additional hispanic women the margin of error for the main sample was plus minus 4 4 at a 95 confidence level in the subgroups the margin of error was higher
4869654 some of that may change actually when they see the convention and see hillary campaigning for obama
4869655 more likely to feel her general aspect and her attitude were at the heart of her loss
4869656 think her participation in the race will help women who want to run for the presidency in the near future
4869657 natural flow from the ministry of the word into prayer
4869658 is not an essential part of the shape of the liturgy
4869659 the seed of true humanity is within you follow it
4869660 which look a lot like the apostles creed were widely used in preparing persons to receive the sacrament of holy baptism
4869661 the nicene creed as the sufficient statement of the christian faith
4869662 like a compass that always points north the nicene creed points us in the right direction the compass is not the destination just as the creed is not god but it would be much easier to get lost as to what is truly essential for reaching the goal of the christian journey without it
4869663 pick and choose what you like and discard the rest
4869664 thats our experience thats our knowledge base and thats what we do on a daily basis
4869665 you may well get the ags from other states saying hey theyve got a good position
4869666 we had been ramping up and we were throwing human resources at our growth and then we hit the wall in late fall
4869667 weve had to pull back this year just for the sake of trying to be smart about expansion
4869668 almost universally business spending is being scaled down to the absolute bare minimum
4869669 a few months ago all those people were talking about a second half recovery if theres a second half recovery its the second half of 09
4869670 you had record high profits but hiring remained very lean throughout this expansion
4869671 an economic slowdown is always going to choke off business investment but this time we could get several quarters of very low spending
4869672 given the current environment it simply does not make economic sense for us to grow our capacity in 2009
4869673 if you want to continue to do business with us in 2009 your rates had better be flat or well find another vendor
4869674 yeah so were trying to figure out what that flag is there
4869675 yep but we think we might have missed something previously
4869676 how do we know what this flag is if we arent from around here oh wait can i use google on my iphone can i phone a friend like they do on who wants to be a millionaire
4869677 ok well were leaving now see you at the end
4869678 the legislature and the governor changed our marriage laws to please the well connected minority and force a social experiment into other states thats very offensive to a majority of the people at least the way the votes have been going

4869732 previously each user would have to log out completely in order for the next one to start their session even when seeing the same patient this could take several minutes to complete
4869733 using fast user switching we can remove this overhead to improve efficiency while making access easier for our staff they can gain secure access to patient information in seconds this was our main reason for choosing imprivata
4869734 by implementing fast user switching and single sign on clinician sessions can be switched more easily allowing a higher level of productivity for users and greater security of patient information
4869735 we are using the nhs cfh smart card as a factor for strong authentication so users will automatically get secure access into all the clinical applications they require including our pas and pacs systems
4869736 our ultimate goal is that our users benefit from the fastest possible access to clinical applications and using imprivata onesign will help us achieve this
4869737 we will be providing clinicians without smart cards with chip and pin style cards so they too have to meet authentication standards
4869738 the first thing wed like to do is to use the technology on proximity devices so a card reader can sense and log a doctor in from a certain distance and they simply have to authenticate themselves when they get to the platform saving considerable time
4869739 the approach that south manchester has taken with the combination of single sign on with fast user switching and strong authentication demonstrates how nhs trusts can improve speed of access and overall efficiency for clinical staff

4869775 their commitment to excellence and to achieving the olympic dream truly makes them great sport ambassadors for canada
4869776 ive always known that a man who doesnt respect parliament could disrespect his own law and could go see the governor general at any moment to call an election

4869817 he is a good receiver he is a good blocker he is a good runner he has some juice to make big plays with his speed
4869818 the good news is we made some big plays on offense today john parker was pretty precise with the ball didnt throw any interceptions didnt turn it over
4869819 we were more consistent we did give up a couple of big plays and thats something we always want to guard against the defense played well in the red area and played well on third down if you play well in the red area and play well on third down and dont give up big plays then all of a sudden you become hard to score on thats something that we continue to improve on i dont think the ones first team defense gave up but one big play but that is one too many thats something that we have to continue to work on

4869868 he just didnt move up for some reason i dont know what to say i can only hold it down off of him for so far we were a long ways from the wall it tore my car up and took me out of what was a top five finish and barely a top 10
4869869 i dont race like that he knows that to be honest with you id like to know how many feet were between him and the wall i dont know what happened if he looked over at me or his spotter shocked him he never used the track up

4869875 and there was one we did about a king and baby jesus

4869879 i had a tantrum about wearing it but then stephen graham who plays the psychotic skinhead combo offered me 20 quid if i walked down the street in it and i did
4869880 he says to me now that thats exactly what he would have been like asking for money
4869881 there was an essence in the script that this was a character that could get away with not having a fight just through being smart by just being streetwise and savvy a bit like shane was what made him stand out from the rest was that every kid that went to the audition was desperate for the role whereas tomo wasnt
4869882 i got excluded for swearing and wrecking the classroom i just never had anything in life really i must have thought ive got nothing in life so theres no point in being good i was a show off
4869883 i love being on set more and more i look forward to it
4869884 somers town was different to this is england because it was my second job with shane i knew how he worked and i was used to being on set it was really good fun and its winning big awards which is good
4869885 its all about freedom and friendship when he wants something done hell tell you and if it doesnt happen hell shout but that hardly ever happens i dont know what it is about him hes good to be around
4869886 on this is england shane took his time that shoot was five or six weeks and most of somers town was improvised it was piotrs first british film so it was really different for him

4869913 we held our own but our goals are way higher than just holding our own
4869914 to keep em out of the end zone is no 1 and we are just trying to get better we have taken small steps at times but we are getting there
4869915 i think you have to kind of look at strengths wayne latu with the ball in his hands i think is very difficult to tackle and had good vision j j di luigi is probably the more complete package i think wayne might have the edge in running the ball but j j is a little bit better when you consider catching iit as well as running with it and then bryan kariya is similar to manase tonga in how we might use him so all three kind of have different roles

4869919 to me vocatum is a place where the name of jesus is highly and consistently exalted and where we find our calling in the shadow of the cross
4869920 at a time when the 10 year interest rate is in the threes at a time when it is clearly lack of demand for products rather than the cost of capital that is inhibiting investment the idea that a return to the tax policies of the 1990s would somehow damage the economy in a substantial way seems to me supported by neither theory nor evidence nor the longer term history

4869965 if we cant even pronounce beijing correctly and consistently how can we ever hope to address deeper cross cultural misunderstandings and conflicts
4869966 what we should learn from history is that preventive war doesnt work the iraq war didnt work and therefore we should abandon notions such as the bush doctrine of preventive war we should return to the just war tradition which sees force as something that is only used as a last resort which sees war as something that is justifiable for defensive purposes
4869967 as the imperial presidency has accrued power surrounding the imperial presidency has come to be this group of institutions called the national security state the cia the joint chiefs of staff the office of the secretary of defense the other intelligence agencies now these have grown since the end of world war two into this mammoth enterprise
4869968 the elements of continuity outweigh the elements of change and its not going to happen because ultimately we the american people refuse to look in that mirror and to see the extent to which the problems that we face really lie within we refuse to live within our means we continue to think that the problems that beset the country are out there beyond our borders and that if we deploy sufficient amount of american power we can fix those problems and therefore things back here will continue as they have for decades
4869969 our foreign policy is not something simply concocted by people in washington d c and imposed on us our foreign policy is something that is concocted in washington d c but it reflects the perceptions of our political elite about what we want we the people want and what we want by and large i mean one could point to many individual exceptions but what we want by and large is we want this continuing flow of very cheap consumer goods
4869970 the most obvious the blindingly obviously question is energy its oil i think historians a hundred years from now will puzzle over how it could be that the united states of america the most powerful nation in the world as far back as the early 1970s came to recognize that dependence on foreign oil was a problem posed a threat comprised our freedom of action
4869971 how every president from richard nixon down to the present one president bush declared were gonna fix this problem none of them did and the reason we are in iraq today is because the persian gulf is at the center of the worlds oil reserves i dont mean that we invaded iraq on behalf of big oil but the persian gulf region would have zero strategic significance were it not for the fact that thats where the oil is
4869972 were headed down a path in which not only will we become increasingly dependent upon foreign oil but we will have opted for a false model of freedom a freedom of materialism a freedom of self indulgence a freedom of collective recklessness
