5520000 we want to make our community healthy which is why we offer free consultations and examinations as well as educational videos for patients to watch during their treaments and exams
5520001 unfortunately that misses the point if you come in every six months for a dental visit you wont reach the level where you have a problem
5520002 you go for manicures for pedicures and to get your hair done having your teeth professionally cleaned is another facet of self care that makes you feel and look your best
5520003 pasti sampeyan sampeyan seringkali mendapat komeng dari saya dengan tertawa te
5520004 every day we see patients who have dental anxieties fears and phobias
5520005 these fears can have a devastating effect since delays in receiving dental care can impact a persons self confidence appearance and well being left untreated dental problems can have far reaching consequences severely affecting patient health
5520006 sedation should be the last resort not the first course of action
5520007 its a quick fix that may address the symptoms of anxiety but not the underlying cause
5520008 dental anxiety is basically the fear of the unknown and can usually be handled by taking the time to familiarize a patient with the office the equipment and the procedures
5520009 dental fear elicits more of a fight or flight response and typically can be stopped by giving patients more control over their experience dental phobia can be harder to overcome but the same desensitization techniques used to treat other phobias also work well with dental phobia
5520010 i started by showing her all of the instruments we would be using and honestly discussing every step of the procedure
5520011 then she went back in the waiting room until her fear subsided she then came back in and allowed me to do an examination and then went back out to the waiting room we repeated the process over the course of several hours but eventually she received treatment that same day with no sedation
5520012 unfortunately many people have had humiliating or negative experiences with other dentists or have picked up on a parents dental anxiety
5520013 uncovering the source of the problem enables us to develop valuable strategies that will lead to successful treatment
5520014 for some people headphones and a soft blanket will do the trick while others might need to touch the instruments
5520015 if we can alleviate the anxiety fear or phobia it will not only improve a persons dental health but their general well being
5520016 i have only met a couple of cooks and truck drivers from the vietnam war most were hunting vietcong snipers in the elephant grass
5520017 last year 188 men graduated from seal training of 35 000 who joined the navy
5520018 i have only met a couple of cooks and truck drivers from the vietnam war most were hunting vietcong snipers in the elephant grass
5520019 claiming medals that havent been earned is a crime but these guys know they can get away with it
5520020 we dont turn in the guy down the street who is wearing the purple heart at the parade
5520021 but if he has a medal of honor hanging on his wall and hes leading the parade and talking at the local school we might go to the fbi
5520022 they really want to be the hero elite and they forget that it takes every member of the military to make a mission successful
5520023 it doesnt matter whether they are the clerk typing in orders or the cook making meals or the guy on the front lines
5520024 they think its a victimless crime and its not they leave a wake of victims
5520025 it would have been nice to have had that money when i needed it to put my kids through college
5520026 after waiting for 10 years my disability was raised from 30 percent to 80 percent
5520027 all too often it gets bounced around and no final decision is made
5520028 with the va having trouble handling disability claims from previous generations of wartime veterans this new generation may be in for a long and bumpy ride
5520029 and unfortunately there are a number of veterans who have died before their claims are finally resolved
5520030 i heard clearly the dissatisfaction with veterans waiting excessive periods of time to have their claims adjudicated
5520031 a veteran should not need a lawyer to figure what benefit is due or to get that benefit
5520032 they told me i had a new right knee and many of the issues involving the knee were now resolved but i had a metal prosthesis in my leg and there were new issues i appealed my reduced disability rating and it took five years to resolve i finally went to rep brian higgins and within a week it was settled in my favor
5520033 were not where we want to be but we are making leaps and strides every day
5520034 at least three to four years but ive gotten used to it
5520035 27 mv were being applied to the sensory end of the nerve at the instant when the impulse was fired down this channel
5520036 dividing specific binding by membrane area yields an average saxitoxin receptor density of 110 sites per square micrometer on the axon membranes of the vagus we now know that the tetrodotoxin saxitoxin receptor is a single site on the na channel so this experiment tells us how many na channels there are in the membrane surface densities of 100 to 400 channels per square micron are typical
5520037 now that we can record from single channels and even purify them chemically and sequence and modify their genes there remains no question of their molecular individuality
5520038 as though the channel were a cluster of pores like a sieve or an aggregate of straws an alternative would be that the pore fluctuates through frequent rearrangements of many constituent parts
5520039 in recent years there has been an explosion of interest in the node of ranvier and the region immediately surrounding it in vertebrate nerve fibers 38 39 this is because the node of ranvier is now recognized as a metabolically highly active zone and it is of course the site at which the voltage gated sodium channels are highly concentrated nodal and paranodal morphology is complex sharply delineated microdomains are recognized both morphologically and biochemically within what amounts to just a few microns of length in either direction from the centre of the node of ranvier 40 ion channels adhesive proteins and proteins with as of yet unrecognized functions assemble at the node and in its vicinity in very precise relationships to one another that we are just beginning to understand
5520040 one time he was choking me so hard i couldnt breath
5520041 so i played dead when he came off of me i just laid there in shock
5520042 currently we are planning on playing the game certainly the circumstances can change
5520043 we will continue to monitor the storm and its progress we will continue to consult with government agencies as well as the angels and the american league
5520044 if the storm continues its current track and the road conditions are safe we will play the game
5520045 well monitor the weather throughout the day if theres going to be a call to postpone it likely would be made in the afternoon
5520046 right now it look like theres a chance were going to be able to stay here and grind it out at the hotel
5520047 im also proud to be here with these three great americans your two senators and a great governor sonny perdue
5520048 probably one of those seminal times since the end of the cold war
5520049 we didnt win the cold war as you well know in a tank battle on the plains of germany
5520050 we convinced everybody in the world to join us in opposition to communism
5520051 i respect his candidacy and i will always have admiration for what he has been able to achieve
5520052 there are very stark differences for the future of our country and i will continue to share them
5520053 instead of listening to georgians john mccain chose to talk with people who have given him thousands of dollars
5520054 has sold his influence with christian conservative voters to the highest bidder
5520055 in every nook and corner and cranny illegal acts were being committed contrary to sharia law
5520056 as a result of this we sent them to supervise the areas where something has happened
5520057 what we require right now is that verification package from north korea before we can go forward with the delisting
5520058 the united states has not kept its promise to remove us from the list of states sponsoring terrorism up until today past the deadline which is crucial to the complete implementation of the agreement
5520059 this is a clear violation of the action for action principle which is the basis for the realization of denuclearization
5520060 one lady brought 17 years of financial records to be shredded
5520061 we love giving this service out we think it is a valuable service
5520062 our office sees a lot of identity theft on the internet
5520063 i say the score suggests that you may or may not have a memory problem
5520064 some level of cognitive impairment that was not previously recognized
5520065 this demonstration study is looking at what if we actually catch these people and manage their care well
5520066 if people are diagnosed earlier in the illness they are less likely to have crisis after crisis after crisis
5520067 there must be evidence that the benefits outweigh any potential harm
5520068 you might say if youre going to tell me i have a disease that has no cure i dont want to know about it right now
5520069 here is a disease that will fundamentally alter your relationship with your family your friends your future
5520070 we arent treating this like its a tragedy or a sad thing were treating it really practically
5520071 this is kind of cool because now we have the attention of some people who really want to help us
5520072 material that would be considered offensive to members of our community
5520073 kind of dark and moody like the work ive been involved in
5520074 cbs asked us whos at the top of your dream list
5520075 without hesitation we said he is a powerful and intense actor with an incredible range

5520077 again it was on holiday i met her and again on the lat night i discovered her feelings and she mine however all i did was hug and kiss her twice once a peck on the lips once long and smoochy but something seemed wrong to her maybe she discovered that she didnt really like me or that it was too late for us to get to know each other i will never know i havent got her address she hasnt got mine and she lives in berkshire
5520078 its a funny thing she was quite pretty and intelligent and i liked her a lot but im not really going to miss her like carla or sarah although i feel nothing for them now
5520079 but lucy and me had a nice relationship she liked my jokes although she didnt like laughing at them
5520080 and i liked her conversations and her stupidness in certain things i think i seem to like intelligent girls who act stupidly
5520081 still on the subject of holidays its amazing i will probably see none of those people i met again
5520082 i wish i was dropping out of a film with brad pitt in it
5520083 i am glad i am in the kitchen with you eating fishfingers and possibly stolen celebration chocolates and drinking red wine

5520090 praised the israel defense forces for its role in training georgian troops and said israel should be proud of its military might in an interview with army radio israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers yakobashvili told army radio in hebrew referring to a private israeli group georgia had hired
5520091 a georgian military plant in which israeli experts are upgrading jet fighters for the georgian military russian fighter jets bombed runways inside the plant located near tbilisi where israeli security firm elbit is in charge of upgrading georgian su 25 jets
5520092 the main purpose of these exercises is to increase the cooperation and partnership between u s and georgian forces
5520093 the georgian move against south ossetia was motivated by political considerations having to do with israel and iran according to nfc georgian president mikheil saakashvili decided to assert control over the breakaway region in order to force israel to reconsider its decision to cut back its support for georgias military
5520094 russian and georgian media reported several days ago that israel decided to stop its support for georgia after moscow made it clear to jerusalem and washington that russia would respond to continued aid for georgia by selling advanced anti aircraft systems to syria and iran
5520095 to a reporters question about jews who have fled the fighting and come to israel he said
5520096 a cop can kill anyone and get away with it
5520097 promote open and transparent marketing choice pricing and purchasing of course materials
5520098 the attack was short sharp and deadly enough to send the georgians fleeing in humiliating panic
5520099 the western media especially cnn is feeding you complete horseshit russia did not invade georgia first
5520100 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe is aimed at the russian federation

5520108 however a number of prison officers have been working too much overtime and this has become an occupational health and safety issue
5520109 the department believes it is important that there is a balance between work and time away from the demands of the job and we want officers to have more quality time at home
5520110 of course prison officers will continue to earn overtime that is part of the 24 hour job of supervising and managing the states 32 correctional centres but excessive overtime will be stamped out

5520237 for nearly a century greenfield laboratories has been an important lilly site currently housing elancos worldwide headquarters and a significant portion of lillys toxicology testing as well as other r amp d support functions
5520238 these actions reflect lillys determination to take the necessary steps to compete in a very challenging marketplace in which our customers are demanding innovative high quality affordable medicines these are difficult but necessary decisions we must make in order to compete successfully as an independent indiana based company
5520239 our longstanding relationship with lilly has delivered innovation in the safety and efficacy testing of new prescription drug candidates and it sets the stage for this landmark agreement through the years we have demonstrated significant success in expediting early development timelines and improving efficiency
5520240 this expanded agreement creates a new strategic paradigm at a time when the pharmaceutical industry needs to challenge traditional thinking in order to improve its r amp d productivity we are confident that this alliance will help create strategic competitive advantages for lilly and allow lilly to strengthen its focus on its core competencies
5520241 we are also very pleased to expand our employee base in central indiana which has a strong life sciences talent pool and has long been a successful home for our global central laboratory and bioanalytical businesses
5520242 in recent years elanco has expanded in both sales and product offerings posting record revenues of nearly 1 billion in 2007 elanco also recently launched the lilly companion animal health division and acquired ivy animal health
5520243 as weve grown however the current configuration of greenfield laboratories no longer supports elancos needs the new elanco headquarters will centralize the divisions operations while offering significant savings in annual operating expenses
5520244 what we call years yz the period beginning in late 2011 when patents for several medicines begin to expire requires a thorough transformation of our company that includes reduced cycle times and lower r amp d costs
5520245 as we act decisively we aim to implement these changes with utmost respect for our employees and continued support for the communities in which lilly operates
5520246 nowhere is lillys network strategy more pronounced than in indiana where more than 3 000 firms support the companys work in both national and global markets
5520247 through this collaboration with covance and others lilly will help enhance the regions life sciences sector expanding lillys economic footprint in indiana as never before specifically these partnerships will result in no net job reductions in the state and they will offer the potential for new jobs in the future throughout this process we have worked to put lilly employees and indiana first

5520458 every time i plan ahead it bites me in the a
5520459 yesterday president bush made his fifth visit to the area that received the most damage from hurricane katrina in other words the white house
5520460 the president said much of the aid is going towards job training
5520461 its interesting some analysts said the most striking thing about president bushs speech last night was the fact that he didnt name someone to be in charge of the reconstruction see if bush was smart put clinton in charge think about it i mean if you want women flashing their breasts by mardi gras clinton is the guy to do it
5520462 no word yet on mr browns future plans though sources say he does want to spend more time doing nothing for his family
5520463 brown said he was stepping down because he was an ineffective leader who had lost the confidence of the people to which bush said thats no reason to quit your job
5520464 a lot of people are now blaming president bush for not evacuating new orleans sooner hey were still trying to get him to evacuate crawford texas took him five weeks to get out of there
5520465 today president bush asked if his visit to the hurricane zone would count toward the service time he still owes the national guard
5520466 many americans are calling on president bush to fire the head of fema michael brown because of the slow response to the crisis unforuantely due to the red tape firing brown will take 6 to 8 months
5520467 president bush sent vice president dick cheney to new orleans is that what they need down there another person requiring emergency medical help
5520468 our president isnt exactly getting high marks for his handling of the catastrophe people dont seem to realize yes the hurricane has been devastating to the people who live in that area but it has also ruined the last three days of his vacation he has suffered too
5520469 congress announced a plan to rename the gulf of mexico they want to call it persian gulf 2 in hopes that president bush would send troops there faster
5520470 how many folks have been watching the mini series on hbo called rome amazingly exciting episode this week rome is burning while nero refuses to cut his vacation short and dont miss next weeks episode when fema shows up a week late at pompeii
5520471 although the waters have receded from new orleans its still a huge huge problem and will be for months to come you see the fresh water is contaminated with oil and gas actually from dick cheneys perspective the oil and gas is contaminated with fresh water
5520472 as you know fema stands for fix everything my ass
5520473 even president bush almost a week later president bush said his administrations response to katrina was unacceptable
5520474 celine dion criticized president bush for the slow evacuation of new orleans
5520475 i could have driven everyone out of that city in two songs

5520478 o you who believe avoid much suspicion indeed some suspicion is a sin and spy not on one an other neither backbite one another
5520479 beware of suspicion for suspicion is the worst of false tales do not look for others faults do not spy on one another do not practice najash biding over one another do not be jealous of one another do not hate one another and do not desert or stop talking to one another o allahs worshippers be brothers

5520487 fays center was over key west at about 5 p m the national hurricane center said on monday afternoon monroe county emergency officials suspended their evacuation efforts for the florida keys saying it was time for everyone to stay indoors
5520488 for years marathon has been telling us that they are great environmental performers but theyre not theyre frauds
5520489 she fit right in those are the words of this defendant
5520490 shes simply trying to put the pieces of the evening together

5520494 i just want to sit here for awhile and be left alone without burdens and responsibilities and the need to make decisions
5520495 cannot hold a good man down without his own assistance that is the part i am working on getting out of my own way and realizing that i am not responsible for every bad thing in my life just how i deal with it
5520496 yes i have already bought a few houses that the foundation has built the cost price 150 000 is amazing so i am thinking of buying some more
5520497 people always tend to poke fun at those who like to do such things i really appreciate brad and angie for going the extra mile and putting their time and money to good use
5520498 i believe the chief beneficiaries of the olympic games will be consumer and travel related stocks and within these sectors ive chosen six stocks poised to bring home olympic gold from beijing
5520499 we saw a 19 gain in the spanish stock market in the 12 months before the 1992 barcelona olympics and the 27 gain in the greek stock market in the year before the 2004 athens olympics
5520500 it seems like every person i see in china has a cell phone glued to their ear and the cell phone is not just the primary voice communication medium in china it is also the common way most chinese access the internet and email in china the cell phone is the personal computer
5520501 heck most new high rise condominium and apartment complexes being built in china arent even wired for land lines
5520502 china is booming but most chinese still cant afford tvs personal computers or cars because of that the only way for companies to reach those consumers is through billboards and video monitors strategically placed in heavily traveled areas like elevators train stations and bus stops
5520503 focus media is the dominant advertising firm in china so every company that wants to reach people attending or watching the beijing olympics will be spending millions on focus media ads
5520504 while most affluent foreigners will stay in fancy western hotel chains like the ritz carlton the more budget conscious travelers like me will be checking into one of these spotlessly clean bargain priced rooms at the fastest growing hotel chain in china
5520505 at less than 40 a night home inns was running at a 90 plus occupancy rate but they are already sold out for the olympics at triple the price whats more the companys tremendous value proposition will make it a big big winner for many years after the olympics
5520506 ctrip is chinas largest travel agency and odds are good that it will be handling the hotel and airline reservations for many chinese travelers
5520507 in fact business is already skyrocketing and the olympics are six months away ctrip recently reported its quarterly results and they were spectacular a 52 increase in revenues and a 58 increase in profits thats an amazing growth rate and yet ctrip only sells for 33 times earnings
5520508 plus american investors still dont get the idea that ctrip has a unique and proprietary payment system in a country where credit cards are close to nonexistent
5520509 hungry visitors are going to swarm yums restaurants during the summer games
5520510 many kfc and pizza huts already have lines snaking around the block but i bet those stores will be packed morning noon and night during the olympics you better believe that yum brands will be making some very big profits during the summer games
5520511 beijing is going to be flooded with foreign visitors and very few of them will speak mandarin thats why any chinese worker with even basic english skills is going to be in very high demand and very well paid
5520512 that opportunity isnt lost on the chinese and they are signing up in droves for basic english classes at new oriental education and while the payoff at the olympics may be immediate the long term payoff for acquiring english skills is to the moon that means plenty of future business for edu
5520513 the pullback in chinese shares is opening up a great opportunity i am not suggesting that you rush out and buy all of these stocks today as always you should do your own research
5520514 and while weakness could continue in the short term it is also creating what looks like a great long term opportunity after all the chinese economy may be the most powerful economic phenomenon in history and when you throw fuel on the fire by adding in the 2008 olympic games in beijing the countrys stock market could explode with potential
5520515 ive spent 1 308 days tracking its price movements and written 11 239 words expounding its virtues
5520516 if i could only recommend one stock to own for the next decade hands down yum brands would be the one
5520517 and the transition and timing couldnt be more perfect more than half the words investable market capitalization is now outside the united states and that percentage keeps growing
5520518 approximately 95 of the world population lives outside the united states and roughly 71 of world gross domestic product is now generated outside the our borders and that percentage is growing too
5520519 in other words its hardly a time to have a home country bias if youre an american the future of business and the best growth opportunities squarely reside in international markets especially in china and in the end yum represents an easy way to embrace this reality
5520520 with it we get all the china growth we want without all the china risk we get all the international growth we want without all the risk and we get a history of doubling our money every three and a half years
5520521 such growth and reliability is hard to come by so grab it while you can and ill check back in 10 years to let you know how weve done every investor should own a few shares
5520522 china continues to prove its the crown jewel in the yum business portfolio
5520523 we can not move to a place that does not have a popeyes period

5520530 growing doubts from scientists about the strength of the governments case against the late bruce e ivins the military researcher named as the anthrax killer are forcing the justice department to begin disclosing more fully the scientific evidence it used to implicate him that is going to be critically important because right now there is really no data to make a scientific judgment one way or the other brad smith a molecular biologist at the center for biosecurity at the university of pittsburgh medical center the information that has been put out there is really very little scientific information in there f b i officials say they are confident that their scientific evidence against dr ivins who killed himself last month as the justice department was preparing an indictment against him will withstand scrutiny and they plan to present their findings for review by leading scientists but the scrutiny may only raise fresh questions
5520531 senator chuck grassley today announced that the u s department of health and human services has awarded the iowa department of public health a 4 113 883 grant through the hospital preparedness program the iowa department of public health must use the funds to help pay for the following capabilities an interoperable communication system bed tracking system emergency system for the advance registration of volunteer health professionals fatality management plans and hospital evacuation plans the funds may be optionally used to pay for the following capabilities alternate care sites mobile medical assets pharmaceutical caches personal protective equipment and decontamination the funds must incorporate the national incident management system education and preparedness training and exercises evaluations and corrective actions into the development and maintenance of all capabilities
5520532 there are 326 laboratories authorized by the cdc to work with biological agents an increase from 194 in 2003 another 73 are authorized by the usda the criteria include that the individual have no convictions of a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year not be a fugitive from justice or an illegal alien and that the individual not have been dishonorably discharged from the army of the 399 institutions registered to work with biological agents 234 are working with anthrax the records show many of them are working with or at least storing the ames strain which was used in the anthrax mailings martin hugh jones a professor at louisiana state university said obtaining permission to work with that strain has become almost like a status symbol for labs lsu was one of 16 laboratories identified by the fbi as working with the ames strain of anthrax before the letters were mailed
5520533 ravi s kane professor of chemical and biological engineering at rensselaer polytechnic institute has won the 2008 young investigator award from the american institute of chemical engineers nanoscale science and engineering forum in a recent publication in nature nanotechnology kanes team demonstrated for the first time that upon exposure to invisible and near infrared light carbon nanotubes mediate the selective deactivation of attached proteins kanes group used this phenomenon to design nanotube peptide conjugates that selectively destroy anthrax toxin from a mixture of proteins the group also used these findings to develop and create transparent self cleaning nanotube coatings
5520534 the development of a transparent coating that causes water to bead up into drops and roll or bounce off a surface will help protect and sustain air force systems by preventing corrosion and reducing ice formation on optical elements and aircraft their recent work has opened the door to new applications that exploit the way the coated surface interacts with liquid droplets when water droplets roll along the coated surface they pick up debris as they go doctor brinker explained that this property might make the collection concentration and identification of aerosol borne particles like anthrax possible
5520535 the lab called the national bio and agro defense facility would eventually replace a 24 acre research complex on plum island just off the northeastern tip of long island in the sound although a spokeswoman for homeland security has said that an expansion and upgrade of the facility at plum island is still on the table that proposal is costly and apparently not ranked highly among the agencys preferred plans overruling their own advisers homeland security officials selected flora miss that site was ranked 14th out of 17 locations around the country on grounds that it was too remote from existing biodefense programs and researchers with expertise in contagious diseases
5520536 i am pleased to see that defence is providing an environment where the adf member and their family can discuss in a confidential manner all aspects of their transition
5520537 vitally the new transition service is working actively with other government agencies such as the department of veterans affairs and comsuper
5520538 the iprc is designed to ensure that indigenous australians are well prepared for the adf recruiting process and are equipped to succeed in military training and employment
5520539 it will be run over eight weeks and will include such modules as numeracy and english literacy aptitude confidence building motivation discipline leadership communication and skills to live away from home
5520540 it is hoped this initial trial in townsville will prove a real step forward in assisting indigenous australian take on a rewarding career in the military
5520541 the course offers all participants the chance to visit adf establishments in townsville and cairns as well as a week long trip to canberra for a leadership program
5520542 at the completion of the iprc those that are not eligible for the adf recruitment process will be supported to find suitable employment in other arenas
5520543 consumers were happy to embrace standard dvd when that format arrived because the improvement in quality over vhs videotapes was dramatic standard dvd didnt require the purchase of a new tv either in contrast while half of the respondents to our survey rated quality as much better than standard dvd another 40 termed it only somewhat better and most are very satisfied with the performance of their current dvd players

5520545 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time

5520573 however a number of prison officers have been working too much overtime and this has become an occupational health and safety issue

5520575 of course prison officers will continue to earn overtime that is part of the 24 hour job of supervising and managing the states 32 correctional centres but excessive overtime will be stamped out

5520577 in fact i cant think of any competition in the olympics or all of sportsworld more creepy and disturbing these largely shapeless girls in their leotards and flaxen waxen hair and bouncy wouncy ponytails
5520578 during the olympics when a female gymnast finishes an event and hugs her coach often a man three times her age i cringe at what i believe is the unsavory stench of the sport in general children under the wing of men who based on lengthy documentation have proven to be abusive relentless intolerant humiliating and in some instances accused of sexual misconduct
5520579 for the mothers and young daughters who watch in droves olympic female gymnasts represent the little princess fantasy perfect pixies in those perfect ponytails for the men who watch they may say they do so because of the pure sport of it but for some the voyeuristic fantasy is part of the mix as well these older men little girl relationships that remind me for some reason of the louis malle film pretty baby and brooke shields role as a coquettish 12 year old prostitute in new orleans in the early 1900s

5520668 great news for anyone whos ever dreamed of buying video games from the borg we suppose

5520672 this generation of students has always interacted through new media the days of recruiting at a table in a high school are done
5520673 youre getting an almost real time perspective from students who are in the college and in the programs that potential students are interested in
5520674 the internet and social media are one piece of a larger puzzle that leads to a more holistic recruitment experience
5520675 its not only about myspace and its not only about tabling high school campuses the magic happens somewhere in between
5520676 if i felt stiff its because i was standing around too much the last couple days

5520711 helicopters are marvelous when theyre used for what theyre good at but you dont use them to fly thousands of people between boston and chicago for that you need 747s
5520712 im convinced this is the only way we in vermont are going to get access to this high speed stuff
5520713 weve been at the tail end of the dog for a long time
5520714 were finally coming back around to ideas that were around before the corporate franchise was shown to be a failure
5520715 so much money was being spent to push the corporate model that it was all cities heard about there was no pr or marketing for community wireless groups but unlike the corporations their focus has always been maximizing the public good
5520716 i firmly believe that every public access tv operation every community radio station every nonprofit community technology center can be doing this
5520717 its not rocket science all of those technology based nonprofits are strapped for revenue weve got to figure out a way to capture some of those digital dollars that are falling out of our communities and this is it
5520718 having the city itself as the anchor tenant gives the provider an incentive to set up a good network
5520719 from the get go theres a set amount of money philadelphia never had that deal san francisco never had that deal
5520720 if a private company decides they just arent going to do it anymore the community is stuck because its privately owned
5520721 if its publicly owned and the network is not going exactly as planned they can decide if its still worth it for their police officers to have access if its still worth it to have inspectors and social workers be able to enter their data remotely if its still worth it for citizens to be able to connect anywhere they can ask those questions and decide whether its good for the community or not
5520722 u s internet is not investing in a mobile handset project and trying to still provide dsl service and outsourcing their customer service to india this is their main project
5520723 if youre not sending money out to shareholders across the country and expecting a huge return on investment

5520725 universal affordable access for broadband technology by the year 2007
5520726 we have a failure on the national level thats too important to ignore
5520727 not to view broadband as a strategic asset is a significant shortcoming the other leading countries of the world do view broadband in that light and they are thinking about how to get more of it at much faster speeds and lower rates because its a platform for so many other things that are important
5520728 is make sure that communities that want to solve their own problems that want to build the network they need can do that
5520729 if we open up the unused spaces between the television channels it suddenly becomes possible to deploy the network that we need at a quarter of the cost
5520730 as president i will set a simple goal every american should have the highest speed broadband access no matter where you live or how much money you have well connect schools libraries and hospitals and well take on special interests to unleash the power of wireless spectrum for our safety and connectivity
5520731 we need to start looking at this as an infrastructure issue rather than as a business
5520732 we dont ask cities and towns to cost justify bringing in fresh water and having a sewer system when we could outsource it to private companies nobody says why should my town compete with the private water market i can get perrier why should i have water we treat water as a utility we do the same thing with electricity we have to take the same attitude here toward broadband
5520733 we will continue to relentlessly pursue those individuals who choose to trade access download and publish online child abuse images and child exploitation material
5520734 and if you are one of those people know that police could be knocking on your door tomorrow
5520735 however a number of prison officers have been working too much overtime and this has become an occupational health and safety issue
5520736 the department believes it is important that there is a balance between work and time away from the demands of the job and we want officers to have more quality time at home
5520737 of course prison officers will continue to earn overtime that is part of the 24 hour job of supervising and managing the states 32 correctional centres but excessive overtime will be stamped out

5520775 we look to win every game although our previous matches have been against two of the top sides in europe
5520776 this is the last time we will be together before the serious stuff starts and its so important to win
5520777 northern ireland will be a tough test and have real talent in kyle lafferty and david healy they beat georgia 4 1 recently and that shows their capabilities but were at home and must have belief be positive and take the game to them because thats what well try to do in macedonia
5520778 i will ask the midfielders to play as high up as possible and get into scoring positions paul hartley darren fletcher scott brown and barry robson are all capable of getting goals its vital to get into the habit of scoring as world cup qualifying might be tight so a few goals could make the difference
5520779 the game against northern ireland will be a difficult test for us ahead of the world cup qualifying campaign

5520814 i hope the horrible image of me will make other young people think twice before they next use a sunbed
5520815 while young people may be using sunbeds as they think they make them look good now in the long term they are doing serious damage to their looks
5520816 sandi thom only used sunbeds three times a week which we would not regard as causing overexposure to uv rays

5520887 the water sharing agreement is a major health and safety victory for the city of new berlin
5520888 after being ordered by the state department of natural resources to resolve the threat posed by radium contaminated wells in the central third of new berlin or face substantial fines our engineers researched a number of alternatives repairing the system would cost many millions of dollars and purchasing water from racine or oak creek would not be cost effective at this time the agreement with the city of milwaukee is the best combination of cost and providing new berlin citizens with the safest healthiest water available
5520889 our joint and successful efforts such as passage of the great lakes compact and the water talks between our two cities show the good that can come from suburban and urban leaders finding ways to work cooperatively
5520890 the city of new berlin looks forward to finalizing these agreements with the city of milwaukee and to future positive partnerships

5520934 coal burning leaves toxic heavy metal legacy in the arctic
5520935 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and 70s the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s
5520936 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies
5520937 contamination of other sectors may be increasing because of the rapid coal driven growth of asian economies

5520961 cleaning up red tape for retailers operating across state borders is an important agenda for the ara and while the nationalisation of consumer laws will provide some consistency across the current contradictory requirements educating retailers is the best way to protect consumers
5520962 if retailers were well informed and educated about their consumer law requirements many disputes would be avoided while this is a step in the right direction we are encouraging governments to provide support and education to retailers when they bring in their new legislation
5520963 incorporate amendments reflecting best practice in state and territory legislation
5520964 there is still a need to address wider regulatory burdens and inconsistencies across archaic state laws including oh amp s retail leasing payroll tax and food safety in this time of economic uncertainty business needs to see the federal government easing bureaucratic burden

5520979 weve announced a process to look at ways that we can broaden the funding base for australian sport and i doubt very much that that will come up with a lottery being a viable option for us
5520980 despite continued low levels of activity in the australian housing market
5520981 in the usa increased benefits from structured cost reduction programs will be delivered but we expect us earnings to decline further with housing starts of around 900 000 compared with 1 13 million in fiscal 2008
5520982 we expect continued competitive market conditions and input cost pressures in asia particularly in construction materials

5521025 if it were true that older kids are able to learn at a faster rate then the differences in test scores should get bigger as kids progress and the material gets more difficult but we really see the opposite
5521026 kids learn at lot before kindergarten especially if theyre in preschool one way to think about it is that the oldest kid in kindergarten has about 20 percent more life experience
5521027 but once they start they basically learn at the same rate
5521028 older kids may do better at first but theres a tradeoff
5521029 theyre also a year in school behind other kids their own age at the end of the line somehow that year will catch up to them they start work a year later and parents have an extra year of child care costs if they delay entry so its not free
5521030 what we think is going on is that teachers are comparing younger kids to older classmates and the younger kids tend to stand out
5521031 they stand out either as not doing as well or they tend to stand out as being more hyperactive
5521032 older kids do better at first and younger kids do worse but they catch up
5521033 the thing is schools are making profound decisions based on these differences differences that tend to fade away
5521034 its clear the pattern is these academic differences get smaller as kids get older
5521035 it doesnt seem reasonable to us that there could be large long term gains from starting kindergarten at an older age when there isnt much of an effect for kids in eighth grade
5521036 whether they go to school earlier or later thats really not going to matter much at the end of the day
5521037 creemos que el mayor efecto d lar ya se produjo ning n experto predice que vaya a haber una mayor alza en el futuro y por fortuna al menos de lo que queda de este a o pareci ramos estar en niveles normales de agua por lo tanto ese tampoco deber a ser un factor al alza en el corto plazo

5521048 helps restaurants and its customers become more environmentally sustainable in ways that are convenient and cost effective
5521049 its something that every restaurant nine out of ten restaurants can do
5521050 wed like to lead the charge and help create a more sustainable environment for everybody else in philadelphia
5521051 we saw how much waste we were producing and we see how much take out restaurants produce waste with the green restaurant association they take what youre doing in your store and they make it better
5521052 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5521053 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5521054 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5521055 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5521056 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

5521058 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5521059 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5521060 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5521061 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5521062 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5521063 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5521064 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5521065 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5521066 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5521067 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5521068 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5521069 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5521070 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5521071 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5521072 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5521073 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5521074 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5521075 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5521076 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

5521081 i flew in two days ago to prepare the boat
5521082 not much to do on a dock like this but add extra lines and make sure the boat can rise and fall with the tide
5521083 this isnt a hurricane if the media wasnt down here hyping this up this would be a non event
5521084 after seeing what happened in new orleans and that area i think early evacuation of visitors is important for safety especially in the keys where we only have one road out lives are more important than revenue
5521085 they should continue to stay calm and be smart and make sure they exercise common sense
5521086 i was very aggressive throwing the first pitch for strikes
5521087 that allowed me to go out there for the ninth i was just doing my job
5521088 without question this was his best outing of the year it probably was the second best outing ive ever seen him throw after the nlcs playoff game in 2005
5521089 every one of us on the starting staff tries to put up good innings and quality starts and hope for the best
5521090 we have been able to do that but unfortunately it hasnt gone my way thats baseball

5521099 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5521100 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5521101 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5521102 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5521103 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5521104 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5521105 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5521106 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5521107 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5521108 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5521109 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5521110 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5521111 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5521112 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5521113 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5521114 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5521115 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5521116 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5521117 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5521118 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5521119 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5521120 by editing cnn and pbs news stories so that some saw a skeptic included in the report others saw a story in which the skeptic was edited out and another group saw no video krosnick found that adding 45 seconds of a skeptic to one news story caused 11 of americans to shift their opinions about the scientific consensus rather than 58 believing a perceived scientific agreement inclusion of the skeptic caused the perceived amount of agreement to drop to 47
5521121 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5521122 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5521123 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5521124 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

5521129 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5521130 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

5521137 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5521138 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5521139 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

5521144 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5521145 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

5521169 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5521170 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5521171 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

5521187 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
5521188 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
5521189 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
5521190 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
5521191 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e

5521198 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche

5521208 his understanding and familiarity with the political history of european countries achieved by years of study and firsthand observation admirably qualify him for this responsible work

5521210 i grew up in this church i was a nerdy mess of orthodontics and peach plastic eyeglasses but the congregation at first baptist welcomed me with open arms as a child of god
5521211 now at the end of what had been a gut wrenching week in which i had been strong for everyone else i needed to be wrapped in that faith again
5521212 the pronouncement and the matter of fact tone in which it was delivered knocked the wind out of me
5521213 for i was hungry and you gave me something to eat i was thirsty and you gave me something to drink i was a stranger and you invited me in
5521214 by the time i graduated from high school however those gospel lessons had been subsumed by a different kind of politics at my church
5521215 with pastor mikes words still ricocheting inside my head i bristled at his implication the god of abraham and isaac the god who created the heavens and the earth the god i was taught to trust and obey could not be squeezed into the narrow confines of partisan politics he wasnt anybodys campaign surrogate and he certainly didnt do endorsements baptists believe in an active and engaged god but there is a difference between believing that the hand of god occasionally intervenes in human events and that it pulls the lever for republican candidates
5521216 clintons moral failure became the proof many skeptics needed to expose what they had always believed to be the insincerity of his religious convictions

5521218 dont you understand that this man does not deserve grace
5521219 conservative christians who hold as a key theological doctrine that man is inherently sinful

5521221 yes four thousand abortions take place every day but nine thousand people will die from hiv aids today thirty thousand children will die of malnutrition or from diseases spread by unclean drinking water how can i say that abortions are more important than anything else we need to broaden what life issues are
5521222 jesus tells us that the real spiritual renewal that we need requires a faith that goes beyond even accepting the truth of his message it requires literally a movement toward the person of jesus an attachment that requires us to live our lives in a manner that reflects the fullness of our faith and that allows jesus to become for us truly a lifesaving force
5521223 the bible tells us that in others we encounter the face of god i was hungry and you fed me thirsty and you gave me a drink i was a stranger and you received me in your home naked and you clothed me this is the final judgment of who we are and what our life will mean
5521224 theres nothing conservative or political in singing about jesus at the top of your lungs

5521236 i went to the show in cincinnati and there was alcohol being served

5521238 an aside in my experience most conversations about alcohol with those who adamantly reject it as a possible beverage choice present that it could cause a brother to stumble
5521239 and finally i should state the reasons we went on a tour that had as its venues bars and clubs exclusively we wished for the story of god to be experienced beyond the safety of our cloistered church environments it was our deep hope that many who would not frequent a bar would come join us and experience the reality of the presence of god in an environment that they might not typically suspect to experience such a thing in we believe if we are reading scripture correctly that once the veil was torn that in an instant suddenly god was everywhere the symbolism and consequences of this moment are epic the way human beings access the maker of heaven and earth were forever changed suddenly once and for all through the ultimate sacrificial offering suddenly he is everywhere every second is lived in the very presence of god there is no moment that is not holy there is no space that is not sacred it is the awareness of our reality that shifts not this reality therefore all that is needed for our awareness to change and we begin to view spaces and people and cultures and music and art and eating and drinking and sleeping and waking as moments and spaces and places where god is already active and present our hope on this tour was to give people a physical tangible experience of this reality
5521240 did you see that article in the paper about ginghamsburg
5521241 truth does not exist ive decided to become a combination of a buddhist and a muslim and i think today would be a good day to start burning all of our american flags

5521244 all i can do is be me whoever that is
5521245 the only caveat and weve expressed it publicly many times is that the cuts cannot simply be transferring costs to local government and thereby putting pressure on the property tax that were trying to avoid the increases in
5521246 ive got over 600 e mails here on a daily basis talking about youve got to go back to albany and youve got to fix this
5521247 the sheriffs department has 180 000 for some high tech equipment now its something thats needed but its something that may not need to happen this year
5521248 we cant ask others to do what were not willing to do ourselves we cant cut vital services i dont see us being able to cut health care
5521249 there is a proposal out there its been out there since june to raise taxes on the very wealthy the upper two or three percent of wage earners in the state
5521250 we have the armory growing its expanding out towards franklin square so were really at a point now where were seeing a lot going on and we just wanted to make sure that the momentum continues
5521251 the gas prices are definitely affecting people theyre even affecting realtors people are looking at their overall budget when theyre trying to put together a mortgage payment it definitely is something that would affect them
5521252 the sellers and buyers are out there its the banks causing the slowdown the money isnt as readily available as it used to be
5521253 buyers are a little more cautious they still see good value and when they see it they act on it but they are taking a little bit longer timeframe

5521261 mechanical engineers over the next two decades will be called upon to develop technologies that foster a cleaner healthier safer and sustainable global environment
5521262 this large and growing population will need access to food and clean water effective sanitation energy education healthcare and affordable transportation
5521263 this market is not populated by poor victims of circumstance but resilient and creative entrepreneurs and potential customers there is tremendous value in helping these people achieve a better quality of life at present most engineering schools do not address the needs of destitute people even though many of these people live in industrialized countries yet the needs of the underserved for engineering solutions are likely to increase as population grows teaching engineers how to develop locally appropriate engineering solutions for the underserved is a key to developing sustainably for example engineers without borders is fostering sustainable development and teaching engineers valuable skills for the future
5521264 by 2028 advances in computer aided design materials robotics nanotechnology and biotechnology will democratize the process of designing and creating new devices
5521265 creating a renaissance for engineering entrepreneurs the engineering workforce will change as more engineers work at home as part of larger decentralized engineering companies or as independent entrepreneurs
5521266 faster processing and network speeds will soon allow future engineers to design entire products as a system rather than separate pieces this will expand the capacities of engineers and enable more complex designs to be completed anywhere
5521267 within 20 years it is likely that home based personal fabricators will be economically attractive and available to anyone who wants them engineers will be able to act as independent operators interacting with colleagues around the world they can design at home with advanced cad systems or in collaboration with their global colleagues in virtual worlds they will be able to use home based fabrication technology to test many of their designs engineers of the future will have better tools to build careers as individual inventors independent entrepreneurs and employees in distributed businesses that draw on engineering talent from around the world
5521268 virtual worlds could soon become truly interactive environments for interacting with colleagues combined with advances in cad systems it will be possible for mechanical engineers to collaborate in immersive interactive environments where they can design collaboratively test hypothesis run models and simulations and observe their creations in three dimensions much as an engineer can observe a car being built with their colleagues on the shop floor
5521269 whenever society has needed great contribution from mechanical engineering in the past the profession has stepped up to the challenge all that will be different in 2028 is the increased scope of the challenges and the increased number of people who will be living in a cleaner healthier safer and sustainable world because mechanical engineers believed they should

5521285 despite an increasingly difficult enterprise spending environment in the u s and parts of europe reasonable growth expectations strength in emerging countries currency and product cycles should be enough to drive some upside for each company
5521286 theyre very high growth economies but theyre still subject to volatility
5521287 i think chinas just kind of a who knows its so hot it has to come down eventually
5521288 even if china goes from 25 percent to 15 percent year over year growth it can cause some volatility

5521290 i think that hp continues to be very upbeat about what it can do with eds and will go to great lengths on the conference call to convince people of that
5521291 share gains on the inkjet side combined with stronger emerging market growth on the laser side should drive another quarter of mid single digit revenue growth in printers and operating margin above 15 percent
5521292 even against a tough comparison we expect hp to maintain double digit pc revenue growth on strength outside of the u s
5521293 if it does continue to strengthen you could see some of that be a headwind to top line growth
5521294 the u s is obviously still a very important region for these companies
5521295 people know its weak but does it get worse i would argue even the u s business has not been as bad as people have said

5521297 yes everything falls apart this world is moving from complex to chaos a trillion years process of the universe spreading out so in the cosmic sense i realize were all fucking doomed as a criticism of some of the obama questions ive been posing ive heard a defense of incremental ism the idea is that throughout human history great revolutions social sexual governmental etc they start strong uncompromising and are eventually a high water mark on the slow march of human progress
5521298 i shall never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds

5521311 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5521312 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5521313 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things

5521332 this is an m47 patton tank engine with twin turbos it has 1 600 horsepower and weighs about five tons
5521333 thats not really much when you consider the engine is meant to move a 120 000 pound tank maybe you build cars like this when you have more money than brains but ive driven it to work and its gotten up to 145 mph at the gm proving grounds
5521334 actually most people dont know this is really a hybrid it starts off running on gas then you get on the freeway and it runs on even more gas
5521335 and the best news of all with the 1 million plus we raised for our charities this year the pebble beach concours has now contributed well over 11 million during the events history

5521390 gandhi believed in serving humanity and seva bharati is also doing the same
5521391 any award named after mahatma gandhi should only be conferred on an institution or a person dedicated to gandhian principles but the award conferred on an organisation allied to the rss raises doubts on the intentions of the government already working on saffron agenda it is an insult to gandhi
5521392 it was unfortunate and biggest injustice done by this government in the name of gandhi it was also a direct attack on gandhian principles
5521393 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil so the compact that is in effect obviously needs to be renegotiated i think that theres a movement to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
5521394 senator mccains position on opening up the colorado river compact is absolutely wrong and would only happen over my dead body
5521395 on this issue he couldnt be more wrong nothing is more crucial for colorado than water and i oppose any suggestion that the federal government should get involved in how we share it with arizona california or any other state
5521396 he will not get a more fierce fight from a united states senator than he will have from me
5521397 let me make one thing perfectly clear i would never advocate any course of action that would damage the state of colorados rights over the water or any other water resources that is going to be one of the most precious commodities for colorado and the entire west

5521408 i have found you because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of the lord
5521409 and also concerning jezebel the lord says dogs will devour jezebel by the wall of jezreel
5521410 dogs will eat those belonging to ahab who die in the city and the birds of the air will feed on those who die in the country
5521411 when ahab heard these words he tore his clothes put on sackcloth and fasted he lay in sackcloth and went around meekly
5521412 have you noticed how ahab has humbled himself before me because he has humbled himself i will not bring this disaster in his day but i will bring it on his house in the days of his son

5521418 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5521419 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5521420 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5521421 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5521422 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5521423 ha ha ha of course i ski who doesnt around here
5521424 im planning a trip to marmot next weekend there will be 6 of us you my dear are coming
5521425 oh dont worry we all are after a season goes by you will be fine
5521426 oh the tangled web we weave when we practice to deceive
5521427 ok you guys head off for a bit im gonna get practice time in
5521428 i am going to prove myself here i can do this
5521429 oh you are gonna just love this run elaine i promise it is going to be a highlight of your trip
5521430 oh no not so fast we are not starting with the best
5521431 ok we had best get on with the real skiing now
5521432 sure just a bit cold is all i will be fine
5521433 because you are prone to doing illogical and irrational actions dangerous to your health and well being
5521434 your just jelous because i can sing so beautifuly and you cant
5521435 i t is important to estimate expected atmospheric carbon dioxide levels for realistic estimates of fossil fuel reserves and to determine how the carbon dioxide level depends upon possible constraints on coal use
5521436 peak oil emission occurs in 2016 plus or minus two years peak gas in 2026 plus or minus two years and peak coal in 2077 plus or minus two years
5521437 is meant to approximate a situation in which developed countries freeze their carbon dioxide emissions from coal by 2012 and a decade later developing countries similarly halt increases in coal emissions
5521438 phase out of coal use except where the carbon is captured and stored below ground is the primary requirement for solving global warming oil is used in vehicles where it is impractical to capture the carbon but oil is running out to preserve our planet we must also ensure that the next mobile energy source is not obtained by squeezing oil from coal
5521439 e ven if coal reserves are much lower than historically assumed there is surely enough coal to take the world past 450 ppm carbon dioxide without mitigation efforts such as those described here
5521440 the sum of all fossil resources that the industry considers available is presented annually in bp statistical review according to this rather optimistic estimate the total energy of all oil natural gas and coal amounts to 36 zeta joules zj a gigantic amount of energy this is more than what our research group considers likely but it is still less than what do the sres scenario families a1 a2 b1 and b2 require up to 2100 ipcc prognosticates that a2 will need between seventy and ninety zj that is twice as much as the industry believes is available we need a new assessment of future temperature increases based on a realistic consumption of oil natural gas and coal
5521441 our producer limited profile has future fossil fuel production that is lower than all forty of the ipcc scenarios so it seems that producer limitations could provide useful constraints in climate modeling
5521442 the producer limited profile gives a peak of 460 ppm in 2070
5521443 our current analysis suggests that humanity must aim for an even lower level of greenhouse gases paleoclimate data and ongoing global changes indicate that slow climate feedback processes not included in most climate models such as ice sheet disintegration vegetation migration and greenhouse gas release from soils tundra or ocean sediments may begin to come into play on time scales as short as centuries or less rapid on going climate changes and realization that earth is out of energy balance implying that more warming is in the pipeline add urgency to investigation of the dangerous level of greenhouse gases we use paleoclimate data to show that long term climate has high sensitivity to climate forcings and that the present global mean carbon dioxide 385 ppm is already in the dangerous zone ongoing arctic and ice sheet changes examples of rapid paleoclimate change and other criteria cited above all drive us to consider scenarios that bring carbon dioxide more rapidly back to 350 ppm or less
5521444 f uture costs and benefits are taken to have a lower value than present costs and benefits we can think of the discount rate as the rate of return which is required on capital invested by the company the higher the discount rate the lower the value of future costs against present costs for example a cost of 200 000 which occurs twenty years in the future has a net present value of 44 000 at five percent and 10 400 at ten percent discount rate the further into the future costs and benefits arise the lower their value compared with present costs and benefits

5521448 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5521449 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5521450 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5521451 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

5521453 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5521454 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5521455 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5521456 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5521457 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5521458 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5521459 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5521460 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5521461 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5521462 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5521463 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5521464 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5521465 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5521466 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5521467 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5521468 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5521469 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5521470 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5521471 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5521472 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5521473 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5521474 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5521475 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5521476 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5521477 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5521478 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5521479 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5521480 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5521481 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5521482 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5521483 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5521484 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5521485 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5521486 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5521487 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5521488 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5521489 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5521490 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5521491 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5521492 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5521493 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5521494 los goles de los centauros fueron por obra de guillermo franco daniel simental y jorge n ez el nico gol de la honra en tiempo de compensaci n fue de jos alejandro zamora
5521495 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5521496 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5521497 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5521498 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5521499 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5521500 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5521501 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5521502 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5521503 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5521504 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5521505 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5521506 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5521507 who are open to doing something on the production side
5521508 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5521509 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5521510 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

5521518 usually you see bait fish on the water you dont see no bait fish nothing nothings there
5521519 i dont have no kind of testing material to test the water but i know somethings wrong
5521520 were not finding enough oxygen to support life aquatic life
5521521 this green line is the oxygen right here and at the bottom its reading less than 2 milligrams per liter
5521522 theres no oxygen in the water for shrimp crabs fish to live
5521523 can sense that and they start to move out of the area otherwise they would die the animals that still remain in the sediments have to keep breathing there is not enough oxygen and eventually they will die off
5521524 thats the primary source of the nutrients that go to the gulf of mexico
5521525 and so the size of the low oxygen zone has increased in proportion to these nutrients reaching the gulf
5521526 so these things will fall to the bottom and as they decompose they consume oxygen
5521527 the deeper we go down in the water it gets kind of scary because theres nothing there theres no fish theres no organisms alive so its just us
5521528 its dark and its turbid because all that algae that is dying thats sinking through the water column
5521529 you just gotta keep going miles and miles and miles and hopefully youll run into something
5521530 the fuel costs are so high its just not feasible to get out there unless you can catch a boatload really make any money out of it
5521531 all my boats have to go somewhere else to make a living its a shame
5521532 this is the prime shrimping ground in the country right here and it shut us down it just shut us down its unreal
5521533 oops sorry it couldnt be helped heres your refund sorry bout those nsf fees
5521534 its because you look like the portuguese people around here were all related
5521535 well you guys seem nice but i have to go to my girlfriends family for the weekend so here you go have fun
5521536 make sure to invite me to your next family reunion your family sounds really interesting
5521537 we decided to put on our costumes and parade what might happen we didnt know
5521538 native americans and africans had much in common so we could adapt native american customs easily
5521539 who goes there i have been stalked before much to the regret of my assailants show yourself or i will come for you
5521540 easy dwarf i mean you no harm if i have been stealthy it is only to ascertain that you were not in league with the goblins i have been tracking
5521541 i am known as stub of the thunderslayer clan of crah how are you called
5521542 please call me james as i said i come hunting goblins
5521543 well you may share my fire though i fear i have only meat to offer for sustenance
5521544 i know that to some it seems strange that i would not eat meat its simply part of who i am meat comes from animals and i am a protector of animals and of the forest
5521545 goblins are no more animals than you or i they are abominations who exist only to destroy that which they cannot take by force it is my duty to hunt them and any others who would seek to harm the forest
5521546 it sounds like a lot of work for one man
5521547 it is there are more like me but few this far north i seek to join up with those other rangers i can find in the serpent spine mountains that is why i travel to fort serpents spine and i track goblins along the way
5521548 one of them ran off after i put the fear of dwarves into him
5521549 though well likely not see him again goblins are cowards except when there are many of them or they are cornered i shall track him again in the morning if i can find his trail

5521553 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5521554 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5521555 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5521556 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5521557 while the gold price has eased to around the 800 mark we have simultaneously seen reductions in oil prices and a strengthening in the us dollar which should help to alleviate cost pressures and sustain margins lihir managing director arthur hood said
5521558 for the full year i remain confident of reporting a solid improvement in operating cash flows and net profit after tax
5521559 by the end of this year the lgl group will have four mines in operation producing a total of more than 1 2 million ounces of gold per year providing the company with diversified cashflows and strong future growth potential mr hood said

5521566 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5521567 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5521568 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5521569 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5521570 in 2006 and 2007 i toured with a 17 piece band so i could reproduce the sounds of these days the new album id made
5521571 and it was a lot of fun this year im not out promoting a new album so i wanted to do something really different
5521572 recently i saw james taylor on his tour it was a kind of one man band show with just him a piano player and all those great songs i really enjoyed watching it and i knew i would enjoy performing in that setting as well so im going to tour basically the same way pared down and informal
5521573 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5521574 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5521575 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5521576 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5521577 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

5521588 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time

5521600 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5521601 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

5521605 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5521606 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5521607 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5521608 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5521609 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

5521616 we expect international prices for steel and steelmaking inputs to continue to be volatile but generally remain at high levels by historical standards underpinned by continued strong international demand for steel and steelmaking inputs mr plummer said
5521617 the result highlights the strength of amnesties integrated business model with our major businesses demonstrating their ability to manage well in a volatile cost environment for raw materials ferrous and non ferrous scrap and steel mr plummer said
5521618 if they think main is going to have a new library in a minute theyre crazy
5521619 a temporary library is no small thing you have shelves and computers and conditional use permits
5521620 my concern is that theyre going to vote without fully we wont know what has been voted on with basically the city council saying this will be taken care of
5521621 its just one thing to say you have to close main library and then another thing to have a document that says you have to
5521622 so far there hasnt been anything that says this has to happen other than what the city council and the mayor and the city manager have told us

5521625 there are all sorts of creative ways to get around the conflicts in your life but ignoring them sure isnt one of them procrastination will never ever help you get things done it will only keep you passive step up and take charge of your own life by having that conversation youve been dreading set some time aside later today and try to get face to face with the person whos causing you stress if you cant do that then talk to them on the phone in a quiet location

5521682 however three malicious damage incidents were recorded compared to an average of two across the past seven years
5521683 although there was an increase in malicious damages the outcome of a reduction in assaults is very encouraging

5521728 sorry for all the mondays and to those who cant sing
5521729 you always go testing with a plan and the weather changed that a little bit for us but we were able to do a lot of dry running and also a lot of wet running
5521730 the co drivers for our team dave reynolds and paul radisich managed to get a lot of miles in
5521731 paul and rick were happy to give their respective co drivers a lot of time in the cars even though it is one of only four test days we get during the year
5521732 because of the changes in weather during the test day we have a lot of confidence going into the enduros certainly you would expect the conditions we had during the test would be similar to the weather at phillip island
5521733 we dont have to change much on the cars theyre built to do the distance
5521734 i flew in two days ago to prepare the boat
5521735 not much to do on a dock like this but add extra lines and make sure the boat can rise and fall with the tide
5521736 this isnt a hurricane if the media wasnt down here hyping this up this would be a non event
5521737 they should continue to stay calm and be smart and make sure they exercise common sense
5521738 the process by which a body of water becomes rich in dissolved nutrients thereby encouraging the growth and decomposition of oxygen depleting plant life and resulting harm to other organisms
5521739 first of all chris rock is still married and his wife picked out a beautiful gift for me after we finished shooting a marc jacobs purse it was only a movie
5521740 this is a decision the group made together so that they could continue to evolve as individuals it wasnt forced by me or any of the higher ups or anything like that
5521741 a new disc called greatest hits of rbd will be released this year with 15 of their most popular songs and later theyll record a new album thats slated for an early 2009 release we also want to make a movie but well see how that pans out with the tour and saying goodbye to their fans
5521742 las tontas no van al cielo van al estadio jalisco a ver las birrias
5521743 usually you see bait fish on the water you dont see no bait fish nothing nothings there
5521744 i dont have no kind of testing material to test the water but i know somethings wrong
5521745 were not finding enough oxygen to support life aquatic life
5521746 this green line is the oxygen right here and at the bottom its reading less than 2 milligrams per liter
5521747 theres no oxygen in the water for shrimp crabs fish to live
5521748 can sense that and they start to move out of the area otherwise they would die the animals that still remain in the sediments have to keep breathing there is not enough oxygen and eventually they will die off
5521749 thats the primary source of the nutrients that go to the gulf of mexico
5521750 and so the size of the low oxygen zone has increased in proportion to these nutrients reaching the gulf
5521751 so these things will fall to the bottom and as they decompose they consume oxygen
5521752 the deeper we go down in the water it gets kind of scary because theres nothing there theres no fish theres no organisms alive so its just us
5521753 its dark and its turbid because all that algae that is dying thats sinking through the water column
5521754 you just gotta keep going miles and miles and miles and hopefully youll run into something
5521755 the fuel costs are so high its just not feasible to get out there unless you can catch a boatload really make any money out of it
5521756 all my boats have to go somewhere else to make a living its a shame
5521757 this is the prime shrimping ground in the country right here and it shut us down it just shut us down its unreal
5521758 sorry for all the mondays and to those who cant sing
5521759 the canyon the whole canyon just blew up right there in front of us we heard the roar of the water and it came through like a freight train
5521760 that just scared the bejeezus out of us because we were sleeping trying to sleep we were cold and wet and kind of stranded wondering whats going to happen with us our boats are gone then the second flash flood comes through bigger than the first
5521761 it was just a 100 foot rope sitting from the bottom of a helicopter and they harnessed us up clipped us into the harnesses and then dangled us from the helicopter over the canyon
5521762 you saw last year we finished eighth and we managed to get beaten in the first final
5521763 its nice to get into the finals but if we play finals this year it will be good to play them in good form
5521764 if you limp into them you have then got to determine do you make sure kieren jacks playing in the finals and patrick veszpremis playing in the finals and at least get some experience for those young players
5521765 we might have to bring some young players back in for this week because if you do lose or youre not playing well at least youre gaining something from it
5521766 theres not a lot to be gained losing with the same sort of team at least this year weve introduced a lot of new players
5521767 its all relative if we dont make the eight and we blood some young kids then its a positive
5521768 every team says they have to make the eight at the start of the year and were still in the mix and thats an important factor at this time of year
5521769 id certainly rather be playing games that have a degree of pressure and the young kids are learning something rather than 13th versus 16th or whatever so its good to be involved in the finals and i said that to the players before the game and hopefully they do feel that excitement with two weeks to go
5521770 my focus this week is no different to what it was last week
5521771 i knew last week we needed to win at least another game to play in the finals but that didnt change what we wanted to do against geelong so it doesnt change this week at all weve got to play a lot better this week regardless of where we sit or whats happened with the other teams
5521772 last week i levelled the record and this week i suspect ill break it because i have the full support of the board at the moment
5521773 it is probably something you sit down and think about once your career is finished
5521774 what do you think about favre joining the jets kent

5521779 wow i am amazed that someone would take your comments from your previous posts about
5521780 i liked reading your take on cammo i had never even thought of it
5521781 he was really mean to me and he used to tease me for having hairy arms
5521782 were so looking forward to working with each again and we just need to find a time in our diaries when we can get into the studio together
5521783 we still have a bit of work to do to get to that position
5521784 but there is no doubt wed like to finish fourth it is a great position to be in heading into finals we will be doing everything we can over the next couple of weeks
5521785 within the playing group we have always had high expectations and high standards
5521786 that is just the culture we are developing at this footy club we can be competitive and win games of footy no matter what people think or what everyone thinks of our list our group is very driven we train hard we set high standards and we try to win every game we play that is the way we approach our footy
5521787 we have a talented young list players like nathan van berlo bernie vince chris knights and richard douglas these guys are developing all the time week in week out
5521788 we are getting better and better with those guys performing at the high standard that they are and it is a good time of the year for those guys to be playing their best footy
5521789 the excitement involved with this list at the moment is right up there
5521790 i can see some talent that is really exciting and i rate it right up there with what we had in 2005 2006 when adelaide was a top two club
5521791 in a perfect world youd love jonathan to have signed by now but by the same token im not uneasy at the moment
5521792 would i love him to let me know tomorrow absolutely but im not perturbed at this point in time
5521793 im confident that hell be a lion for life very confident but theres no guarantees what i can say is theres a real focus on the lions retaining jonathan brown jonathan is an extremely important and valuable player
5521794 our whole focus is on ensuring he is aligned for life
5521795 im not concerned about other clubs im not concerned about what theyre offering or what theyre alleged to have offered or what theyre speculated to have offered
5521796 were going to go for an american sweep 1 2 3 and see what happens

5521804 my favorites would be cal stanford oregon state washington boise state oregon and unlv id like to hear more from ucla and hopefully washington state
5521805 first of all academics because i want to go into law
5521806 i want to make sure that i weigh all of my options when i start getting offers
5521807 i want to make sure i know which school i want it will probably be right next to the deadline loi day
5521808 my other blog got hacked amp injected with link spam
5521809 so we wanted to make sure the capital would sustain us through at least three failures and if we get three failures in a row then we dont deserve to be in the rocket business is the basic theory that i had
5521810 in the past ive said that i would accept three consecutive failures however i actually consider this first launch a partial success because we were able to test so much hardware working together in flight that means we still have at least three failures to go before i would even consider throwing in the towel
5521811 my comments need to be put in the proper framework what i said was that if we have three failures in a row we should probably give up because nobody will want to buy our rockets
5521812 for my part i will never give up and i mean never

5521822 the u s mint buys direct from the refiners and this suspension of gold eagle sales may be an indication that the supply line is already backing up or that the mint expects that it will back up for the rest of the year i wonder who would give up physical metal at these prices and under these circumstances except distressed sellers the central banks are in a hunker down mode as far as i can determine and its the mines that supply the refiners so if the mint which buys from the refiners is having a difficult time locating metal what does that tell you i keep saying that we may get a surprising rubber band effect later in the year when the pre holiday festival season kicks off in september october it may happen sooner one of our indicators of approaching a bottom in gold is how many calls centennial precious metals gets from our u s based indian clientele heres a quote from my offices report to me at the end of the day today today was a good day there must have been an indian convention where someone was handing out usagold business cards that may give you a clue as to thinking in india proper and probably the rest of the asian rim
5521823 values go down and tax rates go up and everyone pays a little more and they arent happy
5521824 when values have gone down people have to understand there is a lag time and it doesnt reflect market value
5521825 the hurting is not as bad as in other communities
5521826 an average house in this town is probably assessed at slightly over 500 000 so youre talking about a 550 increase in taxes
5521827 i dont know about you but i think thats a lot to swallow
5521828 in an absolute sense it feels worse because houses went down in value
5521829 the combination of declining property value and increasing property tax creates anxiety for people
5521830 the thought of looking like this when im 57 is terrifying
5521831 having seen these images i can honestly say i am never going to use a sunbed again
5521832 you can so easily get brown from a bottle these days there is just no point in ruining your looks and risking skin cancer by using sunbeds
5521833 i hope the horrible image of me will make other young people think twice before they next use a sunbed
5521834 while young people may be using sunbeds as they think they make them look good now in the long term they are doing serious damage to their looks
5521835 sandi thom only used sunbeds three times a week which we would not regard as causing overexposure to uv rays
5521836 sunbed users are very aware of the risks associated with uv overexposure and most have less than 20 sunbed sessions a year

5521854 but after filming several other of the genres touchstone works dutcher renounced mormonism last year citing a theological evolution he calls
5521855 one of the best small pictures of its kind in recent memory
5521856 in one moment i went from being a true believer to knowing that everything i had thought about god everything i thought about the universe the way i looked at the world might be off
5521857 ironically its the films that allowed me to progress spiritually to the point i left mormonism if i hadnt been making films i doubt i would have reached that point
5521858 at that point the representation of mormons on tv and in movies had been pretty negative it was all polygamy and crazy people really extreme and marginal
5521859 one of my main impulses was to portray mormons as real people
5521860 too many badly made films in the marketplace too few good ones
5521861 one day in prayer all by myself i asked myself the question what if its all not true
5521862 it was an earth shaking moment of spiritual terror such a profound experience it was such a sense of loss i felt my faith leaving me and never coming back
5521863 richard became a local lightning rod because he accepted what might be called an ill informed and premature title like the father of mormon cinema
5521864 he didnt make it up nor did he ask for it but i think hes also done little to distance himself from it
5521865 what youre seeing on his face is exhaustion and despair
5521866 mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused
5521867 lobbies regulatory agencies on alcohol issues that involve public health and safety
5521868 he doesnt listen carefully to people and make reasoned judgments
5521869 if john says im going with so and so you cant count on that the next morning

5521871 the water sharing agreement is a major health and safety victory for the city of new berlin
5521872 after being ordered by the state department of natural resources to resolve the threat posed by radium contaminated wells in the central third of new berlin or face substantial fines our engineers researched a number of alternatives repairing the system would cost many millions of dollars and purchasing water from racine or oak creek would not be cost effective at this time the agreement with the city of milwaukee is the best combination of cost and providing new berlin citizens with the safest healthiest water available
5521873 our joint and successful efforts such as passage of the great lakes compact and the water talks between our two cities show the good that can come from suburban and urban leaders finding ways to work cooperatively
5521874 the city of new berlin looks forward to finalizing these agreements with the city of milwaukee and to future positive partnerships
5521875 a man the other day pointed out that i was never bored i hadnt thought of that before but its true im never bored im appalled horrified angered but never bored the world appears to me so infinite in its variety that many lifetimes could not exhaust its interest so long as you can still be surprised you have something to be thankful for
5521876 two of the pubs near oxford which c s lewis frequented were the trout and the six bells some of lewiss american readers had written him to inquire about his views on drinking alcoholic beverages his response to them was in no uncertain terms i have always in my books been concerned simply to put forward mere christianity and am no guide on these most regrettable interdenominational questions i do however most strongly object to the tyrannic and unscriptural insolence of anything that calls itself a church and makes teetotalism a condition of membership apart from the more serious objection that our lord himself turned water into wine and made wine the medium of the only rite he imposed on all his followers it is so provincial what i believe you people call small town dont they realize that christianity arose in the mediterranean world where then as now wine was as much a part of the normal diet as bread
5521877 im excited to see diablo iii because its a whole new thing theyve got a whole new direction on it they have a few of the guys that worked at blizzard north still around but theres a whole new team on it and its like ok its their license and theyre trying to really move the bar and do something different with the diablo license yeah im excited when i see what theyre coming up with
5521878 i really have no idea what im talking about and im making all this up
5521879 i came into the world not to condemn the world but to save it
5521880 everyone agrees that we need to expand the pipe which means that we can get more people across quicker more efficiently
5521881 and there is a lack of money right now maybe people pay a certain amount to come cross lets assume 5 dont hold me to that but that would then pay the bonds so we can develop infrastructure
5521882 i think its imperative that the following step be taken the president should have already and should do so very quickly convene the presidents working group on financial markets thats something that he can ask the secretary of the treasury to do this has to be coordinated across markets with the regulators here and obviously with regulators and central banks around the world
5521883 t he banking problems in the united states continue to mount while the federal governments deficit continues to soar out of control
5521884 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars
5521885 theres a crisis in the white house and to save the election theyd have to fake a war
5521886 what happened on the night of aug 7 is beyond comprehension the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity the georgian leadership could do this only with the perceived support and encouragement of a much more powerful force
5521887 washingtons bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of south ossetia
5521888 there is great interest in growing your own food so you know whats in it or on it and avoid high prices at the grocery store
5521889 economists say canadian labour force drop shows job boom is over
5521890 55 200 canadian jobs disappeared in july the largest monthly drop since the early 1990s the unemployment rate actually shrank dropping a tenth of a point to 6 1 as an even larger number of people more than 74 000 of them dropped out of the labour force during the month
5521891 edged up by two ticks to 7 4 while in ontario the rate fell to 6 4 from 6 7 in june as 42 000 people left the labour market
5521892 mom was right you are a terrible worthless lazy father who doesnt care about us
5521893 i could have told you that you stupid damned kids
5521894 a gain of nearly 30 000 public sector positions partially offset the loss of 95 000 in the private sector
5521895 since july of 2007 employment in the public sector has grown by 6 1 compared with 0 5 for the private sector
5521896 do you really believe that present inflation is demand driven
5521897 that monetary policy is the root cause of the recent increase in the relative prices of energy and food
5521898 dismisses the critical non monetary factors including increasing commodity demand from strong capacity growth of the global economy coupled with short run supply constraints and various government distortions
5521899 then ask them hey how would you like a new car
5521900 and so you can also forget about capacity growth too because without the money to fuel the demand growth there aint no stinking capacity growth and thus there wont be any short run supply constraints although there will always be various government distortions
5521901 any meaningful steps to establish and maintain maori participation in decision making
5521902 this is not really against the council its against the government
5521903 were making the claim under the treaty to make them central government responsible and hold them accountable for the legislation that they have passed
5521904 to simply fabricate a bad relationship and then slap a treaty claim on it its not a good look
5521905 we obviously dont support those views and we have found it difficult to find anything else to discuss
5521906 as far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case thats ever been charged in this country
5521907 we have been so used to hard drives for so many years windows is optimised for that obviously

5521930 so we needed food on the table there were seven of us besides mother and father nine people ate a lot of food

5521954 a response would be provided 48 hours before the requested rally time officials promised with tuesday marking the last day applications can be lodged human rights watch warned that time was running out for china
5521955 the clock is ticking for the chinese government to demonstrate its good faith regarding these so called protest zones
5521956 we think that you do not really understand chinas reality china has its own version and way of exercising our democracy
5521957 anyone who tries anything like that will face a crushing response
5521958 we are witnessing the start of a withdrawal of troops today and into the night
5521959 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun

5521963 i felt like i was on the brink of something huge i did everything i needed to do and i couldnt have done anything else this is truly how it was supposed to be this definitely answers my question about 2012 in london you can guarantee i will be there the only thing for the davids oliver and payne to do now is to make the podium and shock the world
5521964 writers dna are on fire right now and this team is brilliant
5521965 could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
5521966 i felt the closest thing to depression that i have ever felt in my life
5521967 do you think its ok to write about the prophets sex life
5521968 another example of a quiet wave of self censorship and cultural cowardice sweeping western art circles
5521969 this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community
5521970 at the same time the muslims want to kill me im pandering to them
5521971 when people talk about an offended muslim being the same as a violent muslim to me that sounds like racism
5521972 what a pistol she seemed like someone i would want to know
5521973 scandal blew in on the errant wind when i rode into medina clutching safwans waist my neighbors rushed into the street what they saw my wrapper fallen to my shoulders unheeded loose hair lashing my face the wife of gods prophet entwined around another man
5521974 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer

5521977 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer

5521980 when we have kids its a decision of three people
5521981 when my son was ten i asked him if he wanted to come and we went all round the world changing schools
5521982 when we have kids its a decision of three people
5521983 when my son was ten i asked him if he wanted to come and we went all round the world changing schools
5521984 its just a big deal because its the first time in the lifetime of this community that the city wont have to drive or haul our drinking water its a huge step forward
5521985 this started in earnest in 1992 it actually started in 1986 and now were looking at it happening in 2008 so its been a long grind but its coming to fruition
5521986 that should be out before the end of the year that plus a record of decision should enable us to move forward and connect lake sakakawea to the naws project so we can provide water from the lake as well as obviously to minot and the entire network
5521987 its important for minot because we think the region is important to us therefore we want to keep all of these small cities viable
5521988 this is the kind of infrastructure you need to continue to grow
5521989 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5521990 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5521991 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5521992 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5521993 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here

5521997 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5521998 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5521999 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5522000 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5522001 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5522002 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5522003 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5522004 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5522005 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5522006 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5522007 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5522008 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5522009 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5522010 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5522011 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5522012 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5522013 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5522014 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5522015 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5522016 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5522017 even when were walking i can see into her soul
5522018 the neuroscience is now clear about the effectiveness of mindfulness practice in creating lasting change in people who suffer from depression ocd and other anxiety disorders and on increasing couples happiness and quality of life
5522019 many of the people i talk to are single professional working moms so it was very important to me to create the type of service that would be effective cost wise as well as result wise
5522020 businesswomen and businessmen need the media and the media needs them my goal is to bring the two together and provide equal benefit for both
5522021 if you end up having an unexplained death in this area in the next few weeks call a vet
5522022 its probably not a good idea to cut the antlers off
5522023 financial and other liability must be a primary concern here with any loss of publically owned wildlife from diseased domestic bison
5522024 i think its good that the ceo has to be accountable to somebody i think its good that the chairman is there to give attention to governance issues on a regular basis
5522025 i think if wed had a separation between chairman and ceo in the us wed probably not have had enron and some of the other problems weve had there
5522026 the government had developed bad habits over the years in the way it dealt with telstra and telstra had developed bad habits in the way it dealt with the government
5522027 in fact telstra was making most of its decisions in relation to what the regulator wanted not in relation to what the customer wanted so we changed that
5522028 even building materials went up in the past year steel wood everything we need to keep a county going has gone up this past year so we have to make adjustments where we can and keep moving forward
5522029 project dealing with the bakken is how you fracture stimulate the bakken wells and what makes the wells work the education programs are more about the impacts of the industry positive and negative
5522030 the return to the state is phenomenal weve seen it in jobs tax revenues economic activities royalties its really driving the economy in nd right now unlike most states
5522031 this website will help them learn to not hurt themselves and their friends and families with the second hand smoke that they create
5522032 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5522033 this is a planning took where all things are going
5522034 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5522035 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5522036 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5522037 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5522038 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5522039 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5522040 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5522041 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5522042 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5522043 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5522044 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5522045 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5522046 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5522047 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5522048 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5522049 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5522050 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5522051 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5522052 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5522053 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5522054 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5522055 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5522056 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5522057 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5522058 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5522059 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5522060 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5522061 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5522062 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5522063 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5522064 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5522065 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5522066 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5522067 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5522068 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5522069 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5522070 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5522071 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5522072 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5522073 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5522074 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5522075 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5522076 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5522077 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection

5522080 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus

5522085 an appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile hoping it will eat him last
5522086 if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization it expects what never was and never will be
5522087 the day that this country ceases to be free for irreligion it will cease to be free for religion except for the sect that can win political power
5522088 a government that is big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away
5522089 on two occasions i have been asked pray mr babbage if you put into the machine wrong figures will the right answers come out i am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question

5522092 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce

5522095 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5522096 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5522097 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5522098 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5522099 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5522100 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5522101 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5522102 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5522103 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5522104 irans position which was first expressed by the imam khomeini and stated several times by those responsible is that the cancerous tumor called israel must be uprooted from the region
5522105 this regime thanks to god has lost the reason for its existence efforts to stabilize this fake israeli regime by the grace of god have completely failed you should believe that this regime is disappearing

5522108 i will continue the tradition established by menachem begin who did not allow iraq to develop such a nuclear threat against israel and by a daring and courageous act gave us two decades of tranquility
5522109 i believe that this is what israel has to do

5522111 we officially passed final cert on our first try friday august 15th
5522112 it appears we have an average education system where many children are not doing well and where more than half of maori boys are leaving school with not even a basic qualification
5522113 when you look at reading scores for 10 year old children in decile 10 schools in leafier suburbs their reading comprehension is nearly a year above their chronological age but in decile 1 schools in poverty areas where there are many maori children their comprehension is nearly two years below their chronological age
5522114 we have to want maori children to match the achievement of decile 10 the top echelon
5522115 im pretty sure the director would not approve an exception
5522116 just do your job lady its not going to kill you

5522126 the growers and handlers of california almonds have set the stage for this unprecedented growth with forward thinking strategically sound programs administered by the almond board of california from the research in the field aimed at creating a more sustainable environment for growing almonds to the investment in research to understand almond nutritional benefits the entire almond community has been focused on making record crops and record demand a reality
5522127 in fact almonds continue to be the second most frequently used nut worldwide for new nut product introductions and if demand continues to grow at this rate almonds will become the number one nut for global new product introductions in 2008

5522129 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5522130 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5522131 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success

5522136 our experience is that sharing waters are more commonly a point of cooperation rather than conflict and we will continue to work in this area given the increasing demand for water
5522137 this essential treaty has been stalled for more than a decade largely due to the failure of nations in not signing up to what they long ago agreed to
5522138 most of the worlds trans boundary river basins lack adequate legal protection and the world needs a global framework for sustainably managing and preventing disputes over those resources this is the only such framework available in the timescale to help us deal with a growing water crisis
5522139 take ethiopia and egypt which have negotiated trade agreements following the nile basin initiative
5522140 now some of the poorest countries in africa which border the river nile cooperate on managing the water resources in turn contributing to peace and stability economic growth and tackling climate change this is a result of recognising a common not conflicting resource
5522141 the experts are telling us that rivalries over water will be a significant source of future conflict as indeed they already are

5522189 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5522190 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5522191 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about
5522192 theyre great at drama but there are many nuances that can be left out without getting the reality from the troops themselves

5522209 wahai orang orang yang beriman diwajibkan atas kalian berpuasa sebagaimana diwajibkan atas orang orang sebelum kalian agar kalian bertakwa
5522210 nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam pernah mengutus seseorang pada pagi hari asyura ke kampung kampung anshar untuk memerintahkan barangsiapa yang pagi hari itu dalam keadaan tidak berpuasa hendaknya dia sempurnakan hari itu dengan puasa dan barangsiapa yang pagi itu berpuasa hendaknya melanjutkan puasanya

5522214 apabila dia masih kecil dan belum baligh maka tidak diharuskan puasa akan tetapi jika dia mampu dan tidak merasa berat maka dia diperintahkan untuk berpuasa dahulu para shahabat menyuruh anak anak mereka berpuasa sampai sampai jika ada di antara anak anak itu menangis mereka memberikan mainan untuk membuat mereka lupa namun jika memang hal ini benar benar membahayakan maka orang tua boleh melarangnya karena allah subhanahu wa taala melarang kita memberikan harta milik anak anak kepada mereka karena khawatir akan rusaknya harta tersebut maka tentunya kekhawatiran akan bahaya yang menimpa badan lebih utama untuk dicegah akan tetapi larangan tersebut bukan dengan cara yang keras karena hal ini tidaklah layak dilakukan terhadap anak anak pada saat mendidik mereka

5522218 at this point we have no relationship and i dont see that changing
5522219 its just gotten to a point where i think lines were crossed if you ask me coaches should be coaches management should be management and i dont think those lines should be crossed but when you cross those lines you put yourself in postiion for things like this to happen

5522225 part of that was a shift from coal to oil and gas and part was a move to burn coal at higher temperatures and burn it in a better way
5522226 theres been very little study of thallium in the arctic though
5522227 rock n roll in the future will be the industry of cool
5522228 its been the last three world championships that way im very disappointed with that consistently
5522229 same country i think different judge i dont want to go any further with that
5522230 you want to go and ask her no idea theres not a single gymnast in the final over there
5522231 im a little disappointed you know i tied it wasnt that i got second by three or five tenths i had the same exact score and thats what makes it a little bit harder to take
5522232 you do your performance and you end and then you turn it over to someone elses hands weve gotten used to that and we just have to accept that
5522233 nothing against anyone from australia i dont want to start anything thats not my place to judge im just kind of stating the facts
5522234 if they cheat shame of them but we have no proof
5522235 did not review the articles at issue prior to their publication and did not forward or otherwise circulate the articles to any other person

5522237 the good news is a lot of these technology companies are strong secular growers
5522238 they can grow at a nice rate even in a weakening economy
5522239 im not so sure weve found a bottom quite yet
5522240 theres a high likelihood that electronic arts ups its bid and a deal is made

5522244 this is a well known company that is growing at much greater rates than the market

5522249 without a supreme court without human rights organizations and without all sorts of bleeding heart liberals
5522250 i bought hook line and sinker into this as i helped write the party platform the only guarantor of israeli peace and security is the opening of arab society
5522251 the real solution to this kind of problem is not going to be resolved by handing back this territory or that territory it can only be resolved by reaching the position where two societies learn to live with each other and accept each others right to exist and thats only going to happen when arab society becomes open free and democratic with rights for religious and sexual minorities
5522252 israeli society is not at the point yet where it can look at the palestinians the arabs and desire friendship and a relationship
5522253 israeli society does get up every morning and reach for that kind of relationship i dont want to be misconstrued and say that israeli society is racist and we all hate arabs but liberal multicultural love for the other should be the basis of relations with our neighbors and that is something we have to work towards
5522254 being rid of all the baggage he carries as the terrorist father of violent palestinian struggle for independence
5522255 were talking about the possible lebanization of at least gaza if not all the palestinian administered territory im not sure how long its going to last but its not going to be a short time
5522256 there was a resentment of the israeli presence in the territories so theyd throw rocks at us they wanted us out of their lives im not passing judgment theyd throw the rocks wed shoot rubber bullets above their heads theyd run away wed come back
5522257 now they have guns and rockets and they want to kill us
5522258 my question was the reason our founding fathers fought for free speech really so tiny little thugs who call themselves
5522259 we will continue to relentlessly pursue those individuals who choose to trade access download and publish online child abuse images and child exploitation material
5522260 and if you are one of those people know that police could be knocking on your door tomorrow
5522261 my customers who are primarily baby boomers are changing where they go for information more of them are using the web to get information so i need to change my advertising
5522262 however a number of prison officers have been working too much overtime and this has become an occupational health and safety issue
5522263 the department believes it is important that there is a balance between work and time away from the demands of the job and we want officers to have more quality time at home
5522264 of course prison officers will continue to earn overtime that is part of the 24 hour job of supervising and managing the states 32 correctional centres but excessive overtime will be stamped out

5522275 hes into football plays safety and running back he plays a little baseball too
5522276 right now my goal is to help the white sox win
5522277 and 1995 i had a lot of great teammates who are still friends

5522280 already there are advocates saying that injection sites are not enough that government should hand out heroin for free
5522281 others are now calling for inhalation rooms for people who smoke their drugs while i support various aspects of harm reduction i believe that we have to draw the line somewhere with regard to these kinds of measures
5522282 is it ethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5522283 in this way the supervised injection site undercuts the ethics of medical practice and sets a debilitating example for all physicians and nurses both present and future in canada who might begin to question whether its ok to allow someone to overdose under their care
5522284 we specifically take issue with the minister using that phrase
5522285 the minister was off base in calling into question the ethics of physicians involved in harm reduction
5522286 its clear that this was being used as a political issue
5522287 i found the use of medical ethics to justify a political decision which will affect social policy to be troubling at best and misleading at worst
5522288 ethics consist of a balancing of rights and harms as do all medical decisions that physicians in this room help their patients reach every day iv drug users as the rest of us have the right to compassion and to access and care which has proven to be beneficial
5522289 there is not enough evidence for who to provide global guidance to member states on safe injection facilities
5522290 we have to do more to reach out to our own sons and daughters who are overdosing in the downtown eastside
5522291 they need our compassion and they need our intervention not help simply to shoot up
5522292 we know that if people have a safe place that they can talk to people that they eventually will come off drugs they eventually will get help and that they dont die
5522293 she fit right in those are the words of this defendant
5522294 shes simply trying to put the pieces of the evening together
5522295 people are frustrated and apprehensive and are saying what can we do to make it right
5522296 it is up to us the four nations people we need to work together to come up with a long term solutions against the gangs the drugs and the violence but our community has to take charge
5522297 these communities have to recognize that they have a problem with some of these young people that are out there with their gang ties and this lifestyle with drugs and the violence and they can go home to grandma and grandma will accept them and love them unconditionally kamins said
5522298 well the grandmas and other community leaders have to stop and say wait a minute
5522299 the hardened criminals and the entrenched gang members are committing these crimes and they are committing violence and they are hurting the community terribly
5522300 we have to balance that on the other hand with the fact that we have a lot of people involved in gangs who may be rehabilitated
5522301 the productivity wasnt there for the offence so you can never sit and say the quarterback played well when that doesnt happen
5522302 there are some decisions im sure well look at and well learn from based on once again the whole offence it was not a good evening for any of our quarterbacks
5522303 by no means do we think this was going to be easy for any of the quarterbacks theyre young experience is not on their side they need to play games
5522304 this conflict is very much about proving who is the bad guy

5522309 its not going to happen if youre coming for that youll be disappointed
5522310 it has become extraordinarily difficult to write libraries that run as fast as possible
5522311 particularly affected are numerical applications those that require extensive mathematics such as any form of audio image video processing communication medical imaging scientific modeling and many others
5522312 puts performance optimization into the realm of guru programmers who do things like restructure the computation to avoid cache misses use special vector instructions and parallelize for multiple processor cores
5522313 this may mark the first time that commercial library development is done by a computer
5522314 the analytical engine has no pretensions to originate anything it can do whatever we know how to order it to perform
5522315 this does not imply that it may not be possible to construct electronic equipment which will think for itself or in which in biological terms one could set up a conditioned reflex which would serve as a basis for learning whether this is possible in principle or not is a stimulating and exciting question suggested by some of these recent developments but it did not seem that the machines constructed or projected at the time had this property

5522322 im better than you because the country i happen to be born in had other people born in who ive never met interacted with or seen other than in the newspaper or on the internet once or twice happen to have done a little better in an international sporting event than someone in your country
5522323 see the games as between athletes not countries nonetheless placed list countries in a order based on gold number too the ranking system used by most us media outlets to me is an unnecesary show of lack of confidence
5522324 solid state disks replacing disk drives is something i talked to andy grove and gordon moore at intel in 1981 27 years ago we could do that in semiconductors im just very lucky this was my phd thesis in radiation effects in space the physics was the same it just happened
5522325 flash at least for the next several years is incapable of replacing a big part of disk drives it will complement disk drives and in some markets it will replace disk drives because disk drives are so cost effective in desktop and applications i think the mobile space is where well make a big play and eventually the world will be mobile 10 years from now

5522367 legion of super heroes at 50 what makes the legion cool
5522368 my favorite superhero stories are the ones that on the surface appear to be a fun big superhero story but underneath are really about us
5522369 our struggles with faith loss finding inspiration overcoming our fears striving to be the best we can be thats really what legion of 3 worlds is about among many other things
5522370 and in smallville weve got an element of embracing your destiny or questioning those that tell you who youre supposed to be theres many more in the episode im working on
5522371 i think the size of the group has everything to do with it the cast is so huge and so sprawling that theres somebody there for everybody
5522372 and you get that great sort of feeling of im a fan of this one character that nobody else likes but thats ok thats my special attachment to shrinking violet or timberwolf or whatever its like when you find this band that nobody else knows is cool yet you get that sense that i know something that nobody else gets and i think thats a big part of the legions appeal
5522373 i think this version of the future has lasted so long because the legion was one of the only ongoing science fiction series that put forward a positive future that made it stand out
5522374 there were threats and all that came roaring in but for the most part it was flight rings and snazzy headquarters and a fun future the legion is the idea that the science we have now did what it was supposed to do and made our lives better it was a pretty utopian future all the different planets were getting along and you never really saw ghettos or any of the dystopian things that a lot of the futures deal with
5522375 the primary audience back then was young people and here you had a future through the eyes of young people
5522376 if youre a kid whats cooler than a club of superhero kids they had their own clubhouse and everything
5522377 the legion has survived because its a thoroughly appealing future
5522378 and its deeply tied to the very core of the dc universe lets remember its been made over several times but even the most extreme makeovers have retained the basic essence of the legion its a future that pulses with nostalgia for all of us this is a feature weve all grown up with whichever version of it were nostalgic about
5522379 we had stayed here before and it was always real quiet peaceful never any trouble of course until the ceiling falls on your head
5522380 a wonderful system for general information dates times locations user friendly for searching data entry
5522381 couldnt see same records county had they couldnt see our records
5522382 we know what theyre doing they know what were doing
5522383 if it was a county arrest the county would have had that information and you wouldnt have had that information
5522384 before on the separate system we would enter them in our system for three or four thefts the city would have three or four thefts but neither of us would know about them
5522385 now instead of taking time to go hunt someone down a city officer can just pull it up on the computer
5522386 the mindset before was to wait them out but when we start seeing these shootings across the nation the longer law enforcement waits the more people get injured
5522387 if the situation were true at least we know what to do what to take care of with the kids and the sitution how to protect ourselves
5522388 i think one of the best things is to stick to a policy and everybody follow through on a plan and everybody know whats going on
5522389 we need to make sure we do everything we can to make sure our school is safe that our students are safe and our teachers need to know what they need to do in case of an emergency situation
5522390 i cant say for sure which bits came into christianity from earlier religions an enormous amount did i should find it hard to believe christianity if that were not so
5522391 almost total sceptic s about history i had expected such a person would disbelieve the gospels because they contain miracles but he really disbelieves them because the gospels deal with things that happened 2000 years ago he would disbelieve equally in the battle of actium if he heard of it
5522392 the uneducated englishman has a distrust very rational in the state of his knowledge of ancient texts thus a man has sometimes said to me these records were written in the days before printing werent they and you havent got the original bit of paper have you so what it comse to is that someone wrote something and someone else copied it well by the time it comes to us it wont be in the least like the original this is a difficult objection to deal with because one cannot there and then start teaching the whole science of textual criticism
5522393 the major things everyone wants to know is how much will i have to pay for healthcare and will i get a raise
5522394 millions have been put forth for healthcare and wages and that tells me theyre probably gonna give us a raise and have a good health care plan
5522395 im glad there was no strike because a strike just prolongs things
5522396 3 million to study the dna of bears in montana

5522398 we are not operating in any way which may counter israeli interests we have turned down many requests involving arms sales to georgia and the ones which have been approves have been duly scrutinized so far we have placed no limitations on the sale of protective measures
5522399 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
5522400 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
5522401 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
5522402 it was clear that too many unmistakable israeli systems in the possesion of the georgian army would be like a red cloth in the face of a raging bull as far as russia is concerned
5522403 and that the interception of three of these rpvs in the past three months was an expression of this anger not everyone in israel understood the sensitive nerve israel touched when it supplied such an advanced arms system to a country whose relations with russia are highly tense
5522404 we conducted a small job for them several years ago
5522405 the israeli is the main investor in the georgian economy everyone is there directly or indirectly
5522406 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
5522407 we are now in a fight against the great russia
5522408 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own
5522409 its important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
5522410 we need help from the un and from our friends headed by the united states and israel today georgia is in danger tomorrow all the democratic countries in the region and in the entire world will be in danger too

5522479 we have many misgivings about the way the hospital handled the case
5522480 in my opinion they were negligent in the speed with which they pronounced my daughters death it is curious how a 600 gram child who is the size of the palm of my hand comes back to life by herself
5522481 when i came to the morgue to collect her her body was wrapped up
5522482 then my wife out of an inexplicable impulse asked to see her again at first i didnt want to break her heart but then i went up when i got there she realized she was moving

5522495 he was a hunter hes carried a rifle its quite possible that someone or people doing a development might come across a rifle or his remains
5522496 that case is interesting they are not sure if hes missing or if he went overseas maybe he came back from hunting and went overseas it wasnt odd way back then when you didnt have things like credit cards that can be tracked as easily

5522502 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5522503 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5522504 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5522505 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5522557 toen ik 30 jaar geleden van een paragnost te horen kreeg dat ik de re ncarnatie van koos speenhoff was wuifde ik dat lachend weg ik kende de goede man amper en nu kruip ik in de huid van deze oer hollandse dichter zanger als koos speel ik gitaar goed gestemd n piano want hij heeft niet stil gezeten in de tijd dat hij niet hier was daardoor krijgen zijn liedjes meer variatie en in enkele vertolkingen herken je z een jongere generatie zangers cabaretiers als hans de booij drs p herman van veen en hans dorrestijn
5522558 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5522559 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5522560 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5522561 cnn contacted me about this whole thing theyre doing for the election trying to encourage people to vote and they told us they were approaching chris for the project
5522562 im a big fan of his hes got a great voice and i thought it would be a really good idea so i just gave my blessing to the project and they took it from there
5522563 i think people have come to realize what a big mistake the last time theyd voted was it might have been anyway there are two very viable candidates as far as im concerned and there is one who will be a revolutionary candidate in a way and change the direction of america and i think the more people that get out there to vote thats extremely important
5522564 its a song that requires a really strong voice to carry it off and hes got the range and the power to really do it convincingly
5522565 i dont think there are that many singers around at the moment that could really nail it out of all the singers of that style hes the strongest hes just a great singer all around it doesnt matter what style it is he could pretty much sing anything
5522566 i think its not too far away from the original
5522567 theyve modernized it a bit brought it up to todays standards with the sound and arrangement too when i heard it it made me think back to when we recorded the original it was pretty exciting at the time and i sort of got the same feeling when i heard chris version
5522568 his skills really get magnified when surrounded by great players like this

5522575 the cw and our studio partner cbs paramount network television have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere

5522577 there are a lot of people out there who pretend to have all the answers if i could make them feel the way i feel during the lowest of my lows for one week just one week that would be the sweetest revenge i could ever imagine because there are a lot of people out there who think im just crying victim here that im weak i didnt have the fortitude to bounce back and get my second wind in life because i wasnt strong enough to deal with the disappointments the shortcomings the setbacks the bad breaks i mean what do they honestly think that this shit is just a figment of my imagination that its just a mild case of the blahhs were all looking for the perfect respite to the monotonous life but it becomes more difficult as we slightly age and lose that twinkle in our eyes no matter how much we attempt to block out any semblence of reality why go through life dissastisfied and complacent why keep sighing into our martinis late into the night and becoming copies of the people next to us why turn to music to express our suppressed feelings and thoughts and emotions when we really should be turning to each other and why at this point even attempt to create a story of friendship and hope amid such a dismal tableau

5522673 i would support a lifting of the moratorium for purposes of exploration before we allow drilling to begin wholesale off the east coast we need to have some exploration to determine what is there and if its worth our pursuing it further recognizing there may be some environmental consequences exploration is a good thing
5522674 the federal moratorium is a federal policy based on a cost benefit calculation that the cost of offshore drilling currently outweighs the benefits they havent changed that this bill as drafted said no the benefits outweigh the costs before we make that determination we need to make sure that thats really the case
5522675 i think the governor supports the approach obama has taken which is essentially a comprehensive plan that looks at the possibility of drilling for oil
5522676 but obama has strong support for states making individual decisions on that so i wouldnt say those two things are in conflict hes not advocating drill here drill now as the only approach
5522677 i would like that there be no death penalty in virginia absolutely
5522678 he has presided over executions as governor explaining that as a lawyer he accepts even laws that go against his personal faith but he has also vetoed five death penalty expansion bills since becoming governor and in june of this year he commuted the death sentence of percy levar walton a virginian convicted and sentenced to death for three murders to life in prison without parole testing showed that walton had an i q of 66 and may have lacked the cognitive skills to understand his crime and the punishment he faced but that subtlety is unlikely to be highlighted in republican attack ads
5522679 i think that people who want to take this within 24 hours of the event and make it their political hobby horse to ride ive got nothing but loathing for them

5522685 hell i guarantee the content co opters at abel to yzerman were about to link this article under the heading
5522686 i realize its the slow summer season but can this guy tone down the tough guy histrionics his posts are fatiguing on an otherwise excellent site
5522687 i constantly marvel at how bill iwocpo and his disciples at abel to yzerman can be so pompous and full of themselves throughout every regular season but come playoff time they collapse into wavering puddles of stress and nervousness as they anxiously await the impending and unavoidable collapse of the red wings in the post season
5522688 its just a shame that the most classless uneducated lowbrow fanbase in the league gets this sweep red wing fans dont deserve their team

5522747 this isnt a hurricane if the media wasnt down here hyping this up this would be a non event
5522748 they should continue to stay calm and be smart and make sure they exercise common sense
5522749 youre only 17 you dont know what youre talking about
5522750 on 30 9 2006 at about 6 00 to 6 30 a m acused jagdish mandlekar came to my shop to drink tea he demanded tea on credit i told him that i do not give credit at morning hours he told me that he burnt his clothes in which rs 150 was there which were also burnt i asked him why he burnt his clothes he told me that on earlier day i e on 29th he killed 4 members of family of bhaiyalal bhotmange and his clothes were stained with blood and therefore he burnt same clothes at that time gopichand mohature was present there i did not give tea to him
5522751 extra judicial confession can form the basis of conviction if the person before whom it is stated be made to appear to be unbiased and are not even remotely inimical to the accused
5522752 after my arrest i told about incident of say of jagdish mandlekar to police officer shri bharne as well as on my first production before court i told to magistrate about the incident of say of jagdish mandlekar but none paid attention to it after my release on bail i came to know that police recorded the statement of my brother anil lede it is not true to say that my father being physically handicapped person he opens shop at morning witness volunteers that either he or his brother opens shop at morning i have close relations with jagdish mandlekar it it true to say say that accused jagdish mandlekar is not my close friend
5522753 it is not true to say that i made false statement to judicial magistrate under the pressure of cbi
5522754 on which control of our reality and this planet is being contested
5522755 before he will be considered a suitable mate in short this kind of compulsion obsession is
5522756 if you kill a snake youre still afraid of it
5522757 i think we need to give the police more power to stop crime
5522758 i need to take viagra so i can be a proper man
5522759 appreciating spatial perceptions depends more on the right hemisphere although there is a left hemisphere contribution this is especially true when handling objects
5522760 how far does the employer go before infringing on the employees rights for example women that wear no panties is that permissible or not
5522761 as a member of the australian olympic team he is entitled to stay at the athletes village
5522762 we have allowed andy to go on loan to bristol city until the january transfer window
5522763 we feel it will be beneficial for him to get first team football there and we hope he can return to the level we all know he is capable of
5522764 young drinkers who have greater disposable incomes are much more likely to drink to excess
5522765 this shows the scale of the challenge were facing and highlights why urgent action is needed to tackle binge drinking
5522766 we work very closely with the military particularly along the border region and we would hope and expect that that would continue
5522767 resolving the whither musharraf question may well allow the government in pakistan to now focus on issues of even greater urgency and immediacy like what is happening in the tribal areas
5522768 the new pakistani government may or may not prove to be as reliable of an ally in the global war on terror as president musharraf has been only time will tell
5522769 the war against extremism is bigger than any one person
5522770 whats important here is that we work with pakistan to do what we can to root out these extremists and prevent them from crossing the border in afghanistan and carrying out attacks and from attacking targets within pakistan
5522771 im proud of the growth weve seen in our first year with a remarkable number of visitors registering as users early tests of this new site design show a double digit growth in that conversion rate helping us meet our goal of getting 1 million americans on track to meet their financial goals by 2010
5522772 we dont want to be in a situation where we are in some kind of frozen relationship
5522773 but until russia pulls its forces out of georgia and respects international norms of the 21st century we just cant go on with business as usual
5522774 if these decisions are in fact taken on behalf of the georgian aggressor we will not be able to maintain the quality and the schedule of our relationship with nato
5522775 we have a serious temptation to bring all our potential cooperation with nato under question
5522776 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5522777 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5522778 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the second half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5522779 i had lots of pitches working the off speed was good and so was the fastball
5522780 i had a couple good ones into lefties it was one of my better ones the last two starts were weird after i lost aggressiveness a little bit but today i was happy to get out of the trouble when i was able to focus better
5522781 its been a frustrating month and a half all around not playing good baseball
5522782 i made a huge mental mistake today i thought the count was 2 2 stuff like that has been going on all year
5522783 i just told them this could be your last at bat as a team
5522784 after merrell hit the home run i thought we were in good shape
5522785 i knew it was gone because i hit it long
5522786 besides shave the beard put a uniform on and see if i can throw a curveball or two
5522787 it was by far the longest home run i have ever hit
5522788 you know yall were like let me get four tickets to the funeral hes still the hottest ticket in town
5522789 bernie always said that he walked alone i dont think that he was alone i think he was walking with jesus ill see you soon bernie
5522790 five years ago when we were first starting out wed autograph shirts and say start your own band about books
5522791 we just wanted to present a different idea of what a band could be
5522792 we wanted to play music that you wouldnt normally see on the tv or the radio
5522793 we werent thinking we would create a wizard rock movement it just evolved
5522794 but its cool to see bands about books realized in some way
5522795 some people dont like twilight potentially becoming the new harry potter theres a lot of groaning and moaning about the movie coming out and the fact that there is twilight music kind of bothers some people
5522796 twilight is sort of like the hannah montana of literature
5522797 if youre outside the 14 to 16 year old age range you might listen to it and it might get stuck in your head but its not good literature its not really enriching your life the way harry potter might
5522798 love is never going to get old and if you can find new ways to talk about love you can find new ways to write about twilight but i dont think twilight is as powerful as harry potter is twilight is about love and being a teenager and wondering if you fit in and harry potter is that and so much more
5522799 for us its a community not so much a genre of music and i dont know if they have a community yet if they all get together if the bands are as close as all of us are
5522800 i dont think it could have a movement on its own
5522801 but wizard rock can expand to be bands themed about other books it doesnt just have to be about harry potter anyone who is singing about any book can be part of wizard rock
5522802 struggle with stage fright and sensitivities about appearing too forward pushy or intrusive
5522803 i am in a working situation where men are paid more than women only because they are men eventhough they have less qualification and technical ability
5522804 but i couldnt continue assigning idiotic books that are starting to break 200
5522805 what makes us rich as a society is what we know and what we can do
5522806 anything that stands in the way of the dissemination of knowledge is a real problem
5522807 as for the prizes he advocates i think theyre privately funded
5522808 at present one man is confirmed dead at the scene and another two people have been seriously injured
5522809 a further 44 walking wounded patients have been taken to the medical centre at alton towers and are being treated by medical staff and doctors
5522810 excused from such performance from and after july 4 2008 pursuant to california labor code sec 2855 a
5522811 may not be enforced against the employee beyond seven years from the commencement of service under it
5522812 emis relationship with 30 seconds to mars has been extremely rewarding and successful for both the band and the company
5522813 the hard work of emis global team and of the band has resulted in sales of 3 million albums and singles multiple awards and a growing global fanbase however we have been forced to take procedural legal steps in order to protect emis investment and rights during contract renegotiations initiated by the band and management we hope to resolve these matters amicably and put them behind us so we can continue working in partnership with the band to take them to even greater levels of success
5522814 we had been signed to our record contract for nine years
5522815 basically under california law where we live and signed our deal one cannot be bound to a contract for more than seven years this is widely known by all the record companies and has been for years in fact so aware of it are they that they desperately try to make deals outside of california whenever possible it is a law that protects people from lengthy unfair career spanning contracts this law also gave us the legal right to explore other possible opportunities
5522816 we have been sued by the corporation quite simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void
5522817 we terminated for a number of reasons which we wont go into here
5522818 the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt
5522819 so we have lost many of the people that were near and dear to us at virgin emi and crucial to the success of 30 seconds to mars a few of the great ones are still there but it is hardly the same company we have known
5522820 we cant wait for this guy to join the party
5522821 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
5522822 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
5522823 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
5522824 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
5522825 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
5522826 kami sendiri sebenarnya tidak mau terlalu menanggapi dengan pernyataan pak awang tapi masyarakat pasti sudah mengarahkan ke kami karena yang masuk putaran kedua adalah ahad karena itulah pak awang sebagai orang yang berjiwa besar seharusnya tidak sembarangan menuduh apalagi sampai menyebut ada yang ingin menjegalnya sebagai dalam pencalonan gubernur kaltim
5522827 saya kira kejagung adalah lembaga independen tidak sembarangan dalam mengungkap kasus tentu ini sudah melalui proses yang panjang apalagi saya dengar ini sudah setahun dilakukan pemeriksaan saya kira biar saja hukum yang membuktikannya
5522828 itu politis saya melihat ada kaitannya dengan putaran kedua pilgub putaran kedua red

5522833 memang saya mengagunkan sebagian aset saya ini saya lakukan semata mata membantu teman teman anggota dewan yang belum bisa mengembalikan uang yang mereka terima sementara mereka tidak punya aset yang bisa dijaminkan
5522834 saya akhirnya berinisiatif untuk mengagunkan aset saya ini supaya mereka mendapat kredit untuk mengembalikan dana bansos yang terlanjur mereka terima itu
5522835 siapa yang mau dibantu saya bantu tapi bagi mereka yang tak mau mengembalikan uang itu silakan tanggung sendiri akibatnya
5522836 because of the lack of aggravating factors your guilty plea and previous good character today we are going to deal with this matter by way of a fine
5522837 because of the lack of gt aggravating factors your guilty plea and previous good character gt today we are going to deal with this matter by way of a fine
5522838 theres other names up there that are just astounding some of our favorite artists and politicians
5522839 but its going to be really cool to see that in 10 years 20 years from now
5522840 a lot of kids feel lonely when they first get diagnosed with diabetes im just so encouraged at the end of the day because all im trying to do is make it through another day managing diabetes
5522841 theyre just doing the same thing were all there for each other
5522842 we run around onstage constantly for about an hour and 45 minutes and we know what that can do you just feel great at the end of the night and when you wake up in the morning
5522843 so youll see a difference in vocals a little bit more personality and its definitely a sensual album
5522844 i definitely think that when i first heard the song from the beginning of the record you kind of feel like you know im leaving it up to you
5522845 and by the time it gets to the second verse and makes it to the end of the song it just feels like im saying i dont want to put up with it anymore
5522846 it was a great first single for me because it said something i fell in love with records like beyonc s irreplaceable where you could emotionally attach yourself to the record as soon as you heard it
5522847 i didnt want something so vague and so clubby because i wanted people to see me as a woman with something to say
5522848 i would say that an official girl is someone in a relationship
5522849 youre attentive youre honest but at the same time you can let go a little bit

5522862 every day we see patients who have dental anxieties fears and phobias
5522863 these fears can have a devastating effect since postponements in receiving dental care can impact a persons self confidence appearance and well being left untreated dental problems can have far reaching consequences seriously affecting patient health
5522864 sedation should be the last resort not the first course of action
5522865 its a quick remedy that may address the symptoms of anxiety but not the underlying cause
5522866 dental anxiety is basically the fear of the unknown and can usually be handled by taking the time to familiarize a patient with the office the equipment and the procedures
5522867 dental fear elicits more of a fight or flight response and typically can be stopped by giving patients more control over their experience dental phobia can be tougher to overcome but the same desensitization techniques used to treat other phobias also work well with dental phobia
5522868 i started by showing her all of the instruments we would be using and honestly explaining every nuance of the procedure
5522869 then she went back in the waiting room until her fear subsided she then came back in and allowed me to do an examination and then went back out to the waiting room we repeated the process over the course of several hours but eventually she received treatment that same day with no sedation
5522870 unfortunately many people have had humiliating or negative experiences with other dentists or have picked up on a parents dental anxiety
5522871 uncovering the root of the problem enables us to develop valuable strategies that will lead to successful treatment
5522872 for some people headphones and a soft blanket will do the trick while others might need to touch the instruments
5522873 if we can eliminate the anxiety fear or phobia it will not only improve a persons dental health but their general well being
5522874 retractors drills burs probes and excavators that sounds more like a construction zone then a place to maintain healthy teeth

5522877 i have seen him many times on television and in the newspapers
5522878 i am so happy to see him in person and i will vote for him on aug 26
5522879 i wanted to call off the walk about because of the rain but i thought of the people who were waiting for me here i did not want to disappoint them
5522880 i think i have put on weight i hope my sugar level is under control anyway azizah is keeping an eye on my diet

5522883 it is the private property of my family and it was confiscated due to some illegal rules
5522884 it was a plunder plunder because it was seizure without compensation it was robbery
5522885 todays warsaw is a communist state a socialist one where 90 of the land is state property theres not such a case in the whole of europe
5522886 the belief is that the compensation will go to the jews which much of polish opinion doesnt want the anti semitic motivation is strong enough to paint the whole issue as a jewish extortion from the polish state
5522887 of course its a shame that for 18 years poland wasnt able to tackle this problem
5522888 it would have been much easier at the beginning of the 1990s when the state took over all the lands the buildings back then we should have given it back to the people now its a little too late those people deserve to be compensated
5522889 the heroes series has brought some of the worlds most exciting air battles in history to gamers all over the world and heroes over europe builds on the series impressive legacy with highly detailed realistic visual presentation and an even deeper online experience
5522890 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5522891 a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated
5522892 level of objectivity has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5522893 with all due respect to the campaign leadership they are viewing our coverage through a political prism
5522894 we stand by our reporting our journalism and our journalists
5522895 por orden de ch vez se intervinieron dos emisoras de r
5522896 por orden de ch vez se intervinieron dos emisoras de radio
5522897 se tomaron dos emisoras opuestas a la candidatura de william lara una de ellas de corte musical llanero y la otra llamada rumbera
5522898 tomaron estas emisoras sin una orden jur dica amenazaron con intervenir a diferentes organismos sin ning n mecanismo esto una acci n pol tica por eso quiero denunciar la intervenci n de estas emisoras que simplemente no se prestaron para la campa a de lara
5522899 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
5522900 esa medida es para construir m s viviendas o para decir qui n construye o qui n no construye
5522901 4 hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one 5 you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might 6 and these words that i command you today shall be on your heart 7 you shall teach them diligently to your children and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise 8 you shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes 9 you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates
5522902 if you didnt think that a pastor has any business being the first to interview two presidential candidates in his church youll be even more alarmed that saakashvili was apparently on the phone with warren yesterday and he relayed this information on sean hannitys radio show yes we need much more religion in politics dont we the secularism is suffocating
5522903 placed its whole case for murder on a 16 year old who had consumed 80 ounces of malt liquor who had a view from a darkened park across a darkened roadway
5522904 is that it were going to hang him on that
5522905 isnt it a little late for you to be out
5522906 we made up a plan that we were going to tell the cops that nobody kicked him that there were no racial slurs there was no booze and brian got hit first
5522907 does exactly what mr ramirez was doing he throws a punch
5522908 its been a really hard day for me and im just really happy that the charges stuck
5522909 every sustained one cent increase in fuel prices takes 1 7 billion a year out of u s consumers pockets for other spending
5522910 these are sales lost to non fuel retailers restaurants auto dealers and other businesses due to the increase in fuel prices
5522911 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5522912 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5522913 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5522914 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5522915 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5522916 myspace is committed to keeping all users as safe and secure as possible today myspace was alerted to an issue within the myspace mobile wap site and is working to roll out an immediate fix
5522917 if the applications you refer to show the basic information that is already available publicly there is not a violation that said were looking into this
5522918 if the average citizen is worried about people spying never add anyone even a friend without telephone or e mail confirmation that it is legitimate
5522919 the willingness to put young people and their families in jeopardy thats what brought us to the conclusion to release the picture
5522920 its amazing how helpful field interviews are in solving serious crimes
5522921 sometimes officers say let me see your tattoos theyre kind of proud to show them to you which ultimately in some cases works against them in the end
5522922 muxtape will be unavailable for a brief period while we sort out a problem with the riaa
5522923 its probably the best game for me now i cant see if anyone bowls too fast for me
5522924 im interested in telling the story of what kind of person succeeds in the u s and it is the outsider it is someone who is unattached that we value to succeed in the u s one of the deals is you will have to become a white man and what that means is you will have to give something huge up which weve all done willingly and that is very painful and that is the story you can reinvent yourself it will be tolerated but you are losing something that you dont think you value but its going to hurt you because you cant escape yourself
5522925 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
5522926 obama started to say that justice thomas didnt have enough experience for the supreme court
5522927 this is all reminiscent of senate majority leader harry reids comment several years ago that justice thomas was an embarrassment to the court and that his opinions were poorly written
5522928 reasonable supreme court observers of all political stripes who do not necessarily agree with justice thomas jurisprudence consider his work to be scholarly and of top quality and yet senator obama is sadly unable to acknowledge even that much about an intelligent wonderful and kind man who broke racial barriers to rise to the very top of the legal profession
5522929 apparently obama can do no better than to recycle discredited statements of harry reid when it comes to justice thomas like other liberal elites obama cannot stand it when a black man strays from the ideological plantation and refuses to implement liberal policies through the courts but obama will never point out any intellectual deficiencies in justice thomass work because he cant justice thomass opinions consistently reveal faithfulness to the constitution judicial modesty and deference to the will of the people in our representative democracy that is opposed to everything that obama and the liberals are trying to do in grabbing power from the people and giving it to the courts
5522930 its precisely because justice thomas has proven himself such a faithful steward of the constitution that barack obama says he wouldnt have nominated him
5522931 if he is elected obama is a sure bet to appoint liberal judicial activists eager to invent farfetched constitutional rights that entrench the lefts agenda on issues like same sex marriage stripping god out of the pledge of allegiance child pornography partial birth abortion and national security its obama who lacks the experience and judgment for the position that he seeks
5522932 well i think that the president of the united states has incredible responsibility in nominating people to the united states supreme court they are lifetime positions as well as the federal bench there will be two or maybe three vacancies this nomination should be based on the criteria of proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution of the united states of america and not legislating from the bench some of the worst damage has been done by legislating from the bench
5522933 even more troubling is what the illinois democrats answer betrays about his political habits of mind asked a question he didnt expect at a rare unscripted event the rookie candidate didnt merely say he disagreed with justice thomas instead he instinctively reverted to the leftwing clich that the courts black conservative isnt up to the job while his white conservative colleagues are
5522934 obama wants justices who will do his bidding who will implement the preferred policies of the liberal establishment not justices like thomas scalia roberts and alito who understand that the role of a judge is not to legislate from the bench
5522935 obamas answer about the three wisest people in his life upon whom he would rely heavily in his administration also sheds light on the way he would choose supreme court justices obama said he would consult his grandmother his wife and ted kennedy this is unlikely to yield the highest quality judicial nominees who understand the constitution and the role of judges in our constitutional democracy
5522936 technician armed the alarm i was just laughing my ass off but guess what next they scratched my rims
5522937 using the internal chinese martial art technique of tai chi is not necessary for kids and me to ship my wife away on her business trip
5522938 this a place i have been visting for the better part of 20 years or so
5522939 i am a professional agent and i would like to meet with you to discuss listing your house
5522940 frankly i am puzzled i have noticed your house did not sell we have sold many houses in your area would you mind meeting up to see why your house did not sell we have few buyers interested in your area and we could get it sold
5522941 while we offer a full range of dental services under one roof our emphasis is on more than one stop dental care
5522942 we want our patients to feel relaxed and at home as though they are coming to spend time with family
5522943 our upscale modern office is a reflection of our professional commitment to stay on the leading edge of dentistry
5522944 our patients shouldnt have to traipse from specialist to specialist to get the care they need
5522945 whether patients want to come in for a quick lunch hour whitening treatment or need extensive smile makeovers were prepared to serve them
5522946 our core belief is that patient education and prevention are as important as treatment
5522947 we want to make our community healthy which is why we offer free consultations and examinations as well as educational videos for patients to watch during their procedures
5522948 unfortunately that misses the point if you come in every six months for a dental check up you wont reach the level where you have a problem
5522949 you go for manicures for pedicures and to get your hair done having your teeth professionally cleaned is another facet of self care that makes you feel and look your best
5522950 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5522951 a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated
5522952 level of objectivity has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5522953 with all due respect to the campaign leadership they are viewing our coverage through a political prism
5522954 we stand by our reporting our journalism and our journalists
5522955 welcome to sub con the land of dreams we have been cursed by wart and we are completely under his evil spell we have been awaiting your arrival please defeat wart and return sub con to its natural state the curse wart has put on you in the real world will not have any effect upon you here remember wart hates vegetables please help us

5522970 i tell these voters that the state government is in the hands of the opposition so at the state assembly level i cant do much
5522971 therefore they have to give me the chance to be their member of parliament with the help of the federal government i can bring in a lot of help
5522972 i have one bad habit when i make friends its for life
5522973 however my charges have always delivered when it mattered and i expect them to do it again in bangkok other teams may have top pros but they are not invincible

5522976 it is time to organize a new american restoration movement the focus should not be on political ideology or partisanship but instead on an all fronts mobilization of individual americans to improve the social and moral infrastructure of america the movement must attempt to forge a new consensus on the basic values upon which a free society rests values almost entirely embodied in the concepts of respect and responsibility the restoration of america will begin within each individual and so we must enlist leadership from all sectors of society to rebuild american greatness around the tripod of culture the mission of the business and professional community should be ethics and quality the focus of education should be character and classical virtue the effort of politics should be to restore the integrity and competence of our public institutions

5522980 the san diego county republican central committee is made up of only 60 or 70 members and is way out of step with most republicans in california and san diego from governor schwarzenegger to san diego mayor jerry sanders both schwarzenegger and sanders oppose the hateful proposition 8 we got a pretty good response from the guests pulling in who seemed interested in the fact sheet and i am sure it was a topic of discussion inside the gate
5522981 everybody is starting to whisper that if obama has any prayer of winning he has to choose hillary and if he chooses hillary hes going to have to have somebody taste his food and start his car for him every day
5522982 i followed svetlana to simply gorgeous day spa from her other location at the time i didnt even know that it was going to be called that

5522984 absolutely 100 per cent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5522985 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into
5522986 immediately made those appointments and immediately called around for someone to start teaching me how to live macrobiotically
5522987 i did ask twice because im a stickler for accuracy
5522988 we could have done our homework much more diligently but it doesnt take away from the real story
5522989 sounds like your looking to being more of a real cyclist and should look into a second new bike thats a road bike

5523000 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5523001 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5523002 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5523003 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5523004 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5523005 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5523006 i dont believe that the citizens have a right to tell us about our personal beliefs and decisions
5523007 if god created marriage then god created marriage for people who are committed and love each other

5523016 the team are hoping to win the overall title in the v8 holden and win the class with the mitsubishi mirage pocket rockets

5523029 not sure if it was coincidental or not but my a c went out a day or two after i got my car back so i called and they told me to go ahead and
5523030 i know youll come back with your new car when you get one

5523051 i had lots of pitches working the off speed was good and so was the fastball
5523052 i had a couple good ones into lefties it was one of my better ones the last two starts were weird after i lost aggressiveness a little bit but today i was happy to get out of the trouble when i was able to focus better
5523053 its been a frustrating month and a half all around not playing good baseball
5523054 i made a huge mental mistake today i thought the count was 2 2 stuff like that has been going on all year
5523055 the good news is a lot of these technology companies are strong secular growers
5523056 they can grow at a nice rate even in a weakening economy
5523057 im not so sure weve found a bottom quite yet
5523058 theres a high likelihood that electronic arts ups its bid and a deal is made
5523059 electronic arts has the cash and it makes a lot of sense strategically
5523060 when you can grow market share you have a better chance to do well
5523061 we think search will hold up better than people expect
5523062 this is a well known company that is growing at much greater rates than the market
5523063 apple has less than 10 of the pc market its just getting into the cell phone market they have a lot of room to grow
5523064 certainly now what we want to see in pakistan is a period of political stability to enable the government and the parliament of pakistan to address the serious issues that pakistan faces including security issues because they have very direct consequences for the nearly thousand troops that we have in afghanistan abutting the afghanistan pakistan border
5523065 weve indicated to the pakistani government that were very happy to render whatever assistance we can in terms of helping the pakistan government meet the difficulties they face
5523066 there is a range of expertise that we have whether it is in the management of their parliamentary democracy whether it is in the development of their systems of democracy or whether it is giving technical advice to the difficult way in which a modern armed force needs to combat terrorism
5523067 as of this morning there were no residents asking for supplies
5523068 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring

5523075 im there to make sure the meeting runs well and fairly and that the vote is taken fairly and not to weigh in for or against any particular candidate
5523076 identify the emergency and work as one large team to protect and save lives and mitigate the hazards
5523077 they knew it was a cbrn chemical biological radioactive or nuclear event
5523078 and that it was a terrorist event they dont know what the chemical is they have to decide based on what they find and what they heard
5523079 it would be a challenge but if the community wanted it we would plan and find the resources to do it
5523080 its difficult to have the level of seriousness you would have in a real situation
5523081 they might be feeling a little frustrated and a little awkward about standing around

5523091 we hope that tomorrows decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era
5523092 we need these monitors in there and we need them now
5523093 if we cant get those military observers in there i dont think the cease fire will hold
5523094 im pretty much a fan that if youve been trained if you are registered then you ought to be able to carry a weapon
5523095 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorizations of the institution
5523096 i think they have a pretty clear and compelling reason to consider their security arrangement
5523097 its ridiculous to think that these people are going to have the expertise that law enforcement officers have
5523098 im not sure a teacher with just a concealed carry permit is the person you want protecting your school
5523099 they are showing their children theres lots to be afraid of youve got to have a weapon on your body at all times or youre in danger

5523130 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now maybe you havent noticed
5523131 russias objections to the sites have never been based on anything more than trying to define a sphere of influence in europe and on the territory of existing nato members
5523132 senator mccain believes that is unacceptable especially in the aftermath of russias brutal invasion of georgia
5523133 congress will not and should not fund a system until testing has proven that it works and that testing will not be completed until 2010 at the earliest
5523134 russias actions represent compelling data that should be convincing to democrats that we dont want to delay this thing
5523135 this is not just about missile defense this is about demonstrating to russia that america is still a nation of resolve and were not going to let russian expansionism intimidate everyone
5523136 what you have is an attempt to conflate the third site issue with russias provocation in the caucasus and theyre completely unrelated
5523137 russias primary concern was that we were exaggerating the iranian threat and therefore these sites in europe must be directed at them and weve gone a long way to try to dissuade them of that notion
5523138 this historic russian fear of encirclement is very much alive at the moment

5523181 we remain dedicated to finding and prosecuting the person responsible for nilanthans murder irrespective of whether the incident is racially motivated or otherwise
5523182 however should that prove to be the case it only serves to further highlight the tragedy of this young mans murder
5523183 we have now spoken to several witnesses and built up a good description of the suspect
5523184 i would urge local people to read it carefully and think about anyone they know who fits the description given that the suspect returned approximately 30 minutes after the exchange of words at the traffic lights it is highly likely he lives locally
5523185 the taxi driver has not come forward yet and it is vitally important we hear from him

5523203 that just makes me shudder the only way that you cannot have a gap is to continue to fly our existing system and that is the shuttle
5523204 i intend to set our priorities at nasa and to make sure existing programs are scrutinized and make sure theyre most effective
5523205 but space is still the last frontier i believe the american people will support it

5523218 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obama s varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5523219 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5523220 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5523221 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5523222 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5523223 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5523224 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5523225 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5523226 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issue as is the case of sen obama

5523232 the lettings market is booming with many vendors opting to rent their property while sales in the housing market continue to dry up many are willing to hold and await the return of capital appreciation
5523233 becoming a landlord is now an increasingly profitable option with rising rents and yields offering good returns
5523234 established investors have been reaping the benefits of the housing downturn for sometime and will continue to do so in the short term however ever increasing supply could have an impact on rental growth as tenant options increase
5523235 while a marked slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut when inflation peaks the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threats of a serious and prolonged recession
5523236 the longer the mpc waits before cutting rates the bigger the danger that the economic situation would deteriorate
5523237 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation
5523238 our central scenario envisages that the uk bank rate would be cut to 4

5523248 the evidence showed khan was a committed and active supporter of al qaida ideology he had extensive amounts of the sort of information that a terrorist would need and use and the international contacts to pass it on
5523249 the prosecution case was that aabid khan was the link between sultan muhammed and hammaad khan police found the three had computer files and discs books documents and videos as the tools of their trade terrorism
5523250 there were not only items of propaganda but practical guides on making explosives and poisons and a particularly chilling step by step video guide of how to make a suicide vest
5523251 aabid khan was very much the mr fix it of the group
5523252 when looking at the evidence against hammaad munshi i was satisfied there was enough for a case to go to court and that it was in the public interest despite his young age
5523253 the prosecution told the jury of his dedication to the cause of al qaida and of discussions with aabid khan which included how he could travel abroad and smuggle a sword with him

5523266 sen mccain is expected to host a rally on august 29 in dayton and is looking for a big venue and for a big crowd hell get it this is not yet public i guess i just made it so
5523267 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5523268 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama

5523270 during the cold war sweden played a stabilizing role in northern europe today the swedish defense forces are almost dismantled and our neighboring countries do not any longer see sweden as a serious actor from a security perspective neither in the baltic region nor in the north
5523271 we should not weaken the swedish defense to the degree that our ability to defend ourselves is questioned

5523282 our experience is that sharing waters are more commonly a point of cooperation rather than conflict and we will continue to work in this area given the increasing demand for water
5523283 this essential treaty has been stalled for more than a decade largely due to the failure of nations in not signing up to what they long ago agreed to
5523284 most of the worlds trans boundary river basins lack adequate legal protection and the world needs a global framework for sustainably managing and preventing disputes over those resources this is the only such framework available in the timescale to help us deal with a growing water crisis
5523285 take ethiopia and egypt which have negotiated trade agreements following the nile basin initiative
5523286 the experts are telling us that rivalries over water will be a significant source of future conflict as indeed they already are

5523307 there is no fear of a nuclear bomb coming out of this region but the bigger danger is that a small amount of uranium combined with conventional explosive terrorists could make a dirty bomb that would make an area the size of the citys square mile unusable for 30 or 40 years

5523309 the rise of the stupid network why the intelligent network was a good idea once but isnt anymore
5523310 was like a glass of cold water in the face
5523311 it may soon assume cult status among the tech mavens that roam the world wide web
5523312 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5523313 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5523314 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5523315 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5523316 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5523317 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5523318 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5523319 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5523320 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5523321 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5523322 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5523323 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5523324 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5523325 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5523326 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into
5523327 immediately made those appointments and immediately called around for someone to start teaching me how to live macrobiotically
5523328 just this year alone 2008 our fuel hedges will likely save us close to 2 billion
5523329 and our annual revenues are about 11 billion so its a very very significant part of our success
5523330 they have less training costs less spare parts to carry they have essentially a uni plane fleet smart move
5523331 a plane comes in here to bwi its ready to go out in 20 minutes nobody else comes close to that
5523332 its a very successful fuel hedging company with an unprofitable airline on the side
5523333 the industry as a whole is broken theres way too much capacity that is fundamentally unprofitable there are airlines that are much much worse run and until those go away
5523334 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5523335 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5523336 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5523337 i know that none of us are immune from anything
5523338 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5523339 the mom was playing religious tapes in the room and obviously was very focused on looking for a miracle
5523340 caught her in the side of the head she had no pulse when they pulled her out of the water
5523341 we just cant shut that machine off then you know what we cant shut that machine off
5523342 you might have a family thats having a hard time and it might take another day and thats ok
5523343 this is almost like a once in a lifetime situation
5523344 ive been really focusing on my technique and some of the things ive seen from the top swimmers
5523345 i have had a number of friends whove asked me about it in the last week
5523346 we were getting 50 hits 75 hits a day before the olympics
5523347 and now we are getting 5 10 000 hits a day
5523348 this definitely gets you like kinda stoked to get back in the water and try and get back in shape
5523349 we know only a quarter of suicide patients are our clients which means 75 percent of them never come through our doors
5523350 we need to focus on prevention building resilience in students and creating communities
5523351 i think ive just continued to get better in the preseason in the games and in practice so this will be another step to take
5523352 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5523353 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have
5523354 completions turnovers to just the feeling we have on who can manage the game the best for us all of things like that
5523355 and the good thing about evaluating both rex and kyle weve had a long time to do it its been quite a few years weve had a chance to see both guys play
5523356 people make such a big deal about that my rookie year and everything but i think everybody on this team has gotten better since they were a rookie and not just me
5523357 that stuffs in the past and im just focused on playing good football now
5523358 my accuracy has improved my command of the offense has improved and just being able to play at a high level
5523359 both guys were in the same situation which is a good part about it
5523360 both guys played both preseason games with the same line i think we did about what we could to let them compete fairly for the position
5523361 i wasnt even sure what the contract situation was to be honest
5523362 no competitor will agree with a decision when it doesnt go their way
5523363 rex is a team player hes been in this situation before and hell do whatever he needs to do to help our football team win
5523364 we dont name any guys starters for lifetime or anything like that but we feel real good about kyle just like we feel good about olin kreutz being our center and lance briggs being our linebacker
5523365 el objetivo principal ser analizar sobre las consecuencias e impactos de la crisis mundial alimentaria generada por el incremento en los precios de los combustibles y los granos b sicos y buscar estrategias para hacer frente a esta situaci n

5523371 this complex and sensitive inquiry has been part of the largest investigation of its kind within the uk the success of the operation is very much down to the excellent working relationship between cleveland police ceop centre met police and cleveland crown prosecution service cps
5523372 he thompson was a senior administrator for a paedophile website todays sentence reflects how seriously the criminal justice system views those who take gratification from the sexual abuse of children
5523373 id like to make it clear that these websites cannot be stumbled across by their very nature they are hidden and people are directed to them but what i want to re iterate is that people who visit these sites leave a trail and we will follow that trail and find them
5523374 the evidence showed that philip thomson had in his possession one of the largest collections of images of child abuse in the uk
5523375 i provided pre charge advice to cleveland police and decided that philip thompson should not face just one or two specimen charges relating to the images but a total of 27 charges to reflect the criminality of his behaviour and to give the court adequate sentencing powers
5523376 thompson was a critical piece of this jigsaw network he was the librarian warehouseman for a myriad of images that were distributed to like minded individuals both in this country and elsewhere
5523377 i hope this result acts as a deterrent and sends out a clear warning that activity such as this will not be tolerated

5523382 these bills are a follow up to the successful passage in parliament in may of the water and sewerage corporations act and the water and sewerage industry act which provided for the structural reform and regulatory framework for the sector
5523383 the purpose of the draft water and sewerage industry amendment bill 2008 is to provide for the appropriate powers and obligations that the sectoral participants will require
5523384 these general powers and obligations are similar to those that govern the electricity and gas industry as well as in the water and sewerage sector in other jurisdictions mainly victoria and nsw
5523385 the purpose of the draft water and sewerage consequential and transition bill 2008 is to repeal and amend certain existing arrangements that are required to make very clear the separate roles and responsibilities between regulation and service provision
5523386 this will ensure an effective framework exists in time for the new corporations to commence full operations on july 1 2009

5523394 around november or december 2007 a man came into the office he was crying and his arms were bruised seeking assistance

5523448 we need to get back to compromise negotiation respect for people people in government need to respect each other to get results and i know these things wont happen over night but we need to work towards those goals barack can lead by example

5523458 his speech was down to earth in the way he talks to people and understands their problems
5523459 i thought he was a really good speaker in person
5523460 he addressed the issues and he made it plain that our interests are his interests
5523461 to me hes not a celebrity hes a man of substance
5523462 i think hes nice and i think hes sincere in what he says

5523545 i think franck will continue to surprise many people this year
5523546 he was without a doubt the best driver in atlantics last season and i think he is a great addition to our team we knew before the test in sebring that we were signing franck for the year now everyone knows why we are so excited to secure him for 2008 the chemistry with franck is excellent and he is an experienced professional a pleasure to work with our focus is to take this team to the next level and franck will help us achieve that goal
5523547 conquest racing is committed to taking the next step up and adding franck to the line up is evidence of our desire to fight for the win every race weekend franck is an extremely talented driver and he has proved that in every series in which he has competed i think we can expect great things from him
5523548 this is a great moment and opportunity for me to be joining the champ car world series with a team like conquest racing
5523549 i want to again thank both eric and anthony blumberg for believing in my ability even though we had our eye on part of the 2 million team scholarship i am very grateful to my managers at cjmotorsport who were still able to put together a deal for me without it i cant wait for the upcoming test in laguna seca to get back behind the wheel again and continue my preparation for long beach
5523550 it wasnt that we thought we were too good to run anymore or anything like that we accomplished what we needed to do what we set out to do and we didnt see much point in running around any more laps for us to finish today 1 2 i mean david was right behind me and i think we had really strong cars today its just such a huge boost for the team weve worked really hard in the preseason and for the first time running with everyone and for it to all come together like this and to end this test 1 2 its huge for everyone david did a great job both engineers are working really hard and the crew is awesome now were just looking forward to when it really counts in long beach
5523551 we made some improvements on the car reviewed data overnight and we were there james put in a very quick lap time and we were just under a 10th behind him its a good step forward for the team and we kept the momentum going from yesterday you cant ask for more from the team than to run 1 2 in the first test im extremely happy and really excited to get on with the season
5523552 the track has a lot of grip and its more physical that way especially with the bumps
5523553 its definitely more physical but the cars like it and theyre a lot of fun to drive a lot of times we come to sebring to test for street courses since it is bumpy and there are concrete patches now that youre here and theres so much grip it doesnt really simulate the first day especially of a street course it starts to simulate the second day a little bit but its still a little bit too grippy for that
5523554 no everything is good for the first time in the car im quite happy everybody is very motivated inside the team i was at the factory working with the engineers the mechanics and everything was fine but you never know until you get in the car obviously things are going well we did everything we wanted to do so its cool i just hope i will stay in the car for the championship
5523555 sebring is not my favorite track it doesnt really show what the car can do however im pretty happy to see how things were going today we made a lot of improvement compared to yesterday when we were struggling a little the car was doing what i wanted at the end of the day it was just unfortunate that there was so much grip on the track it was almost not drivable but im happy and the team is doing a really good job
5523556 so far it is going very good we are doing a lot of developing of the car we are changing a lot of things and we are progressing testing things for the year champ car is cool its fun its a heavy powerful car and this is a bumpy track but its cool its different than what i have done before you never know when the turbo is going to kick in so you have to be ready for the oversteer
5523557 it is going well i think being away from single seaters for the last two years makes it hard at the beginning
5523558 everything is completely different we are making constant progress we are not yet where we want to be which is closer to the leaders but we are moving in that direction which is positive yesterday i did 103 laps so that was hard physically and today we should do about 100 laps but its going well without major problems and i am confident that with a little bit more work we can be more competitive
5523559 we see a great synergy in bringing two of our successful sports marketing activities together
5523560 champ car racing and golf are both dramatic tension filled sports that require precision and complete focus from their competitors however champ car races are certainly a little more fast paced than any golf tournament ive ever seen
5523561 the bridgestone golf division is relatively new so creating a closer link to bridgestone firestone north american tire llc bfnt makes perfect sense for us
5523562 golfers are an appealing demographic that tend to buy high performance tires so we think bridgestone golf can be an effective way for bfnt to gain important brand exposure to a highly desirable consumer group working together will benefit both sides of the business
5523563 its similar to setting up a small town for a weekend
5523564 with more than 175 000 people expected to attend theyll need everything from hospitality suites to rest rooms to trash containers to a hundred other little things
5523565 and thats only half our job come sunday night when the last race engine is switched off well take everything apart inspect it and start getting it all ready again for 2009
5523566 year in and year out dwight and his staff in conjunction with our suppliers and the city of long beach do a tremendous job constructing a circuit which is challenging for the drivers as well as providing a variety of spectacular viewing areas for our fans
5523567 they accomplish this while making a strong effort to minimize the impact on downtown businesses
5523568 it was a crescendo each session we were faster and we tested many things for all the phases of a race weekend and we did well in each so its good that we can already fight with the top guys
5523569 its a dream for all drivers to work with such a professional team i said it before and i will say it again this team can and will be competing for the championship i loved the experience and working with oriol servia was fantastic were quick and the team is happy we didnt have any problems throughout the test all we need now is to move forward and hopefully make the line up and if it does happen i think it would be a turning point in my career
5523570 im very very happy and very impressed with the team
5523571 we did the last race in mexico and we obviously had a good car they have been working hard all winter and all the new things they did they were better so im really happy the conditions today were nothing like you are going to find this season so we didnt really want to focus too much on the set up we just wanted to test and try things and thats what we did it was also good to have alex here to compare notes
5523572 its been good very nice to get back in the car after the off season we are testing a lot of new stuff to improve the car overall for the street courses this year and things are going well
5523573 the team ended the day first and third so thats a good place to start sebring is kind of an enigma in itself so you cant take too much away from this but for the sake of the team and for the confidence of both me and david its a good place to start were looking forward to long beach more than anything weve got two tests still to go but we know weve got a good package underneath us now i just want to go racing
5523574 a lot of the teams have been here in their private testing in weeks previous to this test and we havent so we were a little bit behind when we first got here this morning this afternoon has been awesome its a new team for me joining sierra sierra this year and im just working on gelling with the team i cant tell you how excited i am to get to long beach and start the year
5523575 its a great confidence booster for our whole team we worked really hard in the preseason and to come to the first test and be quick its just a really good payoff the whole team is working really great and the car is doing what i want it to do so it speaks of good things for the team im looking forward to starting racing forsythe is such a big organization and everything is so well prepared you have so much confidence in the team im very happy to be here
5523576 i was just learning to work with the team and learning the car i think everything is going as planned we will see how tomorrow goes but im pleased with what happened today
5523577 it was an interesting day a little hard physically though because since my last race in atlantic which was in august i only did one test back in november but i should be good by the end of the test
5523578 im a bit surprised to be honest to be at the top its a new track for me new people to work with and a new car but everybody did a really good job to get everything prepared the team is showing its potential and that it can fight for the top however today is only the first day and there is still a lot of testing time left but it feels good to be with the top guys
5523579 we didnt run new tires at the end so when you look at it like that i think we were second or third before everybody put tires on
5523580 the track is obviously pretty good and overall our cars are performing well right now and im happy because im never normally near the top in sebring so its good for me
5523581 i hadnt been in a car since november and in the morning session we were already third everything is going so well this team is so professional were working on different set ups for the car and they are very happy with the feedback im giving them its so much easier to work with a team when the chemistry is there right from the start and you dont have to build that up first i think this team will definitely be contending for the championship
5523582 when we looked at the trade offs it seemed like a wise thing to do
5523583 a little more breathing room but there was also a fair amount of disappointment
5523584 the human brain is always trying to determine why things happen and when the reason is not clear we tend to make up some pretty bizarre explanations
5523585 christians and new agers paranormalists etc all have one thing in common a spiritual orientation to the world
5523586 i believe they do exist but im not sure about this
5523587 i guess we will find out if this is on the up and up
5523588 while it is difficult to know for certain the tendency to believe in the paranormal appears to be there from the beginning
5523589 what changes is the content of the paranormal for example very few people believe in faeries and elves these days but as belief in faeries faded other beliefs such as belief in ufos emerged to take their place
5523590 humans first started believing in the supernatural because they were trying to understand things they couldnt explain
5523591 its basically the same process as mythology at one point people didnt understand why the sun rose and set each day so they suggested that a chariot pulled the sun across the heavens
5523592 they didnt understand why a child was stillborn or why a drought occurred so they came to believe that such events had supernatural causes
5523593 all societies have invoked the supernatural to explain things beyond their control and understanding especially good and bad events
5523594 in many places even today people believe that disasters or bad luck is caused by witches or curses
5523595 i believe that new orleans had a level of sin that was offensive to god and they are were recipients of the judgment of god for that
5523596 paranormal beliefs are very strongly negatively related to religious belief
5523597 this may partly reflect opinions of christians in the samples who take biblical sanctions against many paranormal activities seriously
5523598 the investigators have made a significant stride and hopefully this dreadful case is coming to its conclusion
5523599 a number of individuals were detained and questioned as a result of a proactive operation
5523600 consequently some have been charged with drug related offences unconnected to the mullanys murder the two females arrested and charged last week are still in custody at her majestys prison
5523601 we are not in a position to disclose any details regarding their arrests and charges except to say they are linked to the other three persons presently in police custody
5523602 we were informed this morning of the news from antigua and we are pleased at how the investigation is progressing
5523603 we are not going to make any further comment at this time and we would ask that the media continues to respect our privacy
5523604 earlier today we informed the families of ben and catherine mullany of the latest developments in antigua the force is continuing its support of the ongoing investigation and trained family liaison officers are continuing to support the families and keep them fully updated on events both in the uk and antigua
5523605 the whole country was in shock from this terrible crime
5523606 these charges will bring some degree of relief to the families of the victims the community and everyone who values life
5523607 one who is not taking part in the battle nor has the sheer intention to die is in the branch of hypocrisy
5523608 what i want to do is cause trouble for the kuffar non believers with hit and runs everywhere cause fear and panic in their countries make them nervous so they make mistakes
5523609 the material in their possession promoted extreme ideology most notoriously of osama bin laden of al qaida as well as groups in various countries that adopted it
5523610 these men were not simply in possession of material which expressed extremist views they were also in possession of material that was operationally useful to anyone wishing to carry out an act of violence or terrorism
5523611 im clear absolutely 100 percent clear and clean they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5523612 i was so mad and i i just remember i was i was just shaking
5523613 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5523614 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5523615 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5523616 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5523617 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5523618 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5523619 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5523707 hi there this article is about the benefits of facing frightening questions
5523708 when we feel the need to adopt a contrived artificial persona in our jobs perhaps with the goal of looking tough submissive outgoing or something else we create the kind of frustration that has us put off our work
5523709 every day we make many tiny decisions that affect our lives one of the decisions we make almost unconsciously is the way we talk to ourselves and the way our words affect our attitude and our action
5523710 measuring progress is a process aimed at determining whether goals are being achieved
5523711 you know its easy to get tongue tied and bumble around up here trying to use humor but you folks wont make a mess of it like i am doing

5523713 our long term goal is not to have an adversarial relationship with russia but it cannot be business as usual
5523714 while 85 of all intra sadc trade is duty free in 2008 we must acknowledge that the work is not yet complete
5523715 the remaining 15 of trade is still to be liberalised by 2012 and we need to ensure that all members are able jointly to meet that milestone
5523716 profound and even limiting impact on the process of deepening integration at the regional level

5523722 for the past several months we have been working closely with and konami to ensure that playstation 3 guitars and drum sets will all feature a basic level of gameplay compatibility for the most part this means that the titles with musical peripherals will work with the others software a few specific examples include rock revolution software and yes you guessed it rock band 2s guitar and drum set will work with guitar hero world tour and with rock revolution conversely rock revolutions drum set will work with both guitar hero world tour and rock band 2 in addition guitar hero world tour and rock band 2 will both support the singstar microphones were still working hard to ensure compatibility between the guitar hero and rock band titles currently on the market and we hope to have an announcement on that shortly of course each of these great games have their own specific cool features that may not be compatible with the other controllers but this is our first big step in bringing a level of compatibility to music games that is sure to benefit playstation 3 consumers
5523723 i was wondering if you have accepted jesus christ as your lord and savior
5523724 i have deep religious beliefs and values i had experiences in my life where i had to rely on god not to get me through another day or another hour but another minute
5523725 i also believe that talking too much about ones faith and religion in my view is something between me and god
5523726 i have attended north phoenix baptist church for many years and the most important thing is that im a christian

5523732 al calentarse el agua aumenta el consumo de ox geno de los organismos marinos baja la solubilidad del ox geno en el mar y baja el intercambio con la atm sfera

5523735 minorities now roughly one third of the u s population are expected to become the majority in 2042 with the nation projected to be 54 percent minority in 2050
5523736 who went to valladolid spain in 1590 became a jesuit laybrother and returned to england in 1598
5523737 inspired by people like me with names that begin with or contain a y born in cuba in the 1970s and 1980s marked by schools in the countryside russian cartoons illegal emigration and frustration
5523738 let it go and bring it out to the twenty
5523739 that has to happen in order for us to get where we want to go thats a challenge
5523740 what ive noticed this year more so than any other year is that we have a lot of unity theres no egos and everybody is trying to work together so we can grow as a group its really working out well so far
5523741 were more athletic as a defense in years past we may have had more experience than we do now but well get to that point once we mentally get everything down and gain more experience we have a chance to be even better
5523742 great things are not done by impulse but by a series
5523743 this is the hallmark of a recession and a hallmark of a bear market
5523744 how can there possibly be a recession with gdp positive
5523745 playing in a little recession on average troughs go down 25
5523746 are you talking about the possibility that we can actually test the 2002 lows
5523747 gee arent you going to turn more bullish with oil prices going down
5523748 ah ha oil is coming down im going to raise my 2001 gdp forecast
5523749 four percent 10 year note whod want to touch it
5523750 what do young jews like these days pancakes okay well have a pancake breakfast and hopefully isaacs hand will brush against rachels while theyre both reaching for the maple syrup and well get some babies out of this
5523751 if you dont love israel youre not a good jew
5523752 soon as you could read and write off you went
5523753 i got there at the end i didnt do anything
5523754 the headline read kaplan arrives but the real work was done by others
5523755 richardson will help with sw states hispanics shore up diplomacy and energy plsn
5523756 recalled brent who today works with young swimmers at a pool in exposition park
5523757 weve had some great point guards come out of there but no swim team anymore
5523758 at the outset that was not part of the strategic piece but it does work out that a high visibility event like the olympics would help to raise the visibility of this program
5523759 there were not a lot of opportunities for not just african americans the same drowning rates were seeing in the african american community were also seeing in the hispanic native american and other multicultural communities
5523760 you know what it is its opportunity encouragement and good coaching obviously you needed to know how to swim before you could join a swim team so there was that missing link for usa swimming
5523761 usa swimmings goal is to create olympic medalists but you cant become involved unless you know how to swim
5523762 the kids will be watching swimming in the olympics and maybe theyll want to be swimmers
5523763 theres always a surge in the olympic sports within a few months of everyone watching the olympic games
5523764 it will be more of a result as opposed to a goal
5523765 we know that the more people that are involved in the sport the better the chances are that more diverse athletes will matriculate up through the programs
5523766 its rare that youll have a moral imperative like saving lives through learning to swim align so seamlessly with a strategic imperative like growing the base of the sport and making it more inclusive
5523767 first of all chris rock is still married and his wife picked out a beautiful gift for me after we finished shooting a marc jacobs purse it was only a movie
5523768 im in a really good place right now not being with someone is a good time to learn about yourself
5523769 i find that being out in the sun is better for you than people think like when i started going back to the beach and being in the saltwater and the sun my skin improved a lot so i benefit from sunshine
5523770 give your mother a hug and tell her the president sent it
5523771 huh the person i love the most is sitting right here my mother
5523772 i cannot imagine topping that experience ive never played a wedding before and i probably wont again until its my own
5523773 he was really mean to me and he used to tease me for having hairy arms
5523774 i teased him too though especially for having been a model
5523775 why dont you just get the band back together jasons into it
5523776 hey i was really drunk last night i dont know what happened but are we going to do this
5523777 yo heres my e mail address keep in touch and next time we come through well put you on the list
5523778 hey can you put something together for the cheap shots album
5523779 what are you guys doing are you ready to get serious
5523780 in 2006 there were just 819 women aged 20 24 living there out of a total population of 21 421 according to the most recent census
5523781 theres no point questioning the actions of a c0ck juggling thunderc nt
5523782 when i was a kid there was an ice storm in the suburbs we went to manhattan to stay with a friend of my moms there was nobody on the road it was this moment that couldve been scary for a kid but she made it festive
5523783 thats what nick is like he takes the hard part of a situation and makes it celebratory
5523784 were so looking forward to working with each again and we just need to find a time in our diaries when we can get into the studio together
5523785 i am prepared to go into a room full of co2 for two minutes if he is prepared to go into a room full of radiation for two minutes
5523786 with climate change in order to be serious you need to acknowledge that the end of the world is an interesting detail in the broader pattern of economic progress but never succumb to the incredible naivety of the protesters who fail to realize that the survival of life on earth is a bourgeois luxury which we can ill afford in these times of economic constraint
5523787 this is a decision the group made together so that they could continue to evolve as individuals it wasnt forced by me or any of the higher ups or anything like that
5523788 a new disc called greatest hits of rbd will be released this year with 15 of their most popular songs and later theyll record a new album thats slated for an early 2009 release we also want to make a movie but well see how that pans out with the tour and saying goodbye to their fans
5523789 certainly we need to keep learning as much as we can about the car and try to hone in on a good set up for myself and for justin
5523790 ill be the first to admit i struggled at sebring in the champ car it was quite a tough track for me but just go there and learn as much as we can its been a while since any of us have sat in the car and its going to be quite the change of pace from what ive been driving recently but im certainly looking forward to it
5523791 well to start with the first thing is getting used to the team getting used to the car and the environment
5523792 so the first test is all going to be about getting familiar with my environment and learning how to extract the most out of it so this is going to be a steep learning curve this first test then hopefully well learn a few things and move on from that in the next few months and you know find what suits my style and which bits are going to help us work best on the race weekend to go out there and win races
5523793 i was impressed by the team when i tested with them two years ago
5523794 unfortunately we were not able to get a deal together that year but i am excited to have the opportunity now
5523795 alex is a very competitive and capable driver that has consistently placed among the leaders in races and the championship standings over the years
5523796 testing alex in sebring will give pkv racing an opportunity to receive the benefit of his experience as we work through the various projects we have for this test in addition it will give us a chance to see how alex meshes with our team as we proceed with our search for a second driver
5523797 this is a team that is capable of winning the championship this year and it would be a dream come true for me to be with pkv in 2008
5523798 i think i can help them get to the top of the standings but first things first and that is to get our work done and have a good test in sebring after that we will see where things go from there
5523799 im very excited to be able to go to sebring with pacific coast motorsports
5523800 ive always been very fond of the team and i actually started my champ car career with their junior team so its a great feeling to be able to drive their car again
5523801 everybody knows champ car is huge in mexico and also among the hispanic community in the united states so im really looking forward to giving everybody a great result at this test and hopefully for the whole year
5523802 we took evidence from nick gruen we took evidence from the productivity commission we sought information widely and we came up with a set of recommendations that we believe is appropriate for the industry and also for the australian economy more broadly
5523803 this is all about different interpretations of economic models now that we are at a low tariff level the impact of further tariff reductions is almost negligible either way
5523804 tariffs are actually less important to the motor vehicle industry than they have ever been other issues such as worldwide competition fuel prices and carbon emissions are much more important tariffs are one of the least important factors
5523805 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5523806 a less complicated but more useful add on is gmail manager which helps you keep multiple gmail accounts straight
5523807 one of my favorite features of linux today is the talkbacks a lot of times theyre better than the articles or at least funny why would anyone choose windows over linux
5523808 the machine was in a constant loop even attempting to get into safe mode was no help her machine was protected with avg and yet the clipboard hijack spreads panic
5523809 first reported by ie users on windows due to its flexible spreading method the same behavior was then reported later by mac and linux strange skype network activity even on linux
5523810 when i went back upstairs in the evening i noticed the that the 5ghz led and the internet led on my shiny new netgear wndr 3300 wireless
5523811 before i leave however i figured it would be good to note and then bury three myths that i heard perpetuated by microsoft at the
5523812 today was certainly more action than hes gotten and the plan is to get him in saturday
5523813 hes getting a lot better hes in shape so im hopeful we go this week each day without any setbacks
5523814 ive been in this league for seven years and you know how to take care of your body
5523815 you see guys coming in and out of this league and the guys who take care of their bodies the best are the guys that stay in the league im doing everything i can on my part im excited about the opportunity and i dont want to do something stupid and hurt something else by pushing too hard weve got a couple of good weeks ahead of us to be ready for the real games
5523816 if you dont see me out there practicing im working on the treadmill underwater so im getting myself prepared and in shape
5523817 the only thing i can do is keep concentrating on learning the offensive play book which i think i have a good grasp ive spent some good time with drew its going to be fun weve got a lot of time like i said this week im going to push it a little bit more just to see how it goes from there
5523818 we probably would have expected him to have gotten more work probably in the second preseason game but were here right now and weve got plenty of practice opportunities for him
5523819 the down side would be pushing it and having a setback and not having him for the first week of the season
5523820 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5523821 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5523822 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5523823 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5523824 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5523825 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5523826 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5523827 sen jones has been a passionate advocate who has fought for working families and the underprivileged
5523828 used his position as senate president to give those without a voice better health care better funded schools and increases in the minimum wage
5523829 emil jones is a man with a big heart and a man of action
5523830 i can work with attila the hun if i have to
5523831 theres other names up there that are just astounding some of our favorite artists and politicians
5523832 but its going to be really cool to see that in 10 years 20 years from now
5523833 a lot of kids feel lonely when they first get diagnosed with diabetes im just so encouraged at the end of the day because all im trying to do is make it through another day managing diabetes
5523834 theyre just doing the same thing were all there for each other
5523835 we run around onstage constantly for about an hour and 45 minutes and we know what that can do you just feel great at the end of the night and when you wake up in the morning
5523836 but we do me and joe are both of voting age so we do endorse voting getting to know the issues learning about the candidates and making a decision for yourself
5523837 s o dois jogadores que merecem toda a aten o mas penso que devemos nos preocupar com todo time deles por m sou mais a nossa sele o e espero que eles tenham mais problemas com nossos jogadores
5523838 mais um fator que me faz sentir uma motiva o especial eu estava muito concentrado para aquele jogo e agora n o quero perder a chance de atuar toda a partida
5523839 n o se completou o prazo at a meia noite para chegar a um acordo
5523840 al m dos militares empregados da petr leos de venezuela s a pdvsa e quatro ju zes est o implementando a medida de desapropria o realizando os tr mites necess rios para a opera o
5523841 ainda falta a negocia o com a cemex n o foi poss vel chegar a um acordo com eles o prazo expira esta noite o passo seguinte o da desapropria o
5523842 pois o valor solicitado pela cemex muito alto muito acima dos us 1 3 bilh o
5523843 si quieres salvar el per hazlo t mismo no esperes que lo haga otro
5523844 para las clases dominantes la democracia se restringe s lo a los nivelesformales de decisi n pol tica pues defienden en primer t rmino su situaci ndeprivilegio manteniendo las diferencias sociales y econ micas existentes al no ser hombres iguales los que la ley define como tales el postulado de la igualdad llega a la caricatura
5523845 es pues necesario hacer una primera distinci n entre la democracia como concepto abstracto como principio y aspiraci n generalizada en nuestro mundo y el sistema de democracia representativa que es el que las clases dominantes pregonan cuando ello favorece a la apropiaci n privada de los medios de producci n
5523846 a partir de esta realidad estructural la sociedad peruana tiene dos clases b sicas polares una que es propietaria de los medios de producci n tiene el control del poder econ mico en la sociedad y por tanto el poder pol tico otra la clase de los que no tienen propiedad de medios de producci n que deben utilizar su fuerza de trabajo laborando en las f bricas y oficinas a cambio de un salario o sueldo y que son marginados del poder pol tico por los grupos dominantes la polarizaci n de intereses antag nicos de ambas se define como lucha de clases
5523847 en todos estos casos la ideolog a dominante vuelve a mentir al decir que en el sistema capitalista se progresa trabajando la vedad es que mientras las cosas sigan como est n el trabajador podr laborar horas y a os enteros acambio del mismo salario mientras el due o del capital seguir ganando enormes cantidades a costa de ese trabajo podr amos continuar indefinidamente demostrando c mo la clase dominante adormece la conciencia del pueblo con planteamientos como estudiar para triunfar cuando el pueblo sabe que con su quinto de media terminado cuando se puede lograr sale del colegio a trabajar en lo mismo que podr a hacer con tercero o segundo de primaria
5523848 la clase dirigente maneja el pensamiento de las personas no s lo con la difusi n masiva de sus ideas y valores sino con la articulaci n parcial de diversos intereses los valores inculcados incluyen la aspiraci n de ascenso social individual que lleva a una l gica de ascenso social que tiene a la burgues a como modelo
5523849 por eso decimos que la democracia representativa es un mito una mentira ideol gica que esconde una dictadura de las clases dominantes
5523850 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5523851 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5523852 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5523853 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5523854 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5523855 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5523856 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5523857 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5523858 we often see if theres an adult many times with a leash in his hand saying he lost his puppy and he needs help first of all this is wrong if an adult needs help they need to go to another adult these are things parents need to tell their children
5523859 i came to the united states when i was 17 and i pretty much worked in all kinds of places washing dishes serving tables everything until in nov 2004 i made the decision to join the u s military
5523860 as there are no direct flights to london hes boasted he may just disappear into asia and start his life afresh
5523861 he does not have a sentence to serve in london he can stop where he wants
5523862 i came back to the uk and got wheeled off the plane felt a bit like elizabeth taylor
5523863 got an mri scan this morning and am now sitting up in bed with my left foot like a dead fish
5523864 annie is now recuperating at home she would like to thank all who have sent their well wishes in the past few days
5523865 theres a bat in the house and it might have rabies
5523866 our company is a happy flourishing environment with great people serving our customers and creating growth and prosperity for us all
5523867 and we are exceeding our goal of x xxx xxx per quarter

5523884 i never dreamed i would do something like this one day
5523885 the one thing the lord doesnt have enough of is a backwind
5523886 we need to show them christians believe in a god in heaven who cares about those on earth
5523887 what really made it for me is that evangelism is not just putting up a sign outside
5523888 early on in iowa we always recycled its important for newspapers beer bottles or cans i wanted to do that for las vegas because i didnt really see that
5523889 as a restaurant we create a great deal of waste its our job to lower the impact
5523890 ive been told you can drink this but it cuts grease better than anything else
5523891 we can use that for our cars public transportation for our own cars heating and cooling for our businesses
5523892 its very hard to run a small business and i think if theyre trying to do everything they can it shows a positive outcome for the community
5523893 we decided not to take part in a bid for the acquisition of daewoo shipbuilding
5523894 in a recent meeting of top executives we decided to focus more on strengthening the key existing business division of the group than on creating new business we will also give up our plan of taking over hyundai engineering and construction
5523895 in den flugh fen diesen tempeln von zivilisation und technik herrschen in wirklichkeit die gesetze des dschungels
5523896 eine berm chtige soldateska macht sich im wege der erpressung sonst k nnen sie nicht mitfliegen an ihrem intimbereich zu schaffen durchleuchtet und durchw hlt ihre taschen betastet ihren k rper und befummelt ihre g rtelschnalle
5523897 you cant really appreciate the joy of winning until youve failed along the way
5523898 dont worry well be home soon be a good boy
5523899 if youre a million away the only guy who benefits is the agent
5523900 tell your agent im tired of sitting at home its time to put the toys away be a man and get down to business
5523901 small and medium sized enterprises are making investments overseas due to high domestic costs including increased personnel costs and land prices said dr
5523902 laudatory effort to ensure that front line agents are given clear rules to follow in pursuit of their investigations
5523903 nevertheless efforts to harmonize the rules governing criminal and national security matters also raise potential civil liberties concerns given the broader latitude currently given to investigators to consider race and ethnicity in national security matters
5523904 the important aims of the guidelines and their potential implications for civil liberties require a meaningful dialogue between congress and doj
5523905 we continue to discuss this with congress and we are carefully reviewing the suggestions we have received from these discussions
5523906 looking at hindsight obviously we would do things differently today
5523907 it was very painful the fact that you have someone telling you they will not help you because of who you are that they will deny your right to be a mother and have a family
5523908 if you remove a school bus from the road youre adding 40 to 50 cars in the morning and in the afternoon
5523909 our goal was to keep those cuts as far away from the classroom as possible
5523910 what if fuel should go up by a quarter in a period of a month or two
5523911 we might have to have some emergency response to that
5523912 are you going to walk a half mile down the street to cross in the appropriate way when you see a clear way right there
5523913 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5523914 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5523915 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5523916 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5523917 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5523918 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5523919 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5523920 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5523921 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5523922 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5523923 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5523924 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5523925 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square senator obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5523926 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5523927 it is hard to understand how senator mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5523928 i did give them documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5523929 one would have to assume that its going to be this week
5523930 we are excited about getting this long term contract done with will
5523931 we view him as one of our core players and look forward to him having an impact on our defense for years to come
5523932 it was a long negotiation and a great deal for both will and the saints
5523933 they tell me the surgery went well but thats all i know right now
5523934 hes a great guy to take the time to help a younger guy but im going to have to pick it up on my own now
5523935 we wish him a great recovery and weve got to move on its the whole defensive lines responsibility to help in those situations that hollis has left open from his injury but i dont feel any pressure personally
5523936 that is a big void to full hollis is one of those guys who really prides himself on protecting the linebackers and keeping the double teams off the linebackers so thats the kind of guy you love to have in front of you
5523937 with the new guy obviously hes got a whole different level of athleticism thats going to help him get a lot more involved in rushing the passer and making plays on the ball
5523938 we have high expectations for him but once you get into games and see how he performs the jurys still out
5523939 theres me in other words a woman theres obama in other words a black man and then theres john
5523940 similar to the sound you hear when you tread on a cats tail
5523941 the united states is one of the few countries that taxes on the basis of citizenship rather than residence
5523942 its what you pay literally for being a u s citizen
5523943 the game of billiards has destroyed my naturally sweet disposition
5523944 the flowers the gorgeous mystic multi colored flowers are not the flowers of life but people yes people are the true flowers of life and it has been a most precious pleasure to have temporarily strolled in your garden
5523945 if it wasnt for erica i wouldnt know just how evil i am
5523946 meeting erica was a party by itself theres nothing like a meeting of the minds sometimes you feel more at home with someone youve never seen before than with people who have been in the background for years
5523947 i think i should be very careful with what i say lest folks get the idear were lesbos or something

5523974 i guess if youre making 3 million a year youre middle class
5523975 youre promoting something we would be doing if we could afford it but we cant yet you expect us to have the same level of enthusiasm as you do
5523976 why arent you spending more time in paris now that you left the corporate rat race you should just go follow your dream think of yourself
5523977 i think perhaps we will need a stiff drink after that
5523978 i have in the last few months become more pessimistic than the consensus
5523979 im not someone who sees things in a bleak way
5523980 i have more concerns about potential risks and vulnerabilities than most people
5523981 its a mix of skills that rarely comes packaged in one person
5523982 im drawing on 20 years of accumulated experience using models
5523983 nouriel has a different way of seeing things than most economists he gets into everything
5523984 the most brilliant economist who never wrote down an equation
5523985 were in uncharted territory where standard economic theory isnt helpful
5523986 the justification for his bearish call has evolved over the years
5523987 this forecasting by analogy is a tempting thing to do
5523988 but you have to pick the right analogy the danger of this more subjective approach is that instead of letting the objective facts shape your views you will choose the facts that confirm your existing views
5523989 and youre asking whats the worst thing that could happen the first thing people will say is lets see what nouriel says
5523990 if the underlying conditions call for optimism nouriel would be optimistic
5523991 im not comfortable saying that were going to end up in the great depression
5523992 we are in a recession and denying it is nonsense
5523993 you either nationalize the banks or you nationalize the mortgages
5523994 reckless people have deluded themselves that this was a subprime crisis
5523995 but we have problems with credit card debt student loan debt auto loans commercial real estate loans home equity loans corporate debt and loans that financed leveraged buyouts
5523996 a good third of the regional banks wont make it
5523997 our biggest financiers are china russia and the gulf states
5523998 once you run current account deficits you depend on the kindness of strangers
5523999 this might be the beginning of the end of the american empire

5524036 there can be but one form of action for the recovery of any debt or the enforcement of any right secured by mortgage upon real property or an estate for years therein
5524037 i was digging around in the attic and i found all my grandmas old clothes from when she was a flapper in the twenties i thought my boyfriend would like it if i dressed up for him in costume i like to try new things so i dont get bored i thought maybe we could role play or something like i could be a cabaret dancer who wants a part in a show and my boyfriend is the director who says i can be the star as long as i fuck him hell have to make me the star of the show once i suck the first load out of his dick with my mouth and then squeeze the second one out with my cunny
5524038 i tend to get tired of doing the same old things during sex especially now that its summer break im home all day and theres not much else to do but fuck the hours away my boyfriend likes it though he says hes never been with a girl as freaky as me im all about trying new positions and toys and acting out our most secret fantasies
5524039 i like to try new things theres just something about the feeling of ice on my nipples that turns me on its so cold and im so hot it gives me goosebumps and its just this super intense sensation that makes me wanna reach down and touch myself
5524040 first a guy has to lick my pussy lightly and stick his finger in a little bit building me up until im super horny and begging for more
5524041 if were talking about sports what else would we be referring to
5524042 these guys they just came up to me and offered me a ride so i told them okay when we were in the car one of the cute guys pulled out his dick it was so big i started drooling
5524043 i love playing dress up i think its kinky to pretend im someone else and do a little role playing
5524044 okay so last time i told you this guy had put his pinkie in my butt
5524045 ill tell you whats gotten into me his big ol dick thats what i know everyone in school makes fun of the janitors but this guy is different hes buff young and has sexy tatoos i caught him peeking at me while i was peeing and it turned me on i figured he has a pretty crappy job so i should give him a perk
5524046 like i care they wish they were getting fucked as good as i am and by such a stud too even though this guy is the janitor ive seen the girls looking at him i know they have secret crushes on him i think i will tell them im fucking him theyll be soo jealous
5524047 when i first saw him he was so stiff and uptight i knew he wasnt getting any pussy from his wife
5524048 you know it i love the taste of cock and from what the guys tell me they love the feeling of my little tongue stud sliding up and down their prick i mean my blowjob skills were good before but now its crazy i can make a guy fall in love with me by the way i suck him off it can be nice and slow or fast and hard and i always give special attention to that sensitive spot right under the head i really enjoy sucking and licking balls too
5524049 i think im good at that too but i could always use more experience i learn something new from every guy i bang like last night i fucked this guy who showed me how to take a real deep dicking he told me to hold my breath and squeeze my pussy walls every time he thrust in ohmigod it felt so good i thought i was hallucinating i couldve sworn i had three orgasms at once
5524050 oh just licking it and sucking it im practicing my blowjob skills i want to give my boyfriend the best blowjob hes ever had and will ever have i asked a few girls for tips and they said to be careful with your teeth im also working on my gag reflex cause i know my boyfriend likes it when i suck really hard and take his tool deep into my mouth until it touches my tonsils he really starts to moan when i do that
5524051 he does a super job eating my pussy thats why i want to learn to give better head and he is an amazing fuck after hes done splitting my twat my legs are quivering and im out of breath not only is he huge but he really knows how to use his cock to make me moan scratch and cum
5524052 wow is it that obvious yes im a virgin sort of ive had sex with girls and we used dildos on each other but ive never had a real cock inside me one time i gave a guy a blowie and that was fun too the truth is i cant wait to fuck for the first time if its half as good as being screwed with a dildo ill love it my pussy is really tight though i hope i can handle it
5524053 like i said ive fooled around a lot with girls and boys and ive had my pussy licked tons of times even though im still a virgin i have a big sex drive and im very curious at night i stroke my cunt thinking about all the things id like to do and have done to me
5524054 yup i dont like too many tan lines and i like my tits to have a solid carmel color plus i love attention and when i tan topless at the beach i get plenty of it it turns me on to see the guys drooling i know the other girls are jealous that their boyfriends are staring at my tits and not paying any attention to them oh well if they knew how to take care of their men like i do they wouldnt have that problem dont hate bitches
5524055 i still love to watch guys squirm when i see little drops of pre cum oozing out of their dicks i know im doing a good job but even though im a tease i always deliver after the guy is all worked up ill relieve some of his stress by blowing his cock till it explodes
5524056 my pussy doesnt discriminate if you can make me cum i like you whether youre a boy or a girl yound or old but i have to say milfs know how to work it lake isnt the only lady ive been with i totally fucked my girlfriends mom once it was so scandalous but i wasnt about to give up the best pussy licking action ever just cause my friend wouldnt approve of it
5524057 its great i feel so liberated now i can stay out as late as i want listen to music as loudly as i want and fuck as many guys as i want before i was sneaking around cause of my parents but now i have all the freedom i need i can walk around naked and stuff my pussy in the kitchen like a thanksgiving turkey some people celebrate moving into their own place by throwing a house warming party well i am going to throw a fuck fest party in honor of my new apartment i bet a bunch of people will show up for that
5524058 really i think everyone should break in their new home by having an orgy i cant wait to do two people at once i dont care if its a guy and a girl two guys or two girls i just want to feel wet mouths all over my body the more the merrier who knows maybe ill have a foursome just the thought of it is making me hot i cant wait for the sex party
5524059 knew what that their daughter is an orgy loving ho bag he he theres a lot of things they dont know like that ive banged a handful of guys in the room next to them while they slept
5524060 i got a lot of tips from my older sister shes a ho and she loves to have sex so she gave me the horny bitchs guide to fucking its just a list of rules she and her friends made up but it has a lot of good information rule number one was thou shall fuck and cum as often as possible i was so happy when i read that cause im so horny i knew i wouldnt have trouble following that rule
5524061 mostly like common sense stuff but i guess if youre a prude or a virgin you wouldnt know but it says to always moan loudly and make sure you cum before the guy is done my favorite rule is thou shall masturbate in your free time that way you learn how you like to be fucked and you can impress the guy with your freakiness and sex knowledge
5524062 wow you guys cut right to the chase huh normally id say thats personal but since i am posing nude for a mag i guess theres no use in hiding it im a little turned on gosh i feel kind of embarrassed admitting that ive never really talked about that kind of stuff with anyone not even my girlfriends and they talk horny all the time
5524063 um no this is just the way i am ive never been with a guy before so im afraid if i start talking about sex ill sound stupid and everyone will know im a virgin i mean i do play with myself late at night when everyone is asleep it feels good but i wouldnt know where to start with the real thing ive never even seen a real live penis before so thats why im so shy
5524064 my parents gave it to me as a present for my 18th birthday im so excited about it im getting more attention from guys now cause i cruise around town with the top down i even drive places without any panties on so i can flash my coochie to guys looking down at me from their big trucks and suvs
5524065 how did you know it was this biker dude he was so hot he pulled up next to me at a light and we started flirting i told him to pull into this parking lot and leave his bike there so we could go for a ride and get to know each other i told him that i heard biker guys have real big dicks and i wanted to see if it was true well it was after seeing his meat i couldnt concentrate on driving and pulled over i just had to taste it so juicy and salty i was crazy horny by that point so i hopped on top of him in the passenger seat and rode his hog until he squealed from cumming
5524066 yeah guys seem to like it cause its easier for them to toss me around in different positions when were fooling around like i can ride a guy while he is standing and holding me up by my ass i also like to do 69 standing up hanging upside down with a big dick in my mouth is an intense experience luckily ive never been dropped
5524067 ive had sex before but im not a total ho ive been with like three guys and all three of them told me i was a really fun fuck cause im petite the only thing is that they cant stick their dick in too deep cause my pussy is short like the rest of me its all good though cause my sweet spot is easy to find and i cum really easily
5524068 i wasnt going to tell you this but what the hell im a squirter i discovered it before i popped my cherry i was mastrubating with a dildo and when i came i felt something squirt out of my pussy there was a huge wet spot on my bed i was kind of embarrassed so when i lost my virginity i made sure it was in a pool so the guy wouldnt notice me spraying he noticed it anyway cause i was so wet and slippery he told me that most guys like that so now i just let my juices flow all over the dick or tongue inside me
5524069 i was supposed to be meeting this guy out here at midnight but he never showed up can you believe the nerve of him im never sucking his dick again i put all this effort into picking out a cute outfit and preparing a late night snack for us this was supposed to be a romantic moonlight picnic we were going to fuck under the stars whatever i came prepared so it isnt like a total loss
5524070 if that guy doesnt want to fuck me then im going to fuck myself first with my fingers then with my dildo im so glad i brought it i would have liked a warm tongue or real dick but ill just have to settle for mastrubating ive never done it outside in the dark like this so thats kind of exciting the weather is perfect for rolling around naked and making my pussy wet
5524071 even though hes an asshole im going to think about what i wouldve done to my date first i would have unleashed his bulging boner from his jeans and swallowed it whole i wouldve bobbed and slobbed on his boner until he released hot spunk all over my face than with my panties still on id straddle him and bang him hard and fast with my tits in his face
5524072 i guess there are some guys who ask me out on dates but i dont really pay attention to them i dont like guys anyway i like men the guys my age dont know how to treat me or what to do with my body their pussy eating skills are terrible and some of them wont even go down yet they expect me to suck their thing thats not fair foreplay is important for me it gets my juices flowing and makes me even hornier so i dont mess with these little boys who are afraid to eat me out whats there to be afraid of i promise that my pussy is clean as a whistle and sweet as sugar
5524073 well yes my neighbor is in his early forties and things have happened between us i always had a crush on him and i would plot ways to get alone with him one day i purposely got really dirty while working in the garden and i told him i was locked out of my house and wanted to wash my hands he let me in and i went straight to the bathroom and stripped naked after i rinsed off i stepped out and asked him if hed like to join me
5524074 its great now i actually get excited when im carded cause im legal and all i have to do is whip out my i d i know i look kind of young but whatever at least when im an old lady ill look good for my age and just cause i have small tits and an innocent face doesnt mean im not a full grown woman im an adult and im ready to go wild and do big girl things like vote go to 18 dance clubs buy porn and fuck and suck lots of hot guys
5524075 hell yeah dont let my cute little panties fool you theres a seriously horny pussy hiding beneath this cotton im ready to break out and see the world so im checking out my map to see which city i should ravage first i want to try at least one cock in every state once im done doing america im going across the atlantic to the uk to see if the sausage is any better over there i cant wait to explore and to be explored who knows maybe ill even taste foreign vagina in my travels the possibilities are endless
5524076 i dont think ill miss this city so much as i will this one guy hes the one who i lost my virginity to after he popped my cherry i turned into a sex a holic and we would fuck every day in my bedroom i learned a lot like how to do deep throat without gagging i taught him a thing or two also like how to make a girl cum with your dick mmm weve had so many hot memories together
5524077 the beach as you can see i dont like tan lines so i go to a nude beach where i can be completely free im usually one of the younger people there so i get a lot of looks but i like that it turns me on im an exhibitionist at heart and when i know people are watching me i put on a show for them like at the beach ill peel my clothes and underwear off very slowly and then oil up my body from my tits to my ass to my puss jaws literally drop when i do that
5524078 oh yeah i love to pick the nerdy guys i think their shyness is a turn on this one time i waved over a total dweeb he was so cute though i asked him if he would put some tanning oil on my back and i could feel his fingers trembling as he did so i grabbed his hands and put them on my boobs i think he almost creamed himself it got me all hot and horny so i made him come in the water with me and touch my bald pussy i pressed my ass into his crotch and just as i suspected he had a huge hard on
5524079 oh theyd be super pissed but i dont care im too horny to abide by their stupid rules and if that means having my boyfriend come to my window at midnight so be it plus i kind of like being sneaky this way
5524080 i almost did once my boyfriend and i were fooling around in my room after he climbed through the window and i totally forgot to lock my door my mom walked in but it was so dark that she couldnt see well my boyfriend hid under the bed and she didnt suspect a thing ive been fucking under my parents noses for a long time and i know how to get away with this stuff plus that element of danger makes it more exciting when im screwing a guy i snuck in my room i tell him to cover my mouth tight so no moans come out of it
5524081 i go to an all girls school and the dress code is really strict we have to wear these itchy ugly uniforms my parents are really overprotective of me too and they dont like it when i wear tight clothes so after school i go to the bathroom and change so i can look sexy for my boyfriend he goes to a school nearby and picks me up in his camaro he says he already has a hot car and he wants his girlfriend to look just as hot so i put on my shortest skirt and highest heels it drives him crazy when i do that
5524082 yeah i fucked him the camaro is our special place for getting freaky i know im supposed to wait till marriage or some commitment but i dont even want to get married and i am not going to be a nun or anything i like my boyfriend and all but i get bored of the same dick over and over i cant wait to fuck as many guys as possible but i have the rest of my life to do that my boyfriend can make me cum so hell do for now
5524083 yeah and now i have so many dates i dont know what to do sure a lot of girls my age say that but the thing is i swing both ways so ive got twice the action coming at me being popular is awesome i fuckin rule the school
5524084 honestly i think i dream about girls more cause i always cum the best with them just last night i had a dream about doing 69 with this chick in my gym class it was so real i could almost taste her warm honey on my lips when i woke up my hands were working my clit
5524085 well first of all let me say that im still a virgin so i havent really gotten that freaky yet except with myself but if im making out with a boy or touching myself my favorite thing to listen to is marvin gaye especially his song lets get it on i may be young but i like the oldies i can relate to that song too like when he talks about holding back and wanting to let go ive been protective over my cherry but lately ive been wanting to pop it real bad does that make me a slut
5524086 im not a prude just cause im not being a ho doesnt mean that i dont get horny either i have a toy that i use on a regular basis i like to pretend when im using it that im practicing for real sex like ill get on all fours and stick it in from behind and pretend that a guy is doing me doggie style to tell you the truth i cant wait to try that position because im dying to find out how a real dick compares to my fake one
5524087 thanks well lets see i guess its pretty obvious that im a fan of sweets at first i just liked to eat candy and ice cream the regular way but now i prefer to lick them off body parts an ex boyfriend of mine got me into food play it started off with us getting into a food fight in his kitchen and after all that playing around we ended up fooling around on the floor since we were already covered in food i thought it would be fun to put whipped cream and chocolate syrup on his dick and lick it off like a banana sundae
5524088 yeah but that turns me on i like to get sticky and dirty whats the difference if its with sweat and cum or chocolate and sprinkles i think dick tastes good already but a little whipped cream doesnt hurt either way its going in my mouth
5524089 after shawn and i fucked that one day we just kept on fucking someone saw us on webcam and asked us to do a movie so we said yes right away khristina do you always get naked outside where everyone can see you
5524090 on those long lonely nights i would think of those scenes as i did myself with my favorite toy
5524091 worlds longest holocaust in the history of mankind and loss of human lives
5524092 the brownback legislation did not authorize or support any claims or settlements from indians or tribes against the united states campbell believes that any formal federal apology should not incorporate the words holocaust or genocide since he feels the processes of colonization were complex and that purposeful extermination of indians wasnt always the intent of early colonists he also notes that its easy to blame everything on europeans but the fact is that some of the bad things that were happening were here long before they got here the colorado resolution specifically mentions the forced removal of the cherokee nation in 1838 and the sand creek massacre of between 150 and 200 indian people composed of mostly elderly men women and children by members of the colorado territory militia in 1864 it also notes the many indian deaths due to disease that were magnified by european conquest
5524093 its a horrendous slap in the face after 120 years of injustice to have this kind of ruling come down
5524094 on the contrary and true to unpredictable form rather than squandering the opportunity orange nubuck on orange suede with a slightly off colour midsole and laces a pleasantly black lining plus embroidered details on the heel and art on the insole makes for a good look provided orange is your thing and for us it is
5524095 primary advisor to the secretary and the department on energy and technology policy development
5524096 i agree about the bit that if weve had manipulation from gold at 250 up to now then bring on more of it
5524097 dr bernadine healy is the former head of the national institutes of health and the most well known medical voice yet to break with her colleagues on the vaccine autism question
5524098 it is very very likely to happen before the end of the third quarter
5524099 without government help we think there is very little chance of freddie completing a significant capital raising
5524100 as the secretary has said we have no plans to use these authorities
5524101 they really are helping to pull the market down rather than being source of strength at this time
5524102 they are going to be pressed to raise capital in a very weak market which is going to make the cost of capital very high for both of these organizations
5524103 dr bernadine healy is the former head of the national institutes of health and the most well known medical voice yet to break with her colleagues on the vaccine autism question
5524104 i think its imperative that the following step be taken the president should have already and should do so very quickly convene the presidents working group on financial markets thats something that he can ask the secretary of the treasury to do this has to be coordinated across markets with the regulators here and obviously with regulators and central banks around the world
5524105 t he banking problems in the united states continue to mount while the federal governments deficit continues to soar out of control
5524106 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars
5524107 on july 16 2008 the federal reserve reported holding 2 349 billion of us government paper in custody for central banks in its report released today this amount had grown over the past three weeks to 2 401 billion a 38 4 annual rate of growth so central banks were accumulating dollars over the past three weeks at a rate far above what one would expect as a result of the us trade deficit the logical conclusion is that they were intervening in currency markets they were buying dollars for the purpose of propping it up to keep the dollar from falling off the edge of the cliff and doing so ignited a short covering rally which is not too difficult to do given the leverage employed in the markets these days by hedge funds and others
5524108 theres a crisis in the white house and to save the election theyd have to fake a war
5524109 what happened on the night of aug 7 is beyond comprehension the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity the georgian leadership could do this only with the perceived support and encouragement of a much more powerful force

5524111 washingtons bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of south ossetia georgia president mikhail saakashvili would never dream of launching a massive military attack unless he got explicit orders from his bosses at 1600 pennsylvania ave after all saakashvili owes his entire political career to american power brokers and us intelligence agencies if he disobeyed them hed be gone in a fortnight besides an operation like this takes months of planning and logistical support especially if its perfectly timed to coincide with the beginning of the olympic games another petty neocon touch that means pentagon planners must have been working hand in hand with georgian generals for months in advance nothing was left to chance

5524156 theres always been control systems for different facial movements but say in the past you had a dial for controlling whether an eye was open or closed and in one frame you set the eye at 3 4 open the next 1 2 open etc this is like achieving that degree of control with much finer movements
5524157 for instance you could be controlling the movement in the top 3 4mm of the right side of the smile

5524201 however the number of prosecutions of cases filed has only grown slightly because cases that could be filed are limited by the number of adas available to file them
5524202 in addition to the lack of funded positions the lack of pay progression for assistant district attorneys is resulting in alarming departures of experienced adas from state service in counties across the state
5524203 a high attrition rate among adas is creating a downward spiral of decreasing experience and efficiency in the states courthouses where the turnover rate amongst prosecutors has reached approximately 60 percent since 2001
5524204 there isnt any substitute for having those who have experience

5524227 for one thing the kernel is quite complex and big and it inevitably simply takes time to learn all the rules not just for the code but for how the whole development environment works similarly for a new developer it will take time before people start recognising the name and start trusting the developer to do the right things
5524228 we make it fairly easy for people to ease into kernel development
5524229 it seems to be working too we literally have thousands of people with patches attributed to them in each release
5524230 the worst thing anybody can do is to study the kernel alone and try to learn things in private and then however many months later present all the established kernel developers with a big patch that just comes out of the blue
5524231 it may not sound exciting but quite frankly i dont think anybody who starts out believing that they want to rewrite some big piece of the kernel should even bother reality isnt that simple
5524232 of course some people will be alienated and theres no doubt that the process could probably be improved
5524233 not a warm and fuzzy environment where people sing kumbaya around the fireplace
5524234 the kernel is about pretty harsh technical issues and mistakes are really frowned upon
5524235 in an os kernel there are simply more security and stability requirements and the bar is really higher in some respects that will inevitably also reflect in the response to patches
5524236 i think that one of the things weve been very good at is to scale up with a good network of maintainers so that most people involved actually dont work closely with more than a handful of people

5524257 the project was born out of an observation that while concepts like community and immediacy are often central to the rhetoric surrounding theater and performance art the lifestyles of people working in those fields are often particularly itinerant and their important relationships are increasingly maintained through electronic media across vast distances the near far seeks to explore this paradox both in the form of the collaboration itself and in the chosen themes around which the project was built
5524258 dado que la demanda est creciendo y ya hay pedidos de suministro de gas natural para el 2010 del orden de 600 millones de pies c bicos estamos conversando con el gobierno para ampliar el ducto a 1 000 millones de pies c bicos entre los a os 2012 y 2014

5524260 el nivel de contratos que hab a con tgp en esa poca era muy bajo y muy inferior respecto a la capacidad actual del transporte del sistema por eso en coordinaci n con el mem decidimos adelantar la ampliaci n del sistema de transporte

5524334 i continue to believe that we must do the research that would be conducted at the proposed facility to protect public health and our food supply whether at the current location at plum island or elsewhere and that wherever the research is done it must be done safely
5524335 in 1948 congress made it illegal for a facility such as nbaf to study biological contagions like foot and mouth disease that could spread from animals to humans in the continental united states since then this work has been done on plum island to help limit any outbreaks to the general population from accidental releases that would inevitably occur
5524336 congressman price spoke at a meeting in durham on june 16 2008 which i attended where he said neither he nor anyone else should make rash decisions about nbaf either way
5524337 i would like to ask him why then did he vote just two days later to circumvent the 1948 law and clear the way for homeland security to bring the lab to north carolina he has also openly supported nbaf to his constituents plainly the only people who want this facility are special and corporate interests the people of granville and durham dont want it and even the democratic party of orange county is against it also recently his colleague congressman brad miller has withdrawn his support
5524338 now price says he is neutral on nbaf but what does that mean does neutral mean that he supports it but does not want the voters in his district to know that he supports it in an election year
5524339 i am not the only one asking here but would the real congressman price please stand up and tell us if he supports nbaf or not the voters of the 4th district have a right to know where congressman price truly stands on this issue
5524340 now price says he is neutral on nbaf but what does that mean does neutral mean that he supports it but does not want the voters in his district to know that he supports it in an election year

5524513 you can see into the future and transport your visions through touch
5524514 its another old dirigeant power ive never met someone who could do it
5524515 ello um kasey i think we better leave for 3 rd period
5524516 nick said it was an old dirigeant power he can read minds tabby
5524517 do you feel out of your body do you feel any odd or misplaced feelings
5524518 um kinda i feel scared and dread even though i dont personally feel them but i feel in my body does that make since
5524519 in this situation it makes since you and her have been emotionally bonded this is rare but heard of among close legacies bonds have been formed when in complete control it allows you to see through the others eyes feel what the other feels and pass thoughts back and forth
5524520 the bonded twos initials are then burned into the others palms very painful usually but not enough to cause a black out any unusual things happen that have you on edge
5524521 other than the fact that up until today i had no idea i was a legacy i had no idea i was a dirigeant i had no idea i would kiss the ass of both my brother and his best friend danny and dougie both mumbled at this moment oh and the fact that i am having visions of the future and i can pass them to others by touching them nope nothing
5524522 im going to close my eyes and pretend i can
5524523 it was funny though danny and dougie have a fan club
5524524 well i was listening to their new song and the chick next to me heard it
5524525 uh laura well be right back we need to find our brothers
5524526 dont lie i just wanna know i mean you knew all about my danny obsession but you never said anything about liking doug
5524527 eyup tabitha mum stopped by for a visit come down
5524528 father isnt pleased with their powers he said it will affect you taking you right full place
5524529 those two girls are no threat they didnt ever know what they were until a two weeks ago my powers are more developed
5524530 yes but the other one cant and they tell each other everything whatever tabitha think and feels thanks to their bond i will know through kasey
5524531 father will not take that as an answer he will wont them completely out of the way they still dont know the extent of what they are they dont know the power they hold when they find out it wont be so easy to rid of them father will want to dispose of them soon
5524532 i completely distracted you until we could get up here and away from them you didnt think about the vision so he couldnt see it
5524533 you have to be very careful and keep that out of your mind when he is near
5524534 a sensible government should help to create a skilled workforce and a decent business climate if it does that the jobs will take care of themselves
5524535 now i know why she loves it here so much and why shes so happy here
5524536 someday he will wake up and realize what a treasure he has in you you wait and see
5524537 how long have you had that phone 10 years that was one of our first editions
5524538 minhas fei es se formam com a mudan a do clima
5524539 we all committ certain acts in our lives of an unsavory nature
5524540 and the capability of all three branches of government to execute constitutional responsibilities and provide for orderly succession appropriate transition of leadership
5524541 our veterans have answered their countrys call to duty representing americas unswerving commitment to individual human rights and dignity
5524542 i have to tell you the men and women of todays armed forces remain just as dedicated and committed to the ideals of our country as their predecessors
5524543 todays airmen soldiers sailors and marines are making tremendous contributions to our national defense from defending the skies above our homeland to capturing insurgents in iraq and afghanistan
5524544 this is much appreciated by our men and women in uniform
5524545 the exchange of information occurred in real time over a distance of 7 000 miles thanks to those satellites overhead
5524546 it is a great example of how joint teams spanning multiple military units time zones and command and control centers can achieve tremendous accomplishments
5524547 every day americas airmen integrate air space and cyberspace capabilities into the joint fight demonstrating their flexibility throughout
5524548 over 100 000 airmen have known the strain of multiple deployments
5524549 she not only accomplished her mission as a combat photographer but she also fulfilled her duties as an american airman and warrior
5524550 as she put it i was just doing my job
5524551 today we often are able to move injured warriors from theater to the united states in three days or less
5524552 additionally with advances in medical technology and operational effectiveness we are witnessing unprecedented survival rates and the lowest disease non battle injury and died of wounds rates of any conflict in u s history
5524553 during desert storm in the early 1990s for example the time sensitive targeting process could take days and during operations in the balkans during the mid to late 1990s it was reduced to hours
5524554 now in iraq and afghanistan the joint team is completing the kill chain within a few minutes
5524555 no matter how many or how few nuclear weapons we have in our arsenal the air force will remain vigilant
5524556 we have at least two constants the high quality of the airmen attracted to military service and our commitment to the core values of integrity first service before self and excellence in all we do
5524557 on behalf of the air force thank you for all you do to support todays young warriors as they defend the united states and its global interests ensuring stability and prosperity across the global commons it has been an honor to be with you today
5524558 our inspections have declined over the years and so has our focus we must regain confidence that the u s air force will safeguard our nations nuclear weapons
5524559 we need to make sure the american public knows weve got the stick
5524560 its a love and hate relationship the enemy hates the way we live and we love our freedoms
5524561 we must adapt and work more closely in the joint community
5524562 all the services working together make us all more efficient and effective
5524563 we need to keep the war on terrorism on their 2 yard line not ours
5524564 its going to be a long war on more than one front
5524565 we are fighting for our children our grandchildren and our entire way of life
5524566 this leaves about 15 percent of the population for us to recruit from
5524567 the average age of air force aircraft is 24 years old
5524568 we have to focus on the current war but at the same time plan for the next one
5524569 we didnt really benefit from the gains of current force shaping cutbacks because of skyrocketing fuel costs and other factors
5524570 better acquisition processes and use of resources will be key to continued recapitalization
5524571 it is important that the air force be responsible with taxpayers money
5524572 we have great professionals working air force acquisitions to meet all our requirements
5524573 i have tremendous faith in the experts we have working this program
5524574 what does it take to be the chief master sergeant of the air force
5524575 we owe it to every airman in the air force to do the quality assurance to ensure when you buy a uniform off the shelf we have it right
5524576 be fit know when to push away from the table
5524577 it was never my goal to be the chief master sergeant of the air force
5524578 i was a crew chief doing my job i became a first sergeant because i want to take care of people i have always concentrated on doing the best job i can whatever the job was and let leadership decide where i go next
5524579 there are a number of us who are private pilots who still get flying time in some way
5524580 we know that predator is critical to the nations defense
5524581 so its not a one way door that you go into predator and thats where you are for the rest of your career
5524582 you go down the list and everyone has a different reason for it
5524583 maybe they wanted to be closer to home yet still serve in the warfight
5524584 i fly commercially on the outside so this is the opportunity to do a mission that affects whats going on with the war every day but i still get to fly
5524585 we just got back from operation iraqi freedom doing close air support with the f 16 now we are going to do the same mission with the mq 9
5524586 looking from our perspective its really essential for the initial cadre to come from a background where they are familiar with the mission
5524587 the seasoned aviators are the people the guard brings to this fight and are exactly the people needed in the predator
5524588 not just tactically but in the flying sense the more seasoned the better
5524589 conr serves as part of a layered defense that protects our national airspace every day so these are core missions that we and our federal partners are undertaking to support our national conventions
5524590 its a noble duty to be able to protect these events as our citizens participate in the traditional democratic processes that define us as americans
5524591 something like this fire hasnt been seen on an air force base before
5524592 knowing that they were all unoccupied houses made our job a bit easier so we could focus on preventing embers from hitting the occupied houses
5524593 the fire was the worst case scenario in many ways because of the high winds and the length of time the homes had been abandoned they became tinder boxes
5524594 so we worked to get the fire in the unoccupied houses out before it got to the occupied homes the guys did a tremendous job out there
5524595 first there is the incredible teamwork we share with the on base fire department
5524596 second was the proactive weed abatement measures the base has in place to keep the undergrowth cut back that prevented the fire from spreading further than it did
5524597 we were hooked up to a hydrant and stood by to make sure embers didnt reach the center
5524598 we had units all around the perimeter of the fire you looked to your right and your left and all you could see was fire
5524599 you couldnt see five feet in front of you but its what we train for all the time training for the big time
5524600 our on base firefighters were joined by our emergency response partners from fairfield vacaville suisun dixon cordelia benicia montezuma cal state as well as several units from napa and yolo counties to prevent a potential disaster
5524601 we have such a wonderful mutual aid partnership with our local partners these assets made it possible to effectively fight the fire
5524602 in addition we also had security forces and medical helping out to make sure everyone was safe and healthy
5524603 this fire turned into a huge win not only for travis afb but also for our partners in the local communities as well
5524604 the combined efforts of all firefighters involved prevented a serious disaster from spreading further
5524605 mcintire has a particularly broad background combining economics public policy and elective experience mcintire has a doctorate in economics teaches at the university of washingtons evans school of public affairs and has dealt with numerous fiscal policy questions as an academic an adviser to officials and since 1998 a state representative he is chairman of the state economic and revenue forecast council and previously chaired the house finance committee mcintire wants to be a treasurer who works with other officials to make sure the state addresses its needs in such areas as transportation higher education and public schools washington would be well served by that kind of informed strong leadership
5524606 what did bush know and when did he know it
5524607 maybe i can find out something about the a couple days go by then over dinner she gives me the news
5524608 theres not much out there about baseball in a few people have heard about it but no one thinks much of it
5524609 oh thats the chinese team theyre usually there but i guess theyre off today
5524610 keep your shoulder in you wanna look away and adjust in
5524611 theres a couple wang weis got a major league arm behind the plate and he can hit hes smart he has all the intangibles
5524612 hey todays japan mexico game is on espn deportes whats this deportes stuff your satellite doesnt get it were gonna miss the game
5524613 maybe we oughta just go to the game s not that far could be very cool
5524614 man the trains empty theres seats galore ichiro steps in locks his bat samurai style
5524615 i cannot understand how this could happen in mexico the same umpire let the americans off the hook again by changing a mexican players homerun a ball that clearly ricocheted off the right field foul pole to a ground rule double
5524616 there is no evidence of vote theft or errors on a large scale
5524617 we didnt have fifty elections we actually had 13 000 elections run by 13 000 independent quasi sovereign counties and municipalities
5524618 people waiting in line for twelve hours to cast their ballots people not being allowed to vote because they were in the wrong precinct it was an outrage in you had a secretary of state who was determined to guarantee a republican outcome im terribly disheartened
5524619 you look at the turnout and votes in individual precincts compared to the historic patterns in those counties and you can tell where the discrepancies are they stand out like a sore thumb
5524620 that they are used as guides to the relative honesty of elections in in 2003 vote tampering revealed by exit polling in the forced eduard shevardnadze to step down
5524621 the people who ran the exit polling and all those of us who were their clients recognized that it was deeply flawed
5524622 they were really screwed up the old models just dont work anymore i would not go on the air with them again
5524623 either the exit polls by and large are completely wrong
5524624 as much as we can say in sound science that something is impossible
5524625 it is impossible that the discrepancies between predicted and actual vote count in the three critical battleground states of the 2004 election could have been due to chance or random error
5524626 im a survey expert i got into this because i was mystified about how the exit polls could have been so wrong
5524627 it is difficult to pinpoint precisely the reasons that in general kerry voters were more likely to participate in the exit polls than bush voters
5524628 the data presented to support the claim not only fails to substantiate it
5524629 when you look at the numbers there is a tremendous amount of data that supports the supposition of election fraud
5524630 the discrepancies are higher in battleground states higher where there were republican governors higher in states with greater proportions of african american communities and higher in states where there were the most election day complaints all these are strong indicators of fraud and yet this supposition has been utterly ignored by the press and oddly by the democratic party
5524631 are consistent with the hypothesis that kerry would have won
5524632 the secretary of state is supposed to administer elections not throw them
5524633 the election in in 2004 stands out as an example of how under color of law a state election official can frustrate the exercise of the right to vote
5524634 caused by intentional misconduct and illegal behavior much of it involving secretary of state j
5524635 he saw his role as limiting the participation of democratic voters we had hearings in for two days we could have stayed two weeks the level of fury was so high thousands of people wanted to testify nothing like this had ever happened to them before
5524636 the democrats have been beating the pants off us in the air and on the ground
5524637 im afraid this is going to scare these people half to death and they are never going to show up on election day
5524638 many of them are young people who have registered for the first time
5524639 constitutional right to due process and constitutional right to vote
5524640 precincts where minority voters predominate interfering with and discouraging voters from voting in those districts
5524641 using pay phones to make intimidating calls to likely voters
5524642 the postal service had recommended to us that we establish a heavy enough paper weight standard that we not disenfranchise voters by having their registration form damaged by postal equipment
5524643 is not material in determining whether such individual is qualified under state law to vote
5524644 provisional ballots were supposed to be this great movement forward
5524645 but then different states erected barriers and this new right became totally eviscerated
5524646 by not even mentioning this group the primary beneficiaries of havas provisional voting provisions blackwell apparently seeks to accomplish the same result in ohio in 2004 that occurred in florida in 2000
5524647 if we had allowed this notion of voters without borders to exist
5524648 the purpose of provisional ballots is to not turn anyone away from the polls
5524649 misallocation of machines went beyond urban suburban discrepancies to specifically target democratic areas
5524650 on election day the county experienced an unprecedented turnout that could only be compared to a 500 year flood
5524651 the allocation of voting machines in franklin county was clearly biased against voters in precincts with high proportions of african americans
5524652 there are three voting machines at this precinct i have been informed that in prior elections there were normally four voting machines at there are approximately eighty five voters in line at this time the line to vote is approximately three hours long this precinct is largely african american i have personally witnessed voters leaving the polling place without voting due to the length of the line
5524653 i am serving as a presiding judge a position i have held for some 15 years in precinct 40
5524654 i observed a broken voting machine that was not in use for approximately two hours the precinct judge was very diligent but could not get through to the boe
5524655 there exists an enormous risk of chaos delay intimidation and pandemonium inside the polls and in the lines out the doors
5524656 that the elected officials and numerous election volunteers on the ground will carry out their responsibilities in a way that will enable qualified voters to cast their ballots
5524657 it appears that hundreds if not thousands of votes intended to be cast for senator kerry were recorded as being for a third party candidate
5524658 that just doesnt happen the question is where did the votes for kerry go
5524659 this is very strong evidence that the count is off in those counties
5524660 by itself without anything else what happened in these twelve counties turns into a kerry state to me this provides every indication of fraud
5524661 it is impossible to rule out the possibility that some sort of manipulation of the tallies occurred on election night in the locked down facility
5524662 they screwed with the process and increased the probability if not the certainty that there would not be a full countywide hand count
5524663 the count would come out perfect and we wouldnt have to do a full hand recount of the county
5524664 weve got a media that uses its bullhorn in reverse to turn down the volume on this outrage rather than turning it up thats why our citizens are not up in arms
5524665 i was a sports reporter so i was used to dealing with numbers
5524666 and the numbers made no sense kerry had an insurmountable lead in the exit polls on election night and then everything flipped
5524667 i was stunned by the lack of interest by investigative reporters
5524668 the republicans shut down allegedly for national security purposes and no one covered it shouldnt someone have sent a camera and a few reporters out there
5524669 you can rock the boat but you can never say that the entire ocean is in trouble
5524670 you cannot say by the way theres something wrong with our electoral system
5524671 there has been no oversight over our nations most basic right the right to vote how can we call ourselves a beacon of democracy abroad when the right to vote hasnt been secured in free and fair elections at home
5524672 can i draw a conclusion that they played tough games and clearly had an intent to reduce the level of our vote yes absolutely can i tell you to a certainty that it made the difference in the election i cant theres no way for me to do that if i could have done that then obviously i would have found some legal recourse
5524673 i think there are clearly states where it is questionable whether everybodys vote is being counted whether everybody is being given the opportunity to register and to vote
5524674 there are clearly barriers in too many places to the ability of people to exercise their full franchise
5524675 im not confident that the election in was fairly decided
5524676 we know that there was substantial voter suppression and the machines were not reliable it should not be a surprise that the republicans are willing to do things that are unethical to manipulate elections thats what we suspect has happened and wed like to safeguard our elections so that democracy can still be counted on to work
5524677 the real reason there is no appetite up here is that people are afraid the republicans will amend hava and shove something far worse down our throats
5524678 why erect those kinds of hurdles unless youre afraid of voters
5524679 the country will be better off if everyone votes democrats and republicans but that is not the blackwell philosophy that is not the george w bush or jeb bush philosophy they want to limit the franchise and go to extraordinary lengths to make it more difficult to vote

5524710 it doesnt make you feel good when you know youre letting the team down

5524724 the united states europe and all other concerned countries must stand united in condemning this aggression and seeking a peaceful resolution to this crisis
5524725 we should continue to push for a united nations security council resolution calling for an immediate end to the violence this is a clear violation of the sovereignty and internationally recognized borders of georgia the u n must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world
5524726 u n mediators cant even protect the dissident monks of burma or the opposition in zimbabwe let alone a small country trying to fight off single handed an invasion by the russian army
5524727 immediately and unconditionally cease military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory the consequences of euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5524728 u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce organization for security and cooperation in europe to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
5524729 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
5524730 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world

5524779 the next day i started to call the consulate the embassy i called the state department in america i called this woman that my children had given me the phone number of who was with the world bank and basically everyone told me the same thing you no longer have any rights to your children you are under islamic law there are no reciprocal agreements there is absolutely nothing you can do
5524780 people in the middle east are either born as an oppressor or they were born to be oppressed the only way to make change was to embarrass her country and its laws the only way to change our laws is through retention from outsiders now that they know outsiders are watching jordan wants to appear progressive thats why i wanted to meet you deborah so that you can be our messenger

5524793 todays warsaw is a communist state a socialist one where 90 of the land is state property theres not such a case in the whole of europe
5524794 the belief is that the compensation will go to the jews which much of polish opinion doesnt want the anti semitic motivation is strong enough to paint the whole issue as a jewish extortion from the polish state

5525089 investors have been trying to put the housing and credit crisis behind them
5525090 but every time news like this comes up they have to readjust their thinking
5525091 the oil price is very important and is indeed part of the reason why weve seen investor sentiment look a bit stronger over the course of the last few weeks
5525092 short term it is still a pretty negative picture of slowing economic growth which continues to be a factor
5525093 you have stocks selling off and concerns continuing about the health of financial companies and this stokes the flight to quality bid for treasuries

5525140 we are determined to continue our cooperation in fighting terrorism and extremism which pose challenges to both countries
5525141 russia hopes the departure of pakistani president pervez musharraf will not have negative consequences for the internal political stability of this major asian nation
5525142 but reform depends above all on legitimacy and that is why the united kingdom has been at pains to stress the importance for pakistan of strong institutions rather than strong individuals and why we believe a strong democracy is key
5525143 i look forward to the early election of a new president in pakistan to take forward the important shared work that binds our two countries together
5525144 we would like the next president and the pakistani government to work together in a constructive climate and with respect for the institutions to address the many challenges facing pakistan

5525153 let me tell you something tom something that has helped me keep a good perspective on my own priorities
5525154 you see i sat down one day and did a little arithmetic the average person lives about seventy five years i know some live more and some live less but on average folks live about seventy five years
5525155 now then i multiplied 75 times 52 and i came up with 3900 which is the number of saturdays that the average person has in their entire lifetime now stick with me tom im getting to the important part
5525156 it took me until i was fifty five years old to think about all this in any detail
5525157 and by that time i had lived through over twenty eight hundred saturdays i got to thinking that if i lived to be seventy five i only had about a thousand of them left to enjoy
5525158 so i went to a toy store and bought every single marble they had i ended up having to visit three toy stores to round up 1000 marbles i took them home and put them inside of a large clear plastic container right here in the shack next to my gear
5525159 every saturday since then i have taken one marble out and thrown it away
5525160 i found that by watching the marbles diminish i focused more on the really important things in life there is nothing like watching your time here on this earth run out to help get your priorities straight
5525161 now let me tell you one last thing before i sign off with you and take my lovely wife out for breakfast this morning i took the very last marble out of the container i figure if i make it until next saturday then i have been given a little extra time and the one thing we can all use is a little more time
5525162 it was nice to meet you tom i hope you spend more time with your family and i hope to meet you again here on the band 73 old man this is k9nzq clear and going qrt good morning
5525163 cmon honey im taking you and the kids to breakfast
5525164 oh nothing special its just been a long time since we spent a saturday together with the kids hey can we stop at a toy store while were out i need to buy some marbles

5525184 would not take any move to save the poor market
5525185 so far the burden has all been on companies because theres so much overcapacity no one has any room to pass on the costs
5525186 we are starting to see companies going out of business after six to 12 months the survivors will have less competition and be able to raise prices more but its a very slow gradual process
5525187 all of the indicators this year have been within expectations the economy has slowed down to prevent inflation
5525188 the spending numbers have been quite good recently but it could be because of the olympics
5525189 it seems hard to me to say that we wont see some sort of short term hangover at least
5525190 no that isnt the worst that could happen lets say 2 years into your 5 year cd the bank goes under and in the time since you bought your cd at 6 rates have dropped to 3 reinvestment risk
5525191 investors have been trying to put the housing and credit crisis behind them
5525192 but every time news like this comes up they have to readjust their thinking
5525193 the oil price is very important and is indeed part of the reason why weve seen investor sentiment look a bit stronger over the course of the last few weeks
5525194 short term it is still a pretty negative picture of slowing economic growth which continues to be a factor
5525195 the storm is largely irrelevant there is no shortage of refinery capacity in the united states even if it were to damage one of the refineries

5525201 if you pay young poor women to have children guess what they re going to have more children
5525202 government intervention always adversely affects someone while rarely trully benefiting those claimed to have benefited
5525203 i think it does make sense to give first time home buyers a break in the down payment requirement
5525204 i suppose the fha could come out with an interest only or option arm mortgage but that just seems crazy
5525205 some people say that mortgage lending is discriminatory against certain racial or ethnic groups and that easier credit terms need to be made available to these groups to combat a history of discrimination but i ve never bought this argument
5525206 fico scores and incomes are color blind and do not discriminate and banks will lend to whoever makes them money
5525207 dont think we will be able to say the same thing about the average american who thought they were finally given the chance to achieve the american dream
5525208 it s not money that is lacking in this society it s compassion

5525213 most people that bought during the bubble bought it for the percieved appreciation
5525214 what i find funny is that when prices were going up and people were flipping houses left and right most of us hated the speculators and felt that houses weren t stock but actually places to live in yet on the way down you are advocating treating the house like stock and putting a stop loss
5525215 in mine 50k has compounding interest and turns into alot more money 35 years down the road when you retire
5525216 the asking price is only 20 off the peak so they will likely have to discount this another 5 to 10 to attract a knife catcher this will likely bottom between 290 000 and 320 000 it is only two bedrooms so it may go lower
5525217 the company hired to manage the home and sell it the bearing group boarded up the home only to find the boards stolen and used to board up another abandoned home nearby
5525218 there are many reos that are not listed yet and these will hit the market eventually the lenders would have been better served selling them this summer when there was some volume now many of these will hit in the fall and winter when few buyers are around since this is must sell inventory it will push prices lower
5525219 back during the savings and loan crisis most of the reo s never hit the public resale market
5525220 lost sovereignity oil rich fund eyeing foreclosed us homes by teri buhl august 10 2008 theres a new land grab starting in america foreign money which up to now has focused its attention on investing in iconic commercial real estate like barneys new york and the chrysler building is now moving to scoop up tens of thousands of discounted foreclosed homes across the country
5525221 bottom line is that the banks aren t going to put all these reo s on the market and drive prices down causing even more foreclosures they are going to sell them in bulk and have them effectively taken out of inventory
5525222 nobody wants to lose money when they sell their house many of the sellers we have seen to date put no money down so they were not losing any money only their credit score
5525223 some lenders are reporting short sales as settled meaning they agreed to accept an amount less than what was owed while some are reporting them as paid a settled account on a credit report will impact a credit score negatively however a paid status will simply appear as though the mortgage was paid in other words some consumers who put no money down may not lose anything other than their home
5525224 i met them during a spring brake in europe i said to my self there is no work anyway so i will go and travel a little bit i think its the best vacation i ever had and its still continuing the only difference is that now im actually making money

5525234 our experience is that sharing waters are more commonly a point of cooperation rather than conflict and we will continue to work in this area given the increasing demand for water
5525235 this essential treaty has been stalled for more than a decade largely due to the failure of nations in not signing up to what they long ago agreed to
5525236 most of the worlds trans boundary river basins lack adequate legal protection and the world needs a global framework for sustainably managing and preventing disputes over those resources this is the only such framework available in the timescale to help us deal with a growing water crisis
5525237 take ethiopia and egypt which have negotiated trade agreements following the nile basin initiative
5525238 now some of the poorest countries in africa which border the river nile cooperate on managing the water resources in turn contributing to peace and stability economic growth and tackling climate change this is a result of recognising a common not conflicting resource
5525239 the experts are telling us that rivalries over water will be a significant source of future conflict as indeed they already are
5525240 the danger is that once mr musharraf has gone and it has no common hatred to

5525247 we regret that formal consultations have not been successful in resolving our concerns over the duties that the eu is imposing on several high tech products
5525248 we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector
5525249 is not something we can negotiate bilaterally with the united states
5525250 in effect the eu is taxing innovation a move that could impair continued technological development in the information technology industry and raise prices for millions of businesses and consumers

5525265 mortgages are down pretty sharply today it seems pretty clear that somehow theyve got to get more capital
5525266 to me it seems like the only end game is for the government to step in even though they said today they have no intention
5525267 i dont know if they wait for the equities to hit some price before they step in at some point theres nothing left
5525268 when the government steps in i would look at ginnie mae as the model they would work toward its a wrapper it doesnt have a portfolio
5525269 were looking at the 200 day moving average which stands at 110 27 its in the neighborhood its looking like its a major breaking point
5525270 if we break through it it could sell off considerably or if it holds we could bounce the other way
5525271 you saw fannie and freddie go down about 20 percent you saw spillover in the options market volatility and you saw a spike up in the vix i would have expected it to get to 24 or 25
5525272 we saw 7 to 10 percent moves pretty consistently in early july but since we had an uptrend in the market and the volatility has come down
5525273 omg edward you glitter in the sun just like mary kate amp ashley all over shimmering color
5525274 close you eyes and tap your heels together three times and think to yourself theres no place like home

5525278 i go downtown and park in a ramp on 9th and chicago the ramp leads me into an empty and closed hospital building it is beautifully eerie i leave the building and find myself in a little corner of downtown that im not familiar with it is sunny and temperate outside with a warmish downtown breeze which vaguely smells of that comforting and alarming hospital smell i can hear a soothing and enormous black mans voice booming on a microphone down the block coming from a park i think he is giving an outdoor sermon the streets are mostly empty here and i get this lovely feeling in my bones it feels a little like last summer in brooklyn when i was wandering alone in strange neighborhoods being the fetal version of the woman that i turned into this year that is the woman that loves to be alone

5525280 the dates will be aug 14 27 for our 60th anniversary edition and we are in the process of coming up with many ideas to celebrate the occasion
5525281 we had six days in which attendance was good and we had three days in which attendance wasnt so good but we were very pleased with the overall turnout
5525282 the daily sea lion splash and the closing freestyle motocross jump off were the two most popular attractions with large crowds turning out for them
5525283 when you look at it the cost of safety has no limit
5525284 folks need to be safe going in and they need to be safe while they are there
5525285 very concerned about liu xiangs injury and hopes he will receive swift treatment and soon heal
5525286 everyone will understand why liu xiang had to abandon competition due to injury and we hope he will cast aside mental burdens and settle his mind on overcoming injury
5525287 lift your fighting spirit and seek to win greater honor for the motherland
5525288 they also have a user thats a little older and a little more sophisticated
5525289 most disturbing is that apparently the police simply destroyed all the carts and all the contents without involving that crazy little creation we have here in the united states called the justice system

5525291 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5525292 a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated
5525293 level of objectivity has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5525294 with all due respect to the campaign leadership they are viewing our coverage through a political prism
5525295 we stand by our reporting our journalism and our journalists
5525296 you know long waits for health care and some services not even available
5525297 whoever the next president is health care should be at the top of his agenda bring everyone to the table and make it happen
5525298 cancer is a grumpy secretive passive aggressive grudge hoarder with bipolar mood swings and a positive genius for pointless worrying
5525299 you can only really relate to someone if you feel needed
5525300 bosses like you because you work hard you work harder and longer than anyone else because then you can feel hard done by and can bewail your sorry lot in life you also like a job for which you are overqualified so that you can feel superior and tell everybody else what to do
5525301 your home is full of stuff you keep everything clutter is your forte you often share your home with the destitute misfits and refugees not because you particularly care for them but because you simply dont notice them hanging around amidst all your stuff
5525302 well we use the kinds of curse words you use like ha ha ha ehmygawd i just did like the first twenty thousand steps and now its all screwed up well class is almost over so i might as well just not start the very new equation hello world
5525303 at present one man is confirmed dead at the scene and another two people have been seriously injured
5525304 a further 44 walking wounded patients have been taken to the medical centre at alton towers and are being treated by medical staff and doctors
5525305 it does not take a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men
5525306 if ever a time should come when vain and aspiring men shall possess the highest seats in government our country will stand in need of its experienced patriots to prevent its ruin
5525307 atheism christianity has been specially advanced through the loving service rendered to strangers and through their care for the burial of the dead it is a scandal that there is not a single jew who is a beggar and that the godless galileans care not only for their own poor but for ours as well while those who belong to us look in vain for the help that we should render them
5525308 use of a collective voice that embraced black and white concerns

5525314 the world has seen that even today there are political morons who are ready to kill innocent and defenseless people in order to satisfy their self serving interests while compensating for their own inability to resolve complicated issues by using the most terrible solution by exterminating an entire people
5525315 i think that there should be no mercy for that we will do our best not to let this crime go unpunished
5525316 you just dont move more than 1 200 tanks and 15 000 soldiers into a country within 12 hours without previous planning

5525328 we are making progress in the offensive line and are close to having our starting five
5525329 they have been blocking against a pretty good defense vic koenning defensive coordinator throws multiple fronts against them so it has given them a good luck at a good defense we will see what comes out of the scrimmage on tuesday
5525330 we will meet as a staff all day wednesday we wont practice that day because it is the first day of class but we will go over personnel talk about which players to red shirt and who gives us the best chance to win at each position
5525331 it is not that jimmy maners has been doing poorly the other guys are just pushing him it is a three person battle right now between jimmy maners richard jackson and dawson zimmerman jackson has really come on of late and is in the mix
5525332 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5525333 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5525334 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5525335 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5525336 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5525337 placed its whole case for murder on a 16 year old who had consumed 80 ounces of malt liquor who had a view from a darkened park across a darkened roadway

5525339 isnt it a little late for you to be out
5525340 we made up a plan that we were going to tell the cops that nobody kicked him that there were no racial slurs there was no booze and brian got hit first

5525351 the whole world knows al bachir as a risk taker
5525352 traveling to turkey in the face of ongoing icc arrest warrant being issued while he is in istanbul could be one of the greatest risks he has ever taken in life
5525353 reject efforts by sudans president to secure a suspension of the icc investigation against him turkey should also convey a clear message that khartoum must not respond to the investigation with retaliation against civilians peacekeepers or humanitarian workers
5525354 the most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love and to let love come in
5525355 i just cant believe i ever shopped for converse shoes elsewhere
5525356 we are all just human beings who want to feel good about what we do
5525357 you would relive scenes from the colosseum from ancient rome gladiators or maybe julius caesar or other things
5525358 as an industry we cannot let automotive suppliers the very backbone of this business collapse at a time when the industry needs us most
5525359 carter told the management briefing seminars in traverse city last week
5525360 one thing at a time just one thing at a time
5525361 okay people spare me the you had this coming god used this guy to bring judgment on those crazy liberals or even that this guy is gods hammer
5525362 he has shown you what is good and is required of you do justly love mercy and walk humbly with your god
5525363 often when i talk to people about my work i find that they are curious about ways in which they can share in what we do let me share with you 5 6 ways you can plug into what were doing
5525364 we have had a good start and we might surprise a few people this year
5525365 we want the west ham fans cheering and making noises for the right reasons
5525366 in this day and age a lot of money is being spent in a lot of clubs and people want success and they want it quickly
5525367 however youve just got to step back sometimes and realise that these things do not happen overnight its a work in progress
5525368 people must understand that we have rich owners who have come in and want to raise the bar and the level of west ham
5525369 everyones bought into it and if you dont quite measure up youre obviously under pressure
5525370 officially im on my last year of my contract ive had preliminary talks about extension and theres been interest from elsewhere
5525371 a few people have rung me up in the last couple of days but i have never spoken to anybody about it
5525372 our match earlier this year in riyadh demonstrated the passion our saudi fans have for manchester united
5525373 we believe this groundbreaking partnership will bring the action of manchester united direct to our many fans in saudi arabia
5525374 we both like to play for our country it is a great honour for us so now we have a friendly match with belarus and we go away very happy
5525375 we come back on thursday night which is near the bolton match but we will be prepared to play
5525376 fabricio enjoyed the match it was a great start for him and the rest of the team
5525377 it was a fantastic result even though we didnt win we picked up a result that many teams would like at old trafford
5525378 we tried our best to win the game and were disappointed not to but we will take a point
5525379 we worked very hard during the rest of the game and we picked up a big result
5525380 i was happy to get my first goal of the season in my first game it was important for me but more so for the team
5525381 el pa s las v ctimas y sus familias no merecen que la inseguridad sea un motivo de con icto entre partidos
5525382 so many people try to fluff things up or disguise them or make them a little too clever but sometimes its the simplest thing that reaches people and it matters how you sing it it shouldnt be overblown and polished as opposed to a simple idea simply sung that is sung with conviction
5525383 mainly because it blocks other contending teams from acquiring him and maddux is a much needed improvement over eric stults and jason johnson we all no that
5525384 all things considered im not sure this is a huge improvement for the dodgers this isnt the greg maddux of the 90s if you look at madduxs home road splits hes obviously benefited from spacious petco park its likely madduxs last season so no draft picks in compensation so if the pads got a good prospect like mcdonald then its a better move for the pads than the dodgers
5525385 right now in maddux career he is probably not or maybe
5525386 somewhat surprising to us that ea agreed to change its offer from hostile to friendly
5525387 senator obama has also said many times that he is against special interests but like most politicians who say that he means that he is against other politicians special interests his own special interests are never called special interests neither are the environmental extremists who support the democrats called special interests but the green zealots who have for decades blocked the country from using oil within our own borders more oil than in saudi arabia by the way are also among the special interests with a big voicein the democratic party they are also a major factor in shutting down the democratic voting process in this case in the house of representatives where speaker nancy pelosi refuses to allow a vote on drilling for oil in places where the green zealots dont want drilling the congressional democrats could of course vote to continue forbidding drilling in those places but voters paying 4 a gallon for gas are not likely to agree with the green zealots and recent polls show that they do not rather than lose votes in the november elections by voting with the green zealots or lose the money that the green zealots contribute to the democratic party coffers nancy pelosi simply shut down the house of representatives so that there could be no votes and turned off the lights so that c span could not broadcast republicans speeches protesting what happened after all what is democracy compared to support from the green zealots
5525388 and the rangers stream out of their cabins they are the hunters we are the rabbits and maybe we dont wanna be found maybe we dont want you tracking us down
5525389 hmmmmm dress like a lady get treated like a lady dress like a hootchie mama get treated like one

5525394 cme wants this so badly because the futures market is one of the few monopolies left in the world
5525395 and its a monopoly because they have their own clearing operation
5525396 i think a lot of people are going to try to get an irs ruling that it is long term capital gains
5525397 they have yet to do a global deal or an acquisition in a different asset class
5525398 t his was precisely the point at which the problem collided with individual conscience this was every individuals experience no matter what route he might have followed to join the movement naziism he was fully informed in advanced concerning its attitude toward the jewish question but in almost no case did this question impinge on the realms of his own problems only gradually but steadily did the jewish question seep into the individuals own field of activity and each man was at a given moment faced with this decision how far did the measures periodically ordered almost always recognised for what they were but not as steps in a culminating process affect the carrying out of what he regarded as his own task and duties i must assume this that the decision was honestly faced but even that meant nothing more than the insinuation into each mans own sphere of the foulest sort of corruption of which the conscience can conceive the corruption that compels the individual to choose the lesser of two evils
5525399 can make it difficult to walk up and down stairs or run hop jump or kick a ball
5525400 he clearly suffers from a mild form but the fact he shows no sign of it at all is a great tribute to his acting skills and makes him a role model for other people with this condition

5525404 an entire generation of developing world youth would be removed from the cockpit of religious fundamentalism presuming they dont make the hideous mistake of moving to the american bible belt and would be exposed to the irresistible distractions of sex drugs and rocknroll they would be won over forever to the light side of the force the enlightenment liberalism atheism sexual permissiveness punk rock disco dancing ice cream real ale books puppy dogs and all that good stuff

5525417 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
5525418 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment

5525430 i wasnt at ibrox or parkhead last week so thats how far those rumours went
5525431 its hard to tell if he will be at birmingham when the transfer window closes but at the minute im there unless im told otherwise
5525432 to be perfectly honest i wouldnt entertain a move to glasgow
5525433 im happy to be playing outside scotland at the minute especially with the kind of press thats been going about for rangers and celtic im quite happy to be away from it
5525434 i read the papers and i watch the television and there has been some bad press for rangers recently
5525435 im afraid thats what you get at the two biggest teams there is always stories to be written whether they are good or bad
5525436 my place is not going to be given to me i still need to work hard for it
5525437 i watched the last two games and we played well at times so im looking forward to it and i will be doing my best to get the lads to a major finals

5525444 physical protests will not be tolerated by the authorities no matter what you feel about whaling
5525445 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5525446 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5525447 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5525448 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5525449 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern

5525455 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5525456 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5525458 tension control has become a critical requirement in label converting and package printing with the increased demand for film and unsupported substrates
5525459 every stage including unwinding web transport slitting and rewinding demands consistent and predictable performance to improve product quality and ultimately reduce costs

5525468 just like our fathers did when they set up the original businesses
5525469 ait was set up with one guiding philosophy every customer is different and their requirements for digital printing need the same flexibility as offered in conventional printing machines for too long we have watched customers either compromise on digital machinery only to find they are not getting a good return on their investment or not go the digital route when they really needed to because there wasnt a machine suited to their requirements ait was established to provide profitable digital print solutions without compromise
5525470 we have held off announcing our intent until now as we were not prepared to go to market without a mature technology the products we offer are industrially ready and answer the technical challenges presented by our clients

5525497 i think he understands the fact that he needs to be out there for 16 games this year
5525498 maybe we learned to live to fight another day and take 2 less yards running up the field theyre trying to rip the quarterbacks head off if they can knock the quarterback out of the game they feel good about their chances

5525567 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps those are the lessons learned

5525584 from very early on dr nelson has sided with the spirits industry in opposing this measure
5525585 but from the early evidence that we have from the tax office this measure is being successful
5525586 dr nelson needs to explain what impact his opposition to this measure will have on the health of young people and on the sorts of outcomes that we are trying to achieve for the community in making sure that young people have a healthier approach in the way they consume alcohol
5525587 that particular poll in no small way reflects the enormous amount of respect and regard in this country for the job that mr costello did as treasurer

5525589 i can assure you i am very determined and i will lead us to the next election
5525590 it will take a while before they voters reach the point of deciding when they have had enough defects disappointments and breakdowns before they decide that maybe in hindsight that they didnt do the right thing

5525604 any supervisor will know sometimes there are problems in relationships and were working very hard to fix those relationships
5525605 worksafe is helping us yes we should implement some of the recommendations that were made in the report and many of the recommendations made in the report are already in place
5525606 these are mostly men in their mid to late 50s or early 60s some of them have physical problems health problems that have nothing to do with stress or they may have been brought on by the stress of being a senior officer in emergency services for over 30 years
5525607 at this age and at this stage of our career a lot of us suffer health problems
5525608 its very hard to say whether they are on leave for stress or other health issues
5525609 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
5525610 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
5525611 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
5525612 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
5525613 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
5525614 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
5525615 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
5525616 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
5525617 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
5525618 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
5525619 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
5525620 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
5525621 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
5525622 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one

5525625 estamos hablando que desde enero a la fecha se han perdido todos esos empleos y eso obedece al fen meno econ mico por la recesi n que se esta viviendo en los estados unidos sobre todo en el rea electr nica y de autom viles
5525626 las autoridades lejos de atender la problem tica se encierran en ocultarla y el gobierno federal esta en las mismas condiciones y es el mayor culpable por la perdida de los empleos ya que no ha mostrado voluntad para seguir estimulando a los inversionistas
5525627 solo hay una maquiladora que ha cerrado en definitiva la rey mex donde se perdieron 600 empleos que han sido absorbidos por otras empresas que se han asentado en esta ciudad
5525628 pues la gente acostumbra cumplir con esta obligaci n la ltima semana antes de que concluya el plazo

5525630 es obvio que no hay manera en que el crimen organizado opere si no hay un alto grado de corrupci n en la pol tica en los negocios en la polic a me parece que todo eso lo tenemos que recomponer y hacia eso nos debemos de enfocar a la parte econ mica como el lavado de dinero
5525631 todo lo tenemos que enfocar hacia detener a la gente que est involucrada que reciban el castigo que la piensen m s de una vez atacar la impunidad atacar como lo he dicho una y otra vez el cinismo social
5525632 en lugar de que tengamos poquita presencia todos en todos lados si no nos vamos a coordinar por lo menos concentr monos por ejemplo unos del rea urbana y otros del rea rural por decir algo

5525636 tengo la seguridad de que 2009 ser un a o mucho mejor
5525637 no podemos sentirnos conformes con esa situaci n pero aclar que en la stps no se fijan topes salariales y son las partes involucradas las que llegan a acuerdo

5525668 this made the surgery complicated and difficult we had to identify a section of the arch in front of the wind and food pipes that we could sever and seal off at the same time we had to ensure it would not result in loss of blood circulation to any part of the body

5525682 i hope i can avoid surgery but the way it is right now its pretty bad pretty sore and i cant play
5525683 if its surgery then im out eight weeks and im done for the season but until the doctor tells me im going to hope for the best
5525684 there are a lot of things i want to accomplish you prepare to play a full season and when its cut short thats disappointing
5525685 we still have overstretched emergency department with many of those people in the waiting rooms who really should be seen by a gp
5525686 were going to provide the facilities for them to do that
5525687 its not to compete with the existing clinic or practices
5525688 one of the differences this is a walk in clinic whereas the calms clinic you need to make an appointment
5525689 its going to be a government run project we will cover the cost of these three clinics
5525690 it is expensive to run these things doctors are shying away from running these after hours clinics
5525691 thats why we believe that the government needs to step in
5525692 canberras a very attractive place to come and settle more attractive i would say than most parts of the country
5525693 we need to have good evidence that theyre not going to affect the local gps in that area cause theres not point setting up something that then forces another practice to close
5525694 so those are issues that really need to be sorted out very carefully
5525695 i think there are some major problems they needs to consult with the local gp workforce which have a lot of investment in this
5525696 this is private health industry and this is the liberals coming in and saying they are going to spend 30 million on private health areas
5525697 thats the issue with giving cash incentives it has to be equitable it has to be fair and it cant disadvantage the current gp population

5525766 hes getting contact the green jersey is supposed to keep you from ever having to strike anybody or have anybody strike you
5525767 but when the balls in your hands you tend to get shots hes getting plenty right now
5525768 you hate for anybody to miss time right now but its not like hes missed a lot of time at this point
5525769 this only happened recently hes just missed a few days and hopefully well have him back by mid week
5525770 considering today was the first day of school and there were a lot of things going on today it was pretty good
5525771 it wasnt great and if it wasnt for the fact that it was monday and we were coming off a day off and it wasnt the first of school i would have said it was not very good
5525772 we spent just a little bit of time working on our opponent just to get a little taste of that
5525773 the first day of that is usually a mess just trying to get that first thing organized but we looked halfway decent but tuesday weve got to get a lot better if we want to get where want to go
5525774 im glad it was a little warmer because we need it we need to feel it and we need to work in it because im certain it will be extremely hot on the 30th
5525775 we just havent had much of that its been like a big umbrella lately so we need the heat

5525784 google is known for innovation not only in the way they run their company but also in their applications and people seem to like some of the other services they have better than what yahoo and the others have
5525785 from a business perspective probably the most important metric you can have is whether you are satisfying your customers
5525786 because satisfied customers are going to be more loyal and recommend the service to other people
5525787 most of the services that google offers today they offered a year ago
5525788 because of the word of mouth factor there is a delay that happens between an innovation being launched and the average person understanding it

5525797 what concerned me was this was a veteran law enforcement officer telling me this
5525798 he told me the same thing he said be careful davis surrounds himself with police officers and is well insulated
5525799 the pressure they were putting on me is hard to describe
5525800 ive never had that happen you never want to stop someone when theyre in the middle of a confession because they might change their mind
5525801 tolbert wanted to know what smothers was telling me he seemed like he was afraid of what smothers was going to say to me
5525802 it didnt make any sense all the guys on the task force had worked so hard on this case and the supervisors were interfering
5525803 the prosecutors office told tolbert you dont have enough evidence to arrest cobb we all wanted to wait but tolbert told us to arrest cobb we were all wondering why we were bummed out
5525804 totally embarrassed they kept dancing around the kwame stuff like they didnt want to talk about it
5525805 but todd never got the chance to prove whether it was true or not
5525806 its like the line from shakespeare methinks they doth protest too much
5525807 from a cops perspective if someone tries to keep you from looking at something that means there may be something theyre trying to hide

5525903 we are asking our seniors to understand they are about to enter the job market or about to enter college so they can enter the job market
5525904 these are things wed like for them to understand to dress with respect in our community and with respect for our society is much different than what theyd like to wear everyday

5525906 there is a great deal of movement toward downtown redevelopment throughout texas as the baby boomers begin retiring

5525911 tenemos que negar los objetivos estrat gicos de rusia que evidentemente son socavar la democracia de georgia emplear su capacidad militar para da ar y en algunos casos destruir la infraestructura georgiana e intentar debilitar al estado georgiano
5525912 no vamos a permitir que rusia marque una nueva l nea en esos estados que a n no est n integrados en las estructuras transatl nticas
5525913 de manera clara que no estamos dispuestos a aceptar una nueva l nea

5525917 i hope i can avoid surgery but the way it is right now its pretty bad pretty sore and i cant play
5525918 if its surgery then im out eight weeks and im done for the season but until the doctor tells me im going to hope for the best
5525919 there are a lot of things i want to accomplish you prepare to play a full season and when its cut short thats disappointing
5525920 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obama s varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5525921 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5525922 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5525923 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5525924 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5525925 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home

5525927 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people

5525929 this portfolio is a must see for any potential buyer seeking to bolster their existing exposure to or to gain immediate critical mass to the los angeles market where economic conditions remain strong
5525930 its very rare for a portfolio of this size and caliber to be offered for sale plus it carries the added appeal of being composed of assets located in and among the most dynamic and appealing markets in the country if a prospective bidder already has a los angeles portfolio of loans this pool gives them the opportunity to instantly increase outstandings and market share with quality assets with economies of scale that derive from managing a larger portfolio of assets in a single metropolitan area
5525931 the practice is really nothing new at all just in a different format for a different generation

5525935 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5525936 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5525937 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5525938 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this

5525986 los empresarios realizaron un trabajo de prueba hace un mes y produjeron 800 000 kilos de yerba de buena calidad superada exitosamente la etapa de prueba ahora frenaron la producci n y se abocaron a la construcci n de la planta
5525987 en estimaciones que estamos realizando desde la comuna teniendo en cuenta lo que est n construyendo la empresa ya invirti cerca de 1 5 millones de d lares y la inversi n final rondar a los cuatro millones
5525988 la empresa quiere avanzar con la venta a egipto que es un mercado que est demandando el producto por esto est n muy interesados en tener su planta propia y as llegar a los 60 millones de kilos evidentemente les resulta un negocio interesante
5525989 ellos quieren que la yerba sea de buena calidad por lo que posiblemente trabajen con un determinado grupo de productores para que haya un control trazado desde la elaboraci n de hoja verde
5525990 la empresa no respet los 52 centavos fijados para la hoja verde y solo pag 35 por eso les aclaramos que si quieren contar con nuestro apoyo tienen que respetar las normativas
5525991 de a poco los productores fueron dejando de lado los yerbales o el t porque ya no eran tan rentables al principio surgi como una maniobra de escape a la nula rentabilidad de esos cultivos pero despu s comenzaron a darse cuenta que algunas producciones alternativas eran inclusive m s rentable que las tradicionales actividades que se realizan en la localidad
5525992 comenzaron probando y de a poco se fueron dando cuenta que era una actividad rentable y as fue aumentando la producci n el crecimiento ahora es bueno y este a o proyectamos llegar a las 400 toneladas de ra z y podemos anticipar que el a o que viene vamos a llegar al doble
5525993 est n avanzadas las negociaciones y esperamos que se concreten debido a que la actividad es muy rentable pero actualmente los que quieren vender su producci n tienen que ir a puerto rico o jard n am rica lo que les implica un gasto promedio de 800 pesos en flete

5526002 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5526003 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5526004 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5526005 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5526006 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5526007 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5526008 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5526009 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5526010 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5526011 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5526012 i need to know who to call to report a coyote in the middle of town

5526026 its a quarantine we can bring over insects that would attack a certain weed from asia or other places
5526027 we ship insects here they cant get out of this building unless theyre autoclaved which kills everything and we can do the testing to see what other plants they might eat what other insects they might bother
5526028 we would love to have that insect here within a couple of months it comes from kazhakstan we need to do the processing to get our permits to get it over here once we have it here it will take a few years of testing to make sure it doesnt attack any of the valued plants we have in the area
5526029 the whole biocontrol program takes maybe ten or more years to get through the process of getting approval and doing all the scientific research were going to cut that by two or three years by having the facility here

5526031 coal burning leaves toxic heavy metal legacy in the arctic
5526032 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and 70s the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s
5526033 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies
5526034 contamination of other sectors may be increasing because of the rapid coal driven growth of asian economies
5526035 giving and receiving are part of the same cycle and we each give and receive in our own ways but we can lose our balance when we try to be too controlling on either side of the cycle on the receiving end we may feel that we dont deserve the effort made if what we gave was easy for us to give but perhaps there is a different lesson there for us we may be receiving not only gratitude but a chance to see the world through the eyes of another we may be learning that just because we gave easily it doesnt diminish its value or perhaps the universe is giving us an example to hold close to our hearts to encourage us on some future day when our own generous act of giving is not met with a visible act of receiving when we can allow ourselves to receive as well as give we do our part to keep the channels of abundance open for ourselves and others sometimes we may find ourselves struggling to respond to others gifts in the same ways like responding to an expensive present with something equally expensive or feeling like we have to throw a dinner party for someone who has thrown one for us but when these are done out of a sense of obligation their energy changes from something that shares to something that drains if this sounds familiar we can decide next time to allow ourselves to receive with arms minds and hearts open and simply say thank you accepting a persons gift is a gift in itself sincere appreciation for their acknowledgement and their effort joins our energy with theirs in the cycle of giving and receiving and nurtures all involved if ever we find we are still having difficulty we can decide to allow ourselves to be conduits for gratitude and accept on behalf of a loving giving universe

5526099 its a big part of our labor force 900 jobs is a big deal to rapid city or western south dakota
5526100 agriculture timber industry tourism travel industry those kinds of things fluctuate seasonally and theyll be able to pick up some of those people im sure
5526101 900 jobs that say theyre averaging 30 000 thats a pretty good amount of salary to be spent in the rapid city area

5526105 17 of kids ages 2 to 19 are overweight so we really need to start at a young age and packing a good healthy lunch for them is a good idea
5526106 the best and easiest things are your fresh fruits and vegetables and those are packed with color and theyre packed with vitamins and minerals too

5526112 i am going with the satisfaction that whatever i have done was for the people and for the country i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5526113 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5526114 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5526115 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5526116 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order

5526123 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5526124 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5526125 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5526126 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5526127 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies

5526139 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies

5526156 looking back at the civil rights movement and the firehoses to have a man of color in a position to become the next president says two things to me first it means that we have made great strides as a country and that we have leveled the playing fields in our minds and hearts and even more importantly it means everything that now race means nothing

5526191 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
5526192 im a bloke who respects women i believe we should look after women im told men outnumber women here by five to one if thats the case then perhaps its an opportunity for some lonely women
5526193 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything i think its quite disgusting
5526194 most of us are seeing slightly slower growth but were still seeing growth

5526198 michael turner to us was the fit we want for offensive coordinator mike mularkeys system that being a system that depends on strong powerful running backs

5526200 hes got home run speed as well as hes got a very low center of gravity
5526201 all you are seeing is shoulder pads and knees theres not a lot of body surface to tackle him

5526213 since his first term bush has pressed forward with a radical view of the executive branch
5526214 policy analysts and legal scholars paint a picture of an executive intent on controlling every aspect of the federal bureaucracy in particular the agencies tasked with regulating industry and commerce
5526215 taken as a whole the presidents rejection of international law and his consolidation of administrative oversight are representative of a decades long effort by conservatives to implement a so called
5526216 but for such a creation to succeed the executive must assert its influence over all aspects of government from the top down through the ranks of the roughly 3 million civilian employees that today work in government jobs at more than 100 agencies and sub agencies
5526217 even his detractors say this is something bush has been especially adept at
5526218 some appointees are scrambling to push through last minute regulation changes

5526235 without immediate action hundreds of thousands of people will be displaced by climate change in the coming decades pacific islanders are already affected with their islands very vulnerable to sea level rises storm surge and loss of food security and water supplies
5526236 the pacific islands forum this week is an opportunity to define a more concrete programme of action to assist pacific islanders
5526237 therefore we call on the australian and new zealand governments to recognise the urgency of climate change and the particular threat it poses to the peoples of the pacific
5526238 the australian and new zealand governments must begin a real process of partnership with pacific island countries in finding ways to prepare for and assist with the resettlement of pacific island people who will be displaced by global warming
5526239 low lying island nations such as tuvalu and kiribati are already facing rising seas storms and king tides that are having a terrible impact we could see sea level rises of several metres this century for tuvalu which has an average height of less than two metres that is a disaster
5526240 the pacific island leadership forum is an opportunity to work with pacific island countries on a plan to assist with large scale displacement australia and new zealand cannot sit on its hands and wait for the disaster to come now is the time for action
5526241 taking action on climate change for the pacific is obviously something that the pacific island nations cant do themselves they havent been responsible for emissions that have caused this problem and they dont have the capacity to be able to defend themselves against climate change
5526242 there are three key things first to reduce emissions to meet kyoto protocol obligations and without having to buy offsets of international emissions second they need to carry the message that there should be binding targets at the international level through the united nations negotiations and be prepared to sign up themselves to reduce emissions by at least 13 per cent by the year 2020 and thirdly australia and new zealand really need to support pacific island countries with money and technology for defending themselves against climate change impacts which are already happening in the pacific

5526246 if there are two americans and one russian we win
5526247 we continue to be adequately capitalized and we are committed to raising additional capital were financially sound and have strong liquidity

5526249 the price of oil is skyrocketing and that means gas prices are up
5526250 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
5526251 the worsening economic outlook suggests that oil prices have further to fall but opec whose members are due to meet in early september may act to prevent them from falling too far
5526252 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
5526253 would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5526254 people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5526255 we have to invent a new language with regard to russia that is what the european union is trying to do
5526256 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
5526257 russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5526258 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5526259 would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5526260 people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5526261 we have to invent a new language with regard to russia that is what the european union is trying to do
5526262 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
5526263 russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5526264 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5526265 if this ceasefire clause on pre 7 august positions is not applied quickly and in its entirety i will convoke an extraordinary council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5526266 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5526267 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5526268 we will have to determine if the russian intervention against its georgian neighbour was a brutal and excessive response
5526269 in which case there will be inevitable consequences for its relations with the european union
5526270 i do not advise any knee jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement with the eu
5526271 our interest in this is as great as russia itself talks in the nato russian council are essential too because we need open lines of communication
5526272 we must stick to the partnership with russia even after these recent events which of course do not please us
5526273 then you know something very developmentally significant just happened youve gained a partner
5526274 bull markets are born on pessimism grow on skepticism mature on optimism and die on euphoria

5526278 as the world economy continues to become rapidly interconnected and globalised the cross border flow of funds is also increasing such phenomena while benefiting the world in the form of increased opportunities also offers opportunities for criminals at the same time posing an even bigger risk for international money laundering and the financing of terrorism activities
5526279 such illegal practices accentuate the need for national and international cooperation and specifically increasing the roles of law enforcement agencies such as the financial intelligence unit the financial supervisory commission and other relevant ministries or agencies in the cook islands

5526292 the benefits of physical activity have been extolled throughout western history but it was not until the second half of this century that scientific evidence supporting these beliefs began to accumulate by the 1970s enough information was available about the beneficial effects of vigorous exercise on cardiorespiratory fitness that the american college of sports medicine acsm the american heart association aha and other national organizations began issuing physical activity recommendations to the public these recommendations generally focused on cardiorespiratory endurance and specified sustained periods of vigorous physical activity involving large muscle groups and lasting at least 20 minutes on 3 or more days per week as understanding of the benefits of less vigorous activity grew recommendations followed suit during the past few years the acsm the cdc the aha the pcpfs and the nih have all recommended regular moderate intensity physical activity as an option for those who get little or no exercise the healthy people 2000 goals for the nations health have recognized the importance of physical activity and have included physical activity goals the 1995 dietary guidelines for americans the basis of the federal governments nutrition related programs included physical activity guidance to maintain and improve weight 30 minutes or more of moderate intensity physical activity on all or most days of the week

5526296 the fuel would be encapsulated in a mechanically strong high temperature system so that explosive high temperature dispersion of the reactor core would prove extremely unlikely

5526345 being able to bring continued advances to our high capacity reliable enterprise class storage solutions is critically important to our customers who are managing exploding volumes of increasingly valuable data
5526346 by working closely with other world class technology providers such as the tape engineers at fujifilm our new one terabyte drive is bringing the next generation to market today
5526347 fujifilm continues to supply reliable high capacity media for these mission critical data center back up solutions based on our nanocubic technology

5526349 brooke corporations operations focus on banking we recently revived the generations bank trade name and are actively pursuing growth in our bank agent network through our wholly owned thrift institution
5526350 brooke corporation also owns investments in aleritas capital corp bcp an insurance agency franchisor we expect brooke corporations 62 ownership interest in aleritas capital and brooke corporations 66 ownership interest in brooke capital to each be reduced to less than 50 in 2008 which will eliminate the accounting requirement to consolidate the revenues expenses assets and liabilities of aleritas capital and brooke capital with brooke corporation
5526351 as expected it was a challenging quarter for brooke capital corporation
5526352 our new era and operating initiatives previously announced have been implemented and managements actions have resulted in brooke capital becoming a leaner and more efficient organization we expect to return to profitability in the third quarter
5526353 losses were incurred in the second quarter primarily as the result of shrinking the number of brooke franchise locations by closing relocating or liquidating poorer performing locations difficult credit markets have had a significant adverse affect on the sale of new franchise locations by the company without revenues from the sale of new locations the company has been forced to reduce expenses significantly the resulting expense reductions include personnel layoffs facility closings and write offs of producer development investments
5526354 kyle garst and dane devlin did a good job of transitioning our company in the second quarter to the limited growth business model required to wait out the current credit markets to assist in returning brooke capital to profitability in the third quarter i have taken a more active role in the company although i remain chairman and kyle remains president of brooke capital i have assumed the responsibilities of chief executive officer so kyle can focus on the sale of troubled locations
5526355 while kyle and dane were going through a difficult downsizing at brooke capital during the second quarter i had focused my efforts on aleritas capital another company in which both brooke corporation and i have significant ownership interests now that aleritas capital has returned to profitability i have redirected much of my attention to brooke capital with expectations of returning it to profitability in the third quarter
5526356 the value of brooke capital corporation is its insurance distribution system which generates about 1 billion per year in premiums until credit markets improve brooke capital corporation is focused on improving the quality of its agency force and distribution channels
5526357 florida community associations can never be too prepared for the approach of a tropical storm or hurricane and the same holds true in the immediate aftermath of a storm history and experience have shown that association boards and managers can feel pressured by circumstance and eager contractors into making hasty decisions with unforeseen consequences
5526358 every community association in the path of a tropical storm or hurricane should be ready to put into action immediate measures once a storm passes to mitigate any further damage and quickly assess the extent of damages to their properties
5526359 communities that act quickly and decisively once a storm has passed can avoid many of the pitfalls associated with contracting for repairs and securing damage recovery from the insurers of their buildings or facilities
5526360 we are encouraged by the fact that gross revenues have increased by 40 compared to the previous quarter this is driven by higher revenues from our service reclamation operations both in north america and in egypt our operating costs excluding a one time item have increased by 28 compared to the previous quarter our margins are improving and we are working hard to focus our activities and to streamline and simplify our sales operating and support processes while looking for further growth

5526404 it is audacious for mccain to go before the vfw and claim credit for a bill he nearly destroyed considering the vfw was one of the bills strongest backers
5526405 people are leaving after their first enlistment because they are tired of being shot at and their families are tired of the frequent deployments for his leadership on the measure
5526406 john mccain served his time as a pow with great courage loyalty and tenacity
5526407 i furthermore believe that having been a pow is no special qualification for being president of the united states
5526408 i can verify that john has an infamous reputation for being a hot head
5526409 it is also disappointing to see him take on and support bushs war in iraq even stating we might be there for another 100 years
5526410 im disappointed to see john represent himself politically in ways that are not accurate he is not a moderate republican on some issues he is a maverick but his voting record is far to the right i fear for his nominations to our comments

5526412 this means that a single linux download amp upgrade will give you the newest drivers available for your machine whereas in windows you would have to surf to multiple sites and download all the upgrades individually its a very different process but its certainly not a bad one but many people complain because its not what theyre used to
5526413 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5526414 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time

5526417 i hope i can avoid surgery but the way it is right now its pretty bad pretty sore and i cant play
5526418 if its surgery then im out eight weeks and im done for the season but until the doctor tells me im going to hope for the best
5526419 there are a lot of things i want to accomplish you prepare to play a full season and when its cut short thats disappointing

5526423 for he loves our nation and has built us a synagogue
5526424 lord do not trouble yourself for i am not worthy that you should enter under my roof
5526425 therefore i did not even think myself worthy to come to you
5526426 for i also am a man placed under authority having soldiers under me and i say to one go and he goes and to another come and he comes and to my servant do this and he does it
5526427 i say to you i have not found such great faith not even in israel
5526428 send us to the swine that we may enter them
5526429 also we have come to believe and know that you are the christ the son of the living god
5526430 did i not choose you the twelve and one of you is a devil
5526431 i tell you get up take your mat and go home
5526432 all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth
5526433 as you have given him authority over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as you have given him
5526434 and this is eternal life that they may know you the only true god and jesus christ whom you have sent
5526435 as the father knows me even so i know the father and i lay down my life for the sheep
5526436 and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they will hear my voice and there will be one flock and one shepherd
5526437 therefore my father loves me because i lay down my life that i may take it again
5526438 no one takes it from me but i lay it down of myself i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again this command i have received from my father
5526439 he has a demon and is mad why do you listen to him
5526440 these are not the words of one who has a demon can a demon open the eyes of the blind
5526441 for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
5526442 i will honor respect those in authority over me as long as i agree with them
5526443 who committed no sin nor was deceit found in his mouth

5526447 i am not able to bear all these people alone because the burden is too heavy for me
5526448 if you treat me like this please kill me here and now if i have found favor in your sight and do not let me see my wretchedness
5526449 gather to me seventy men of the elders of israel whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them bring them to the tabernacle of meeting that they may stand there with you
5526450 then i will come down and talk with you there
5526451 then you shall say to the people consecrate yourselves for tomorrow and you shall eat meat for you have wept in the hearing of the lord saying
5526452 the people whom i am among are six hundred thousand men on foot yet you have said i will give them meat that they may eat for a whole month
5526453 shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them to provide enough for them or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them to provide enough for them
5526454 has the lords arm been shortened now you shall see whether what i say will happen to you or not
5526455 dont eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
5526456 a new commandment i give to you that you love one another as i have loved you that you also love one another
5526457 by this all will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another
5526458 the voice of a god and not of a man
5526459 men and brethren i have lived in all good conscience before god until this day
5526460 god will strike you you whitewashed wall for you sit to judge me according to the law and do you command me to be struck contrary to the law
5526461 i did not know brethren that he was the high priest for it is written you shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people
5526462 you shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people
5526463 that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth
5526464 surely this isnt gods will for me i dont have to submit to something as harsh as this
5526465 hottest thing to hit the streets of new york since building 7 is a problema thats problem in spanish
5526466 youre not letting us be science because of your materialistic philosophical definition of science that intentionally denies god exists
5526467 i am mystified that anyone can say the question of whether id is or is not science is the primary issue thats an academic philosophical dispute far removed from what most people care about including myself
5526468 well at least you admit its science so lets teach the controversy and let the public students decide for themselves
5526469 id has a lousy track record of failed explanations misrepresentation and outright deceit
5526470 the specific assertions made by id folks about irreducible complexity complex specified information the alleged holes in evolutionary science and so on are universally false thats why scientists reject id
5526471 well but id is not a scientific explanation it provides no mechanism
5526472 that in itself hasnt stopped them from claiming its nevertheless a valid theory in the nature of a self evident truth
5526473 and in the case of id or creationism and this was my inference these theories are neither true nor evident
5526474 if not i would think that a determined biologist could more or less force something like that to happen find a short lived sexually reproducing organism of some kind with very short generations start inducing mutations cull the fatal ones and keep trying to you come up with something
5526475 while its good to emphasize both points scientific vacuity and patently false and ridiculous claims
5526476 show me 50 million years of evolution by next thursday
5526477 are you claiming that gravitation at least before general relativity for instance would have been a religious assertion
5526478 god makes things fall in whatever way he wants them to fall
5526479 yes its self evident thats exactly how god wanted things to fall
5526480 self evident truths are not scientific theories they are religious assertions
5526481 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
5526482 that fact should be front and center in every evolution apologetic
5526483 in fact a self evident truth is very much intended to be a rational assertion often but not always used to justify a religious assertion
5526484 lions and tigers for example are considered separate species because they do not naturally interbreed in the wild they would kill each other before interbreeding however in captivity it is shown that they are biologically capable of interbreeding even though they have not done so naturally for what is probably millions of years
5526485 a self evident proposition is one that is known to be true by understanding its meaning without proof
5526486 that in itself hasnt stopped them from claiming its nevertheless a valid theory in the nature of a self evident truth
5526487 self evident truths are not scientific theories they are religious assertions and you cant argue against them scientifically
5526488 a self evident proposition is one that is known to be true by understanding its meaning without proof
5526489 dobzhansky and pavlovsky 1971 reported a speciation event that occurred in a laboratory culture of drosophila paulistorum sometime between 1958 and 1963 the culture was descended from a single inseminated female that was captured in the llanos of colombia in 1958 this strain produced fertile hybrids when crossed with conspecifics of different strains from orinocan from 1963 onward crosses with orinocan strains produced only sterile males initially no assortative mating or behavioral isolation was seen between the llanos strain and the orinocan strains later on dobzhansky produced assortative mating dobzhansky 1972
5526490 despite these fundamental differences most americans 64 say they are open to the idea of teaching creationism along with evolution in the public schools and a substantial minority 38 favors replacing evolution with creationism in public school curricula
5526491 you will find that conradg wont let facts get in the way of his single minded rampages
5526492 still i have to wonder what the poll results actually mean
5526493 the only reason creationism is not formally taught in us schools is because supreme court decisions over the last 40 years have prevented it government sanctioned knitting classes are not prohibited by the constitution
5526494 creationism intelligent design and other claims of supernatural intervention in the origin of life or of species are not science because they are not testable by the methods of science
5526495 the search for natural explanations for what is observed in the universe
5526496 a purely political endeavor staffed by public relations people and secretaries and people writing occasional articles and so forth
5526497 actually science never claimed that nuclear reactions were not divine radiance but you cant cut and paste that simple thought if you dont have enough thought to find it
5526498 which is why we dont go into the supporting details of nuclear physics in describing why the sun is fueled by certain nuclear reactions and not by divine radiance
5526499 and what do you mean that scientists arent claiming that the sun is fueled by nuclear reactions rather than by divine radiance of course they are
5526500 are there then no divine forces or none that radiate mr religious person there may well be but by definition such forces are divine in nature not physical or mental in nature
5526501 which is why we dont go into the supporting details of nuclear physics in describing why the sun is fueled by certain nuclear reactions and not by divine radiance
5526502 a religious theory about the origins of the universe is not a scientific theory a religious theory about the origins of species is not a scientific theory period
5526503 isnt it written somewhere that the earliest scientific theories were in fact born as religious hypotheses and that they were precisely about the origins of the universe and life in that universe and that a particular religious theory can lay a just claim to being scientific as well even though science has not yet laid claim to being a religion
5526504 the future of the web may be its past an abandonment of open standards and services and a return to the gated communities
5526505 abandon their ability to kill any apps at any time for any reason
5526506 create and run powerful business applications in the cloud will change the economics of the software industry forever
5526507 retaining the right just in case they need it to kill any app they dont like and to control the flow of data
5526508 through historical accident weve ended up with a global network that pretty much allows anybody to communicate with anyone else at any time
5526509 now i see a movement away from that framework even though it doesnt feel like a movement away
5526510 for example an iphone can only be changed by steve jobs or soon with the software development kit by programmers that he personally approves that go through his iphone apps store or whimsical applications that run on the facebook platform or the new google apps these are controllable by their vendors in ways that bill gates never dreamed of controlling windows applications
5526511 in this new environment the developers are at the mercy of the platform owners and while its not the end of the world i think this is a riskier environment to run a business
5526512 while the shift to the cloud is ongoing and will continue to move forward the relational logistics between businesses and platform owners still need to be worked through
5526513 with a guy like bruce that has some receiver background a lot of receiver background actually he knows the defense so well because he was a safety the past few years
5526514 he can step out on that field second or third day of practice and be fine with the routes and how to run them
5526515 hes probably one of our better route runners right now
5526516 im practicing with the ones and twos but i dont really know where i am
5526517 a bankrupts entire interest in superannuation is protected from being divisible among creditors
5526518 a smooth pattern of contributions will give the greatest asset protection if things start to go wrong with your business
5526519 there should be substantial reasons for making extra large super contributions
5526520 the contributions for example could be made as part of a well thought out retirement plan to achieve retirement goals
5526521 a financial planner could formulate a retirement plan articulating a capital target this evidence would counter the presumption that large contributions were made to defeat creditors
5526522 that loud crack heard throughout the evangelical world when national research showed that more than half of american evangelicals believe people of other religions can go to heaven wasnt thunder from an angry god

5526527 the level of funding that was put into place by coag the council of australian governments is vastly inferior to what was needed
5526528 so one of the things that were calling for is an increased level of funding to go into the initiative going forward but also to look at the systemic policy issues that need to be addressed if we are going to go forward with this problem
5526529 it is not putting too fine a point on it to say young peoples lives are on the line in this issue

5526537 this is more than a simple storm story and joins a tradition of evocative place biographies the author develops his memoir beyond the events of august 2005 into an examination of what makes a community significant
5526538 joy and sorrow are offered up in equal measure this book is his heartfelt tribute
5526539 a gifted writer never overwrought or dramatic as in many katrina memoirs he writes with maturity insight and in gorgeous color both of the devastation and of a city regaining its charm in ragged spurts
5526540 mcnultys account is compelling because he both lived through and reported on the limbo like transition from triage to healing his fight to bring life back to his empty block and city is what gives the book a moving sense of struggle and determination

5526581 this group has been largely undermined intimidated harassed to the point where over 12 months ago a report was undertaken to find out why there was a high level of stress and sick leave and it came back with some damning findings and strong recommendations
5526582 a couple of months ago the union issued a provisional improvement notice and worksafe has since issued an improvement notice that reflects the issues raised by the union
5526583 they need to fix up the situation or face some pretty tough fines
5526584 theyve been subjected to issues of poor communication poor management poor relationships with superiors they have been sidelined and their experience hasnt been drawn upon
5526585 for example theyve had no input into decision making despite possessing a great body of knowledge
5526586 theyre not just firefighters theyve progressed through their careers and they are at the point where they possess various skills these are the people that work out various contingencies and disasters so theyre operating at a very high level
5526587 these are allegations that are being made they havent been proven
5526588 were talking about 10 people on a senior level and positions at that level are very stressful
5526589 any supervisor will know sometimes there are problems in relationships and were working very hard to fix those relationships
5526590 worksafe is helping us yes we should implement some of the recommendations that were made in the report and many of the recommendations made in the report are already in place
5526591 these are mostly men in their mid to late 50s or early 60s some of them have physical problems health problems that have nothing to do with stress or they may have been brought on by the stress of being a senior officer in emergency services for over 30 years
5526592 at this age and at this stage of our career a lot of us suffer health problems
5526593 its very hard to say whether they are on leave for stress or other health issues
5526594 quite clearly there is not a confidence out there in the community that the environmental protection and planning for the greater darwin area is occurring and that i think is the reality of the situation no matter what governments of any colour is saying and we need that information
5526595 it became more and more part of almost the corporate badging of government rather than being seen as an independent body

5526602 brownlee and clarke flew by me as they start their final lap on the bike both are looking comfortable in the middle of the main pack nobody seems concerned about the three man breakaway their lead was about 30 seconds but none of the big boys are involved so it looks like it will come down to a shoot out on the run tim don has just gone past me and he is labouring about four and a half minutes down and on his own he has a long and lonely ride ahead of him
5526603 a nightmare for tim don he is not in the leading group of 40 and he has dropped off the chasing pack and is almost two minutes behind he is now riding on his own and his olympic dream seems over the 20 year old alistair brownlee is looking good and is right at the front after a fantastic swim while will clarke is in the second group about a minute back

5526607 look out for alistair brownlee in the tri last time i saw him he was kicking my a se at the ilkley triathlon considering he was still wearing armbands and stabilisers it was a fearsome performance future champ
5526608 an open question for everyone even you pranav do you think that due to the success weve had with the bikes and in water sports that more money from the lottery fund should go towards these sports as we are more likely to pick up medals in them than track and field
5526609 lets hope we have a tremendous tuesday and make it our best medal haul ever all of team gb should be proud of what weve achieved at these games so far
5526610 there is still an hour to go before the start of the triathlon which is being held at a fantastic location team gb has three competitors and a decent shout at a medal but the heat is already a problem i just spotted gb hope will clarke checking the pressure on his bike tyres his family are all over here to support him and gave out a big cheer as he pedalled slowly past

5526642 the large unrelenting unrepentant poster child for the coal industry
5526643 theres not enough natural gas theres not enough renewables such as wind and solar energy to go around so im not concerned that coal is going to disappear for us not to use that resource we are just shooting ourselves in the foot
5526644 the cost of electricity has only just begun to rise therefore we ought to be prudent in how we go about regulation
5526645 coal has to be a big centerpiece of our energy strategy because its our major reserve base
5526646 theres a perception out there that coal is dirty and we have to change that
5526647 i was thinking i need to get a big part of the business thats growing 8 a year vs relying on the u s market growing 1 to 2

5526677 there are many dangers in horse racing for both horse and jockey a horse can stumble and fall or fall when jumping an obstacle exposing both jockey and horse to the danger of being trampled and injured
5526678 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used when it wishes to deliver a message that is its military power
5526679 i think the french will undoubtedly be seeking from the russians an explanation for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5526680 were reinforcing the point that they are safely within the transatlantic structures
5526681 thats just to remind people that russia is a far cry in terms of its geostrategic center from where the soviet union was
5526682 i think everybody recognizes that this is not the first time that weve seen this problem
5526683 weve had russian strategic aviation challenging even along borders with the united states which i might note is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5526684 the hope had been that russia was going to build its foundation and relationships with europe and the united states on the basis of russian economic political cultural and other kinds of assets
5526685 and reminding people that bears can fly near norway or near alaska and that you can use military force against a small neighbor is not a particularly appealing message or image
5526686 i now know your prowess lady and i am afraid

5526692 kalau begitu aku akan mengajakmu ke rumahku saja siapa tahu kamu akan merasa lebih tenang di rumahku daripada kamu terus terusan di sini
5526693 banyak sekali kekurangan yang aku miliki tapi aku tidak sedikitpun memiliki kelebihan begitu tidak adilnya tuhan padaku siang malam aku berdoa tapi itu juga tidak menunjukkan perubahan yang berarti apa yang telah aku lakukan sehingga tuhan begitu benci padaku
5526694 tuhan itu adil pada kita hanya saja setiap orang memandangnya dengan cara dan dari segi yang berbeda sebenarnya aku yakin kalau kamu pasti memiliki kelebihan yang sampai sekarang masih terpendam kelebihan yang diberikan tuhan padamu itu pasti akan berguna di masa mendatang aku yakin itu
5526695 akhirnya setelah lama kita tak berjumpa sekarang kita bisa bertemu lagi selama perjalanan hidupku bersama kalian hanya satu yang paling membekas di lubuk hatiku waktu itu adalah hari terakhir aku ada di kota ini selepas pulang sekolah sebenarnya aku hendak bunuh diri tapi untungnya ada teman yang masih berbaik hati mengajakku ke rumahnya aku tahu pengorbanan apa yang direlakannya untuk menolongku itu sangat besar niatku untuk bunuh diri menjadi terkurunkan bagaimana tidak dengan kehidupanku waktu itu yang kacau balau aku sudah tidak sanggup lagi hidup di dunia ini perang dingin di antara kedua orang tuaku yang hendak bercerai ditambah lagi banyak di antara kalian yang menjauhiku dengan alasan keadaan fisikku yang tidak mendukung serta kemampuan akademisku yang berbeda dengan kebanyakan di antara kalian aku sungguh berterima kasih kepadanya aku tidak akan berdiri tegap di sini dengan kesuksesanku yang telah kuraih kalau saat itu dia tidak menolongku sampai sekarang aku masih berhutang budi padanya

5526714 my husband he died and i laughed till i cried
5526715 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5526716 a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated
5526717 level of objectivity has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5526718 we are concerned that your news division is following msnbcs lead in abandoning nonpartisan coverage of the presidential race

5526728 apa yang kita lakukan ini adalah untuk memperkenalkan undang undang bagi tujuan itu saya tidak tahu kenapa ada pihak yang berkata ada motif tertentu untuk kita mewujudkan akta ini

5526834 to intensely desire that her husband have sex with their maid
5526835 value of the testimony of a witness is whether such is in conformity with the knowledge and consistent with the experience of mankind
5526836 the backdrop presented the offenders with a tempting opportunity to satisfy their twisted desires upon a conveniently placed victim
5526837 the subsequent rapes occurred in exactly the same manner as in previous incidents is clearly inadequate and grossly insufficient to establish to a degree of moral certainty the guilt
5526838 each and every rape charge is a separate and distinct crime hence each of the other rapes should be proven beyond reasonable doubt
5526839 sesungguhnya allah tidak memberikan suatu kenikmatan atas seseorang hamba kecuali didalam kenikmatan itu disertakan nya argumentasi yang jelas sehingga barangsiapa yang memperoleh anugerah allah lalu dirinya menjadi kuat maka argumentasi logis dari nikmat kekuatan yang diterimanya tersebut harus digunakan untuk membantu yang lebih lemah barangsiapa yang dianugerahi oleh allah menjadi kaya maka hartanya harus menjadi bukti atas anugerah tersebut yakni dengan melaksanakan kewajiban kewajiban kepada kaum fakir miskin
5526840 sesungguhnya shalatku ibadatku hidupku dan matiku hanyalah untuk allah tuhan semesta alam
5526841 kesabaran itu ada dua macam sabar atas sesuatu yang tidak kau ingini dan sabar menahan diri dari sesuatu yang kau ingini apabila sesuatu yang kau senangi tidak terjadi senangilah apa yang terjadi para ahli agama yang paling bijak adalah mereka yang tidak membuat orang berputus asa akan rahmat allah atau kehilangan harapan akan santunan dan kasih sayang nya tetapi juga tidak membuat orang terus menerus merasa aman dari pembalasan nya
5526842 i was never political until i was 18 but in 2004 i was in ukraine on a tourist trip with my friends and i saw happy people who were protesting
5526843 they were all together and i thought that they were capable of changing something in their country

5526845 we are meant to prepare our young people to become young professional politicians
5526846 nashi is organized by people whose only religion is success and mimicry
5526847 there has to be a kind of moral foundation in a real youth movement

5526855 maybe i could combine both and be the first naked country star like johnny cash only blond and with nice dd boobies
5526856 i have a tremendous amount of respect for how they handled that
5526857 i can tell you after talking to marian it made him feel really good the way they shared everything with him about the team and the future i thought it was a smart move on their behalf it was a very beneficial thing they did
5526858 i dont know anything about that ive had no conversations with any team in russia about gaborik
5526859 marian has a year left on his contract with the wild and hes working hard and feeling good he says hes coming to camp in the best shape hes ever been in
5526860 my answer to that is marians enjoyed a great career there in minny hes made no decisions in that regard yet he has a year left on his contract and he plans to honor that contract well see how things fall together from there
5526861 we need the help of isps they have the technical ability to manage the flow over their pipes

5526863 bangsat kecil hari ini aku mengubur engkau di dalam tapi untungnya masih bagus kau mampus dengan ditemani seorang wanita biarpun kau bertenaga besar aku mau lihat apa kau mampu menyingkirkan batu ini kalau satu tak cukup aku akan menambah dengan satu lagi
5526864 andaikata ia sekarang berubah pikiran dan ingin menolong kami berdua ia sudah tak bisa berbuat begitu
5526865 sudahlah buat apa aku meladeni dia paling baik aku cari jalan lain
5526866 bila barusan letusan api menyambar ke tumpukan bahan peledak itu hwee shio jahat yang berada di luar akan turut binasa bersama sama kita
5526867 dengan melihat romanku jelek ia merasa senang tanpa menyamar aku tentu sudah mati
5526868 tadi waktu ia sudah tidak bisa bergerak kau mencekal pedang tapi kau tidak mencelakai dia mulai dari sekarang ia pasti tak akan curiga lagi
5526869 dengan membawa kau kemari siocia tentu akan lebih curiga lagi
5526870 tapi sudahlah perduli apa dia curiga atau tidak masih belum tentu apa kita bisa keluar dari tempat ini
5526871 kudengar siocia memanggil boe kie koko kepadamu kalau tak salah namamu boe kie benarkah begitu
5526872 rantai ini memang sangat aneh tak dapat diputuskan walaupun dengan menggunakan senjata mustika
5526873 kalau kita bisa keluar aku akan minta anak kunci itu
5526874 mungkin kita tak bisa menghancurkan batu ini dengan satu ledakan
5526875 kau belum pernah mengenal aku tapi tapi mengapa kau begitu baik terhadapku
5526876 aku adalah seorang budak yang kedudukannya sangat rendah kau kau seorang yang mulia mengapa kau melindungi aku dengan menghadang di depanku
5526877 kau seorang wanita dan adalah sepantasnya saja jika aku berusaha untuk melindungi keselamatanmu
5526878 untuk membuat lubang yang cukup besar guna merangkak keluar batu ini mungkin harus diledakkan tujuh atau delapan kali tapi sisa bahan peledak hanya cukup untuk kira kira dua kali ledakan
5526879 mungkin kita berada di bagian paling ujung dari jalan rahasia ini
5526880 beng kauw seng hwee sim hoat kian koon tay lo ie
5526881 kalau tak bisa keluar paling lama tujuh delapan hari aku dan siauw ciauw akan mati kelaparan ilmu yang bagaimana tinggipun tiada gunanya

5526883 mereka berdua adalah murid murid beng kauw dan mereka tak berani masuk ke sini untuk mengambilnya seperti kongcoe ketahui hanya seorang kauwcoe yang boleh masuk ke jalan rahasia ini
5526884 apakah tak baik bila kita membaca surat itu mungkin sekali yo kauwcoe meninggalkan pesan
5526885 andaikata ada sesuatu yang diinginkan yo kauwcoe dan belum terpenuhi alangkah baiknya jika diketahui kita supaya kita bisa menyampaikan langsung kepada looya dan siocia
5526886 hoe jin bacalah ini semenjak menikah denganku siang malam hoe jin berduka aku adalah seorang yang tak mempunyai budi sehingga aku tak bisa menyenangkan hatimu dan untuk kekurangan itu aku merasa menyesal tak habisnya kini kita akan berpisah untuk selama lamanya kuharap hoe jin sudi memaafkanku cioe kauwcoe dari turunan ketiga puluh dua telah memerintahkan supaya setelah selesai dalam latihan kian koen tay lo ie sin kang aku segera pergi ke congto dari kay pang markas besar partai pengemis untuk mengambil kembali barang barang peninggalan cioe kauwcoe dari turunan ketiga puluh satu aku baru saja menyelesaikan latihan sin kang tingkat kelima apa daya aku tahu urusan seng soe tee darah dan hawa bergolak golak dan aku tak dapat menguasai diriku lagi tenagaku akan buyar dan aku menghadapi kematian inilah takdir tiada manusia dapat melawan takdir
5526887 kalau begitu sebelum menulis surat yo kauwcoe telah tahu adanya pertemuan antara seng koen dan istrinya di jalan rahasia ini
5526888 jika ia tetap mencintai seng koen seharusnya ia tak boleh menikah dengan yo kauwcoe setelah menikah dengan yo kauwcoe ia tak boleh membuat pertemuan rahasia lagi dengan seng koen
5526889 siapapun jua yang bisa mengambil barang peninggalan cioe kauwcoe dan seng hwee leng dialah yang akan menjadi kauwcoee turunan ketiga puluh empat dari agama kita siapa yang membantah boleh segera dibinasakan akupun memerintahkan supaya untuk sementara waktu cia soen bertindak sebagai hoe kauwcoe wakil pemimpin agama untuk mengurus berbagai urusan dari agama kita

5526893 yo kauwcoe ternyata memang ingin mengurung seng koen dalam jalan rahasia ini dan rela mati bersama sama

5526896 di saat ini hanya yo siauw sianseng yang pernah berlatih ilmu itu tapi kepandaiannya masih cetek sehingga andaikata ia berada di sini belum tentu ia bisa berhasil di samping itu kitapun tak tahu di mana tempat kedudukan boe ong wie tidak tertulis di atas peta di mana kita harus mencarinya
5526897 meskipun tak mengenal kian koen tay lo ie sin kang aku sudah memiliki kioe yang sin kang mungkin dapat digunakan
5526898 siauw ciauw akulah yang bersalah aku mengajak kau kemari sehingga kau tidak bisa keluar lagi

5526906 apakah tidak baik jika kau melatih sin kang dari kian koen tay lo ie kau sangat cerdas dan mungkin sekali segera berhasil
5526907 para kauwcoe dari beng kauw telah berlatih seumur hidup tapi hanya beberapa orang saja yang bisa dikatakan berhasil
5526908 sebagai kauwcoe mereka pasti bukan orang sembarangan mereka semua mempunyai kecerdasan dan kepandaian yang sangat tinggi bagaimana caranya aku bisa mengharap bahwa dalam waktu singkat aku bisa berhasil dalam suatu latihan yang sukar yang tidak dapat dilakukan oleh para mendiang kauwcoe itu
5526909 hari ini ada kesenangan nikmatilah kesenangan itu hari ini bisa berlatih berlatihlah hari ini
5526910 inilah sin kang tingkat pertama orang yang cerdas dan berbakat bisa berhasil dalam waktu tujuh tahun orang biasa harus menggunakan waktu empat belas tahun
5526911 inilah sin kang tingkat kedua orang cerdas dan berbakat bisa berhasil dalam waktu tujuh tahun orang biasa harus menggunakan waktu sedikitnya empat belas tahun manakala sesudah berlatih dua puluh satu tahun masih belum mendapat kemajuan orang itu dilarang maju pada tingkat ketiga untuk mencegah kecelakaan yang tidak dapat ditolong lagi
5526912 secara tak sengaja teecoe thio boe kie telah mendapatkan ilmu sin kang dari beng kauw dalam mempelajari ilmu tersebut tujuan teecoe adalah untuk menolong jiwa sendiri dan bukan semata mata ingin mencuri ilmu beng kauw jika teecoe bisa lolos dari tempat berbahaya ini maka dengan menggunakan sin kang teecoe akan berusaha sekeras kerasnya guna kepentingan beng kauw teecoe pasti takkan melupakan budi para kauwcoe yang sudah menolong jiwa teecoe

5526918 memang benar ada tiga belas kalimat yang dilompati dan dalam keseluruhannya masih terdapat suatu kekurangan tapi sebagaimana dikatakan dalam nyanyianmu sendiri dalam dunia ini tak ada sesuatu yang sempurna mengapa aku ini tak bisa merasa puas apakah jasa dan kemuliaannya thio boe kie sehingga ia mesti memiliki seluruh ilmu dari beng kauw aku menganggap pantas sekali jika aku tak berhasil dalam tiga belas kalimat itu
5526919 aku hanya ingin tahu kalimat apa yang sedemikian sukar sehingga tak dapat dipecahkan olehmu sendiri

5527052 we provided a screen for the strike group against submarines and also conducted maritime interdiction operations mio
5527053 the reason for this operation was to help prepare the crew for our upcoming deployment
5527054 the underway period went well as expected but i am really glad to be back
5527055 being underway was suspenseful and treacherous because we were practicing a lot of drills they really got to be monotonous but it is understood that if and when an emergency situation arises each sailor will be equipped with vital knowledge to help save the ship and crew
5527056 lets just put the program on the ground and see if it works
5527057 why did intelligence civil affairs psyop and special forces allow their turf to be trampled on by tradoc dcsint why allow so much money to be wasted when those elements could have used it better
5527058 since shes been with the hts program she has been a dedicated and committed professional
5527059 as pointed out from the start the weak points were and remain training and recruitment for anthropologists and military team members there is a heavy price tag of 110 000 and upwards of 200 000 for htt leaders per deployment but lots of academias best will not be swayed by dollars where are the assets for recruitment
5527060 as usual the fobbits forward operating base personnel who never leave the base and remfs rear echelon mother f are in charge and the guys on the line are ignored who needs a combat veteran when youve got google looks like we got out at the right time
5527061 i think we do need an hts program albeit better managed
5527062 all in all it was quite enjoyable for me to observe iraqis and soldiers enjoying each others company unfortunately the hts program managers never asked me to brief them on any successes i had while deployed it may not have been on the grand scale of building a soccer field in a remote village but it was an important step to building trusting relationships
5527063 are studying politics which has some cultural elements but not culture in the restricted sense most of the htt reports are boilerplate personnel recruiting vetting etc
5527064 there is something wrong here this was a super concept but the hts program management did not have the people to execute or support the hts concept no one is in charge at the higher levels and there is no way to get rid of anyone they were told early on that someone would die because they anthropologists social scientists are not qualified for military operations and do not understand where they fit in with the military or recognize just how dangerous the environment they are in is they are allowed to go their own way
5527065 why wasnt she calling the lead anthropologist dr mcfate or a field advisor who is managing or advising the htts once they are deployed into combat
5527066 they htts become the responsibility of the military unit to which they are assigned
5527067 you cant attack all the people in the program some making a living some trying hard but to say that attacking the armys tradoc hts program is un american is wrong its leadership that has caused all these problems if anything questioning a program gone wrong is pro american and pro army many want to see things done right its a leadership problem much attention has been paid in the media to questioning team members qualifications yet no one has questioned the qualifications of the program leaders

5527072 weve reached the end of the road but we have a responsibility to provide for these children
5527073 we have some wonderful staff and kids here they are making it happen
5527074 this is how we have chosen to work towards the changing needs of our children

5527089 this type of event puts down town hamil town on the map and makes it an item of international interest
5527090 i dont think this fits into that model i certainly dont think the council would be going out of its way to attract or support them
5527091 well its a tough situation because first off hes a good football player
5527092 he played very well in arizona hes a good special teams player as well coming this late to a camp is tough but well watch him on the scout team stuff he did today assess our situation as we move forward and hopefully we can give him a chance to be competitive here before camp is over
5527093 its my eighth season im a special teams guy an offensive guy i can fit in pretty much wherever they need me
5527094 its kind of different wearing a texans helmet but im happy to be here
5527095 i want to contribute to the team and be a part of something
5527096 theres no one who wanted to see a change more than me i stepped up to make a difference to get things on track and i think weve been very successful so far
5527097 seaborne threats such as armed robbery piracy drug smuggling human trafficking and terrorism are real
5527098 many of these threats cross international borders requiring likeminded maritime forces to cooperate and share real time information to keep the world safe
5527099 the united states maritime strategy is founded on the tenets of engagement and interoperability linking global stability to the ideals of cooperation and maritime partnerships
5527100 our strategy seeks to enhance security of the maritime domain respond to the full spectrum of crises and to ensure we are prepared for any uncertainty in the future
5527101 this deployment presented us with an opportunity to make new friends friends who have many of the same goals and challenges fellow mariners who share a calling to protect our nations to keep the sea safe and open for our global economy to prosper and to provide assistance when our fellow man is suffering from a natural disaster
5527102 thats a big job for all of us no one can do it alone
5527103 the first phase of panamax is our work up phase
5527104 it allows us to work the kinks out of our systems flex our communications and generally re familiarize ourselves with the capabilities of our force after the work up phase we shift to the exercise scenario phase esp in the esp we will see multiple attempts by terrorist forces trying to attack the canal transfer contraband through the canal and generally disrupt the flow of goods through the canal our job is first to identify these threats and second to eliminate them or mitigate their impact
5527105 our biggest challenge is finding suitable targets on which to perform maritime interdiction operations mio and visit boarding search and seizure vbss
5527106 most of our training is done on other warships panamax allows us the opportunity to do boardings on commercial vessels contracted specifically for that purpose it also allows us to see different ways of handling some of our other warfare areas providing important lessons in surface warfare and multinational and joint interoperability
5527107 twenty nations coordinating to come together and work together for an 11 day span is amazing in itself were really strengthening the relationships between all of these participating navies
5527108 in the event of a real world situation requiring a multinational effort the groundwork were laying here will be invaluable
5527109 there are some places where the russians are not interacting at all where they are aggressive touchy almost ready to engage in a firefight with the georgians and there are other places where on the contrary they appear quite friendly
5527110 i was in the small georgian town of kaspi where there were several places in the town where the russians had taken up positions with tanks and armored personnel carriers and their soldiers were wandering around freely now some of them were ossetian as well and they were interacting quite happily with the local population chatting with them discussing the issues discussing whether it was right for them to be there at all in the first place
5527111 the growing suspicion is that ethnic cleansing is still going on and on august 17 i met a french correspondent who had been in the area of akol gori which is part of georgia proper northwest of tbilisi by about 35 kilometers and just a few kilometers from the south ossetian border and which is the new point or relocation for russian troops
5527112 and there were hundreds of ossetian irregulars marauding through georgian villages there
5527113 there are stories of murders rapes burning of houses thefts of property driving off of cattle and kidnapping
5527114 human rights watch which is the only independent human rights organization so far to get into the area has confirmed many of those reports
5527115 we saw those people working in the city cleaning up debris after the bombings we were told by representatives of the authorities unofficially that those people were indeed detained and that they were hauling debris in the city voluntarily
5527116 understandably we were not able to speak to any of those people to our regret
5527117 but i think it is very important today to clarify their status whether they are detained civilians or prisoners of war
5527118 in some villages as many as 90 percent of the homes looked ruined
5527119 a tank guns barrel has crashed through the entrance to the university
5527120 in the city of gori there is not a single russian soldier
5527121 several armored russian vehicles in gori and several other trucks loaded with what appeared to be enlisted men
5527122 some people began to hope that maybe they were beginning to pull out
5527123 but it looks like what happened is that those russian armored vehicles and troops simply circled the town doing their so called patrolling and then returned to their positions at checkpoints where theyve been stationed thus far
5527124 russia has finished the operation on halting georgias aggression against south ossetia
5527125 they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places
5527126 if they call this a pullout then i do not understand the meaning of the word
5527127 the russians have said that their withdrawal would start at midday today
5527128 we will continue to closely monitor russian actions in georgia for confirmation of the withdrawal
5527129 i appeal to you and i demand from you that russian occupation forces should leave the territory of georgia immediately
5527130 i appeal to you that after your armed forces leave georgian territory you start serious thinking and discussion about further negotiations to start a further search for ways of building up relations and ways to not ruin the relations between our countries forever but now the occupation must end
5527131 i hope the international community will show itself fully ready capable and willing to help provide critically needed assistance to the people of georgia
5527132 while the most acute phase of the violence appears to have passed until there a firm peace in the country we must be prepared to respond to a critical and fluctuating humanitarian situation
5527133 a nd its very difficult to find someone who can speak for the whole country
5527134 we do not consider it possible to wait anymore for emergency assistance that has failed to arrive for a week now
5527135 the american delegation did not even show up at a preparatory committee meeting
5527136 the reluctance of our u s partners to respond to questions from russia in the presence of our european partners
5527137 to discuss the situation in georgia and its implications for the region
5527138 in warsaw secretary rice will sign a formal agreement with poland on behalf of the united states for the establishment and operation of a ballistic missile defense interceptor site in poland this agreement is an important step in our efforts to protect the united states and our european allies from the growing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles
5527139 the deployment of new missile defense elements in europe has the russian federation as its aim
5527140 events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
5527141 as far as general musharrafs crimes are concerned nawaz sharif has said that he has forgiven all the injustices against himself
5527142 but the crimes against the pakistani nation against pakistans judiciary against the rule of law and democracy in pakistan those cannot be forgiven by a person or a party
5527143 will have a positive effect on the strengthening of civilian government institutions and democracy in pakistan afghanistan hopes that pakistan has a stable democracy based upon the rule of law
5527144 musharrafs role was by the end of the day very ambivalent he was seen as the ally of the united states and a symbol of stability in the region but was he really such a symbol was he part of the problem or was he part of the solution
5527145 more and more observers came to the conclusion that musharraf himself was part of the problem therefore his resignation today signifies more confusion
5527146 but it will not necessarily lead this part of the world into immediate chaos he was part of the problem and part of the problem is resigning today
5527147 unfortunately the vision one has of pakistan right now is an extremely negative one
5527148 the future is very bleak the economic situation is confused the political situation is even more confused and the security situation is deteriorating so unfortunately it looks like a dark spot on the planet
5527149 i am pleased that musharraf has resigned it is pleasant news for our country we wanted deep in our hearts for him to go
5527150 i am very happy that the president has resigned it is good news for the safeguarding of the country because the situation had become very bad
5527151 and i hope god willing that the situation will improve after his resignation
5527152 until the afghan file has been transferred from pakistans army and intelligence to the foreign ministry in islamabad which is the civilian government we cannot say that the situation will improve in afghanistan as a result of musharrafs resignation
5527153 its very clear that we need to ensure that there are stringent reporting lines for civilian government oversight of the isi but youve got to do it the right way
5527154 there is a defense cabinet committee you have committees in the parliament in the senate etc that is the avenue available and part of the institutional assertion constitutional supremacy of the parliament means that the parliament also gets down to serious work and strengthens itself
5527155 so that issue remains there and is very crucial and important to pakistanis themselves
5527156 if he had stayed in power there would have been a crisis there would have been a campaign against him for impeachment his resignation was necessary at this moment in time
5527157 it is as if the flag of islam has been raised
5527158 musharraf was an idiot he was not the right person god knows whose agent he was the americans or someone else he didnt do anything good for us in the past five six even seven years
5527159 we need verification of withdrawal and cease fire preferably by eu and osce monitors we need humanitarian aid reaching everybody and then in the end we need peacekeepers taking over conflict areas and doing genuine post conflict resolution in the interest of all ethnic groups
5527160 i came here with two children i dont know where is my husband and my father in law i am very nervous i lost them somewhere on the way
5527161 i am here with two children i dont know what to do next i saw my 15 year old relative laying on the street i couldnt burry him
5527162 wants a much tougher punishment for musharraf which the pakistan peoples party is trying to avoid
5527163 there is also continuing disagreement over the war on terror and how to pursue it especially with the militant factions expanding in pakistan
5527164 so the first dispute is going to be between the coalition partners the second dispute is really going to be between the army and the civilian government
5527165 the army will want to have a say in all these issues thirdly it will be very important to see that the public demand that the government become more effective is met by the government how the government manages to achieve that we dont yet know
5527166 now the american pressure on the civilian government to get tough with the taliban and with terrorists is going to be much harsher much sharper
5527167 and the american government is going to expect that its support to the civilian government in getting rid of musharraf is now rewarded by a more firm policy by the civilian government toward the extremists and that the army and the civilian government work much more closely together but there is serious doubt if that is really going to be achievable in the short term
5527168 afghanistan is also an area where both the army and the civilian government dont see eye to eye
5527169 the army is very defensive of the isi while the civilian government is very critical of the isi so again on both these fronts its going to be a very long haul before the army and the civilian government really come together and work together
5527170 today in line with the peace plan we have begun the pullback of russian peacekeepers and their reinforcements
5527171 favorable conditions have been created to start the pullback of troops to designated areas however we are aware that georgia is capable of provocation at any moment against both our troops and civilians
5527172 after receiving an order for a withdrawal from south ossetia we have started to load military equipment and are preparing to move
5527173 no matter what happened between us georgia is always open to settling all problems through dialogue or talks based on civilized relations
5527174 you will not attain your goal which has already been made clear to everyone georgia will not fall apart tbilisi has not run empty the government is in place the georgian army has not been and will not be destroyed most importantly the georgians spirit has not been broken
5527175 as soon as your army leaves georgia we should start considering further talks to find an appropriate format of further contacts so that our countries do not get finally isolated
5527176 people are going to be coming into the city to see this and be part of it and anything that gets people into the city and opening their wallets gives shops a chance to make sales
5527177 this type of event puts down town hamil town on the map and makes it an item of international interest

5527184 perhaps its a sign of the rising fortunes of waikato farmers that the citys main street has sprouted a sophisticated and vibrant stretch of bars and eateries that on the weekend at least leave aucklands viaduct harbour for dead in the boozy fun stakes

5527192 any meaningful steps to establish and maintain maori participation in decision making
5527193 this is not really against the council its against the government
5527194 were making the claim under the treaty to make them central government responsible and hold them accountable for the legislation that they have passed
5527195 to simply fabricate a bad relationship and then slap a treaty claim on it its not a good look
5527196 we obviously dont support those views and we have found it difficult to find anything else to discuss
5527197 that has to happen in order for us to get where we want to go thats a challenge
5527198 what ive noticed this year more so than any other year is that we have a lot of unity theres no egos and everybody is trying to work together so we can grow as a group its really working out well so far
5527199 were more athletic as a defense in years past we may have had more experience than we do now but well get to that point once we mentally get everything down and gain more experience we have a chance to be even better
5527200 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5527201 i think you can expect a strong message to russia
5527202 decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era

5527205 this study will potentially demonstrate that it is the regimen of administration of birth control pills rather than their specific formulation that results in successful treatment of pmdd
5527206 if we can eliminate the hormone cycling we should eliminate the pmdd symptoms
5527207 theyre regulators of mood and emotion so if you can eliminate the metabolites that have been implicated in pmdd you may create a huge benefit for women with pmdd
5527208 we believe this trial will help us understand the underlying physiology which will allow for the development of a range of possible new treatments
5527209 id gain weight my face would be puffy i had horrible cramps and that would get me mentally down the symptoms changed as i matured and had children it gradually became more emotional now it also affects my mental acuity and i can still get down sometimes
5527210 the impairment and reduction in quality of life for women with pmdd during their premenstrual phase is equivalent to people with major depression anxiety disorder and even post traumatic stress disorder
5527211 if we can show that continuous low dose contraceptives are effective that opens up another option that may have a better risk benefit profile than ssris
5527212 many women in our previous studies felt better knowing they were contributing to furthering our knowledge about this disorder and informing subsequent treatment options
5527213 we can give them a gold standard diagnosis if they do have pmdd and if they have something else we can help them find treatment for it
5527214 i know what to do and where to go i have all the information and i know help is there theres such a peace of mind from that
5527215 the more we understand the better we can treat it and the better for everyone
5527216 there is so much lost productivity in women with pmdd just think how much more a woman could accomplish if she didnt have to lose so much of herself and her energy every month

5527221 in the scope of a year the price of oil has doubled and prices in the 90 a barrel range are quickly becoming normalized
5527222 economic consensus outlook remain steadfast in their belief that the economy will continue forward into the year ahead though at a slower rate
5527223 but as 2008 began american drivers were paying more than 3 a gallon and crude oil hit a milestone 100 a barrel some oil experts warn of even bigger price shocks to come as oil producing nations use more and more of their own oil and energy demand jumps 50 percent by 2030

5527245 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5527246 we are on a clear road towards nato membership for georgia
5527247 i am looking forward to the speedy withdrawal of russian troops which has not yet happened as we had expected
5527248 to show that we support the georgian people and also the government to deal with the work there is to do
5527249 the security zone is temporary this is not disputed by any of the parties
5527250 it is more important that foreign observers arrive so it is not only troops of the commonwealth of independent states cis
5527251 there is no such notion anymore in georgia as russian peacekeepers there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces
5527252 it seems that labours unpopular plans for a national road pricing scheme are alive and well
5527253 they are determined to press ahead with their untried and untested spy in the sky national project even though it looks like an it disaster waiting to happen ruth kelly should start listening to drivers and scrap these pilots for a national road pricing scheme that is unnecessary and unwanted
5527254 if the government was true to its word and was kicking road pricing into the long grass why is it running trials
5527255 ministers have said that national road pricing is no longer on the agenda so either they are wasting millions of pounds of taxpayers money or they are not being honest with voters
5527256 we have been absolutely clear that any proposal for national road pricing would need to address the legitimate concerns people have

5527309 the doctrine of repentance is the missing note in many otherwise and fundamentally sound circles today
5527310 the necessity of repentance lest it seem to invalidate the freedom of grace
5527311 a change or alteration of mind hebrews 12 17 repentance change or mind from evil to good or from worse to better matthew 3 11 9 13 textus receptus acts 20 21
5527312 a change of of mind or attitude concerning either god christ dead works or sin
5527313 if repentance is a requirement for salvation then the actual number of genuine believers is very small
5527314 they realized he was calling them to admit their sin and turn from it to be converted to turn around to forsake their sin and selfishness and follow him instead
5527315 beware of false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves
5527316 not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but the one who does the will of my father who is in heaven
5527317 do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure is there your heart will be also
5527318 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5527319 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5527320 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5527321 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5527322 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5527323 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5527324 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5527325 it aint easy long john baldry and the birth of british blues
5527326 thank you for traveling air enjoy your stay in la habana where the current time is 4 47pm
5527327 i want to bounce over moguls like the raindrops in chile bounce across your breasts
5527328 he can only stay the night then he has to leave think of the children
5527329 youve got to be shitting me why dont you call my cousin he said hed give you a job at starbucks
5527330 everybody hates starbucks you just have a bad reason they took over your taco bell and that taco bell was the only one who would still make the cheesarito
5527331 it was a good line now you just embarrass yourself with it like youre doing out on the street selling fucking poems tyler why dont you just keep submitting to the
5527332 they dont reply anymore they just send me offers to subscribe completely ignoring my submissions
5527333 you shouldnt have written them hate mail every time they rejected you
5527334 it wasnt hate mail it was more desperate pleas for a sympathy publication
5527335 go sell your poems on the street then hows it going out there i guess ill ask
5527336 get your fat ass out there and you can have wine after youve sold ten poems
5527337 i dont have 500 what kind of poems are you selling
5527338 the album is a pure adrenaline shot of pumped up beats as vibrant as a high definition rainbow after an electrical storm its a hi nrg voyage from the shores of madonna to the temples of fatboy slim via the electroclash of felix da housecat
5527339 this is a name that im sure will be on the lips of the masses in the not too distant future salme excels at purveying great energetic electronic pop with a very distinct nod to fatboy slim and his ilk
5527340 my idea was to write catchy pop songs with big hooks and dress them up in a cutting edge electronic production
5527341 i love the sound of fatboy slim and the crystal method and artists like that and i wanted my songs to have the same excitement and edge production wise
5527342 i take music very seriously but i try not to take myself too seriously dahlstrom says i am here to have a good time to me music is about entertainment nothing else the acid cowgirl audio trade is meant to be an hours escape from the day to day its got great sing a long choruses and fun tongue in cheek lyrics with attitude thatll put a smile on your face
5527343 ive never heard such a stylish blend of disparate influences whats surprising is that it all just works hmm suddenly works sounds understated its way better than chocolate and its got attitude too i am honored to make the acquaintance of a trendsetter
5527344 heres an artist who doesnt give a shit about following trends or rules she does whatever the hell she feels like and doesnt apologize for it and the result is one of the most refreshing and innovative albums ive heard in a long time maybe as far back as when becks loser first came out
5527345 the album is slickly stylized with catchy hooks being the focal point
5527346 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5527347 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5527348 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5527349 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5527350 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5527351 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from mexico youd think we would want to pay more attention
5527352 come on now lets put things into prospective we are not dealing with life and death here
5527353 we are preparing a complete response to the sba and expect to be exonerated as far what the gao is saying
5527354 we do all of the engineering in greenbelt every day
5527355 theres a lot of turnover in people but if you call there are people there
5527356 we created the bogus companies to test fraud controls the gateway to the money
5527357 what could be causing idle shaking on a 1990 audi coupe quatro
5527358 talk to your legislators about giving sex offenders life sentences and be done with it
5527359 how can i get my 01 audi tt windshield washers to work again
5527360 how can a audi cvt transmission have tiptronic shifting mine does not seem to shift when i use tiptronic
5527361 we dont look at this as a car ad as much as we look at it as a statement
5527362 the message we want to send is between old world and new world and say that audi is the new world the spot sets up old luxury as excessive extravagance audi is not about excess its about substance
5527363 the fact that people dont pay attention to auto ads unless they are in the market for a car is exactly the ammunition we used to do something different and provocative
5527364 we have this slow methodical open its eerie and not a gag a minute the light bulb is going to go off that its the godfather all those things contribute to a pause thats going to deliver an entertaining story and brand message
5527365 si dios sabe lo que va a hacer ma ana entonces no puede cambiar su futuro por lo tanto no es omnipotente
5527366 otra de las caracter sticas de dios es que es soberano lo cual quiere decir que tiene la absoluta libertad de hacer como l desee
5527367 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5527368 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5527369 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5527370 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5527371 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5527372 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5527373 the world has seen that even today there are political morons who are ready to kill innocent and defenseless people in order to satisfy their self serving interests while compensating for their own inability to resolve complicated issues by using the most terrible solution by exterminating an entire people
5527374 i think that there should be no mercy for that we will do our best not to let this crime go unpunished
5527375 you just dont move more than 1 200 tanks and 15 000 soldiers into a country within 12 hours without previous planning
5527376 were talking about pulling our troops away to the borders of south ossetia they will not be on georgia territory
5527377 russians have committed to withdrawing and they need to withdraw and so that is what we are looking for
5527378 we were all set and then the georgians came up with a bunch of new requirements with no time for us to act so the time to exchange prisoners was interrupted
5527379 russian forces continue to consolidate their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia
5527380 mounting evidence that russian and georgian military used armed force unlawfully during the south ossetian conflict
5527381 highlights the need for international fact finding missions in georgia
5527382 i want to see the data i want to see the valid scientific links made
5527383 the fbi needs to explain why it zeroed in on ivins how he could have made the anthrax mailed to lawmakers and the media and how he or anyone else could have pulled off the attacks acting alone
5527384 obviously looking at it in hindsight we would do things differently today
5527385 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps those are the lessons learned
5527386 in hindsight it would have been useful to have saved it
5527387 the anthrax probe helped to found the field of bioforensics
5527388 do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa
5527389 i have been talking to new york but there are six teams i talk to about once a week he still hasnt decided if he is going to play this year thats stage one stage two will be picking a team we havent had that discussion yet
5527390 everybody has been calling regularly trying to get an idea of when his timetable is mainly i have just told them we have talked about everything and right now its just for him to decide

5527395 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5527396 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5527397 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5527398 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5527399 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5527400 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5527401 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5527402 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5527403 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5527404 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5527405 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5527406 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5527407 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5527408 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5527409 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias

5527415 vence el plazo para las negociaciones y tenemos acuerdos con dos empresas pero lamentablemente no ha sido posible una negociaci n con cemex y entrar en vigencia la medida de expropiaci n
5527416 en la medianoche de hoy lunes tomaremos el control operacional de las instalaciones de cemex
5527417 lo que pretend a cemex est muy por encima de sus capacidades requer an m s de 1 200 millones de d lares
5527418 cemex arrastra serios problemas de eficiencia en materia ambiental y en materia fiscal y eso hay que ponerlo en orden
5527419 vamos a tomar las plantas cementeras esta medianoche porque se acab el plazo y pasan a manos del estado como pas la sider rgica del orinoco sidor como pas la faja del orinoco como pas la compa a de tel fonos de venezuela todo eso son pasos al socialismo
5527420 maakt ons product het makkelijker voor jullie scholieren om uiteindelijk bij de juiste opleiding terecht te komen
5527421 its nothing i can control and honestly i can say it has been very fair to me and i got the biggest gold medal of them all
5527422 im a little sad but at the same time its great to have four olympic medals
5527423 i turned to my dad and said dad we got the same score he looked up and said oh yeah we started getting a little confused
5527424 its not correct i believe its correct to have two gold medals
5527425 but this is my modest opinion the ioc is different
5527426 im not sure if anybody understands what the hell is going on
5527427 it wasnt like i got second by three tenths or five tenths i had the same score thats what makes it a little harder to take
5527428 in other sports like track and field its all timed and it doesnt have anything to do with judging you do your routine and you turn it over to the judges thats what weve been going through our entire lives and weve come to accept it
5527429 shes an excellent athlete no matter how old she is
5527430 shes done her hard work and her preparation she definitely deserved her gold medal
5527431 i play by the rules so in my opinion i have to say yes
5527432 judges have their own opinion and once you land your dismount theres nothing else you can do
5527433 i have the most important medal and its the all around gold
5527434 i have four medals now and im tied with my dad one gold two silvers and a bronze and i have one more chance to get one gold that i feel like i missed out on today
5527435 the perception of jobs that he designs products in the middle of the night and builds them during the day has served apple well
5527436 people look at steve jobs in a lot of different ways being a good ceo being a good innovator being the messiah most of those perceptions are hard to shake
5527437 this is about one person giving a focused message and he delivers it very well
5527438 there are very few people that can deliver a message like steve other ceos only wish they had a fraction of the charisma that steve has
5527439 apple gets appointed as some kind of a poster child for that
5527440 but its not that far off from the normal culture
5527441 its a cultural style issue thats been in apples dna almost from the companys beginning
5527442 in almost every case even with john sculley michael spindler gil amelio apple ceos emerge as the company face and the public image
5527443 apples an 18 billion company it didnt get there because of one man
5527444 whoever leads the company is going to have to be part of the apple culture you cant come in and learn it
5527445 to that degree steves doing a great job of building that cultural acclimation into his leadership staff if wall street truly understood that the company is driven by both vision and execution any impact from a future jobs departure will be minimized

5527448 i wanted to keep the pain to myself son but now it cuts straight through me do you understand it cuts straight through me
5527449 i found that even 2 500 years ago sophocles was using words like shell shocked and the thousand yard stare those are things that you hear today
5527450 i know its a bit odd to have greek plays read to a conference of military people
5527451 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
5527452 i dont know if the readings are going to get anyone to admit they have a problem my goal is to open up a space for dialogue
5527453 we know that greek drama was theater for combat veterans by combat veterans

5527455 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5527456 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5527457 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5527458 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5527459 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5527460 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5527461 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5527462 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5527463 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5527464 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5527465 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5527466 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5527467 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5527468 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5527469 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5527470 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5527471 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5527472 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5527473 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5527474 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5527475 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5527476 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5527477 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5527478 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5527479 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5527480 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5527481 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5527482 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5527483 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5527484 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5527485 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5527486 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5527487 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5527488 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5527489 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5527490 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5527491 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5527492 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5527493 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5527494 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5527495 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5527496 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5527497 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5527498 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5527499 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5527500 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5527501 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5527502 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5527503 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5527504 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5527505 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5527506 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta

5527508 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5527509 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5527510 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5527511 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5527512 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5527513 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
5527514 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
5527515 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer

5527518 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5527519 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5527520 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5527521 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5527522 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5527523 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5527524 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5527525 the governor better play nice or the legislature will give him a spankin
5527526 i think the senate president had the governors back more times than was the best interest of public policy
5527527 i think its a bad thing for gov blagojevich in light of jones being his strongest defender in the capitol
5527528 emil jones used his position as senate president to give those without a voice better health care better funded schools and increases in the minimum wage emil jones is a man with a big heart and a man of action he is a true champion of the people he didnt just do the talk he did the walk all of us in illinois owe him a great debt of gratitude
5527529 this has been a great privilege to work on behalf of the people of illinois for over 35 years
5527530 i want to thank my leadership team and my colleagues in the senate who worked with me side by side to accomplish many things for the people of illinois
5527531 with emil in office it has always been assumed that he would stand in the way of any effort to remove the governor from office with jones leaving who knows what will happen
5527532 i hope we get someone in there with some leadership skills
5527533 well let him ride ponies hes got lifts in his shoes
5527534 when i give him a hug hes always in my armpit so ive got to make sure ive got deodorant on
5527535 deepak said he was going to get even i told him have at it i told him not to hurt anybody but it should be funny adit didnt want a party it was my ambition to have a party dont write anything we are simple people i just need everybodys blessings
5527536 sven sundgaard is not coming to wcco to my knowledge and i think id know i think he does fine work but nope hes not coming to work here unless somebody out there hired him without my knowledge that would be news
5527537 hes not my real brother but my father knows his father he was from his village which is just a short way away
5527538 will he be the next president of the united states
5527539 los beb s me han hecho hasta m s ambiciosa he encontrado una nueva inspiraci n
5527540 siempre me han gustado los deportes particip en el equipo de atletismo cuando estaba en la escuela y es por eso que me digo a m misma que s puedo hacer esto
5527541 el equipo fue una parte importante de mi vida en ese momento y me ense muchas cosas cuando contemplo mi vida y las cosas que he podido hacer lo debo en parte a ese entrenamiento temprano que me ense disciplina dedicaci n resistencia y empe o para ganar
5527542 es probable que tenga que arrastrarme para cruzar la l nea de llegada pero terminar la carrera
5527543 dont look up just let them think theres no place else youd rather be
5527544 and its obvious that youre dying dying just living proof that the cameras lying
5527545 nobodys going to be able if theyve been campaigning as hard as we have been to keep up with every single thing from what happened to
5527546 if i was to come to 3rd and pike and see this thing not here it would just kill me
5527547 president of the united states shot today read all about it president shot today
5527548 the only reason this newsstand got to be here was because of frank turcos 47 years on 3rd and pike
5527549 we got the little nickel the asian weekly and russian world news which we sell for 25 cents

5527565 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5527566 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5527567 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5527568 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5527569 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5527570 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5527571 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5527572 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5527573 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5527574 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5527575 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5527576 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5527577 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5527578 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5527579 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

5527617 me dijeron que probablemente hubo un error pero a m esto no me sorprende porque mi construcci n era la nica que inspeccionaba la municipalidad y tambi n fui al nico que le aplicaron multas por infracciones al c digo de planeamiento urbano
5527618 aprovech la plata de la indemnizaci n para hacer una casa de material y entonces empezaron las inspecciones y las multas que siempre pagu porque mi inter s era regularizar la situaci n
5527619 yo quiero comprar el terreno pero nunca me atendieron y solo pude canalizar mi reclamo a trav s del concejo tampoco estoy en un lugar donde mi casa est obstaculizando una obra o cosa por el estilo en realidad esto es una persecuci n por mi condici n de militante social del justicialismo

5527621 we were quite astonished to read reports of what she had said
5527622 we never accused her of voting we accused her of disregarding the constitution that she is bound to serve by expressing her approval of the process she is expressing approval of morgentalers activism on abortion
5527623 dr mcvety said that as the chair of a committee that is instrumental in conferring honours on individuals some of whom may represent controversial causes that could come before the supreme court the chief justices independence is automatically compromised
5527624 sure 90 of science fiction is crud thats because 90 of everything is crud
5527625 as a mom you will always worry even when they are grown and married
5527626 for all we know there is a gay rower or badminton player somewhere known as gay within his or her sport but not in a larger public context
5527627 its everybody else who thinks its special when homosexuality and elite sport go together
5527628 the vast majority of olympic athletes are under 30 a time when even people who are not elite jocks are wrestling with their sexuality
5527629 being an olympic athlete requires full time dedication and a lot of things get put on hold it is just easier to hide and deal with ones sexuality later
5527630 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light

5527633 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5527634 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5527635 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5527636 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5527637 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5527638 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5527639 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5527640 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5527641 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5527642 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5527643 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5527644 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5527645 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5527646 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5527647 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5527648 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5527649 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5527650 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5527651 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5527652 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5527653 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5527654 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5527655 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

5527657 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5527658 retailers experimenting with web 2 0 experiences will largely find benefit from them in the form of branding and awareness building rather than direct sales as social media has shown little direct impact on actual online retail sales

5527662 developing our oil sands has had its environmental challenges but weve come a long way
5527663 we will also be introducing tough new regulations that will require even more dramatic cuts
5527664 we tried the inside approach to bringing about change and the government has said yup we hear what youre saying and we agree that these are the problems and yet they havent been willing to step up
5527665 we feel weve exhausted the possibility of working within cema to bring about changes
5527666 i dont think what pembina is saying is that cema does bad scientific work
5527667 i think pembinas frustration and the frustration of the first nations and the frustration of a lot of members is the politics that when things come out it seems to take a long time to see a result
5527668 the whole issue of north american energy security coupled with responsible environmental stewardship are the flip sides of the same issue
5527669 the oil sands are critical to north american energy security and its important that we explain not only to the americans but internationally the responsible way in which those developments are going to unfold
5527670 a lot of people have been waiting for some event like this to come along
5527671 its like being in the matrix only theres no morpheus
5527672 youre plugged in to the truth but youre sort of left standing there by yourself
5527673 in joy we live celebrating swami kriyanandas 60 years of discipleship and anandas 40th anniversary
5527674 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5527675 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5527676 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5527677 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5527678 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5527679 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5527680 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5527681 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5527682 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5527683 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5527684 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5527685 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5527686 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5527687 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5527688 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5527689 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5527690 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5527691 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5527692 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5527693 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5527694 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5527695 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5527696 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5527697 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5527698 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5527699 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5527700 mom do you know how many times i think of my sweet ellie she was so sweet she took care of me when i was a baby tiger when i was three what is the smallest part of gods body is it his pinky we dont know when we are going to die i might die when im as old as ellie was but i might not but we dont know but i probably will or i probably wont you member when i went to that bounce house you know when i had a picture of ellie on my back a cancer relay we went to not very long ago well i told this lady all about ellie that she was my sister and she died from cancer she was the mom of this little boy i was ten hundred and seventy stronger than him he was just a little boy having that picture of ellie on my back made me think about ellie
5527701 i would choose john terry 100 i always have and i always will i went on record before the last world cup that i thought he should have got it then
5527702 he would have been my captain then and nothing has changed since for me he is a great leader a great man and a great footballer
5527703 i have nothing against stevie gerrard who i had the pleasure of playing with on his debut or rio they are both great players but john terry can organise it and lead better than anyone else why has he not already chosen him
5527704 o momento mais agrad vel pode ser tamb m o que mais causa medo
5527705 se caso eleito o nome de vereador vai ser o meu nome mesmo o rola bosta vai ser s mesmo para ser eleito se for eleito eu vou ficar conhecido pelo trabalho que irei realizar
5527706 the department had to dig into that and find out if they could confirm those nine incidents
5527707 i wasnt asking demographic information about age but i can make the best educated guess to tell you that those were actually teens because it was like harry plus hermoine forever skaterchick612 you know when an adult is subscribing to a list john smith at gmail dot com you know when some in their teens is subscribing skater girls forever
5527708 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5527709 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5527710 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5527711 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5527712 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5527713 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5527714 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items

5527724 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

5527728 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5527729 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5527730 nobody in the general public actually cares about john edwards or his unsavory behavior edwards became ancient history the first five minutes after this thing broke
5527731 democrats and republicans have been reduced to yelping angrily at one another over differences so comically trivial that one wonders seriously about their sanity
5527732 in other words there is presently a huge disconnect between the paper market and the physical market
5527733 not a fan of 1000 oz bars for the average client since shipping them back to distributors is a nightmare if the bar packs higher than 75 pounds in a flat rate priority mail box using registered mail just about the only method for retail customer to ship with insurance unless they have such a large quantity that distributor will arrange a carrier pickup at a business address

5527736 i would hope that the authorities make sure that gary glitter does not slip off to another country
5527737 once youre overseas you can just go from country to country we know that some of the most high risk offenders do that
5527738 glitter is a persistent offender responsible for a catalogue of sexual crimes against children on his return to the uk the authorities must assess the level of risk he poses to children and make sure he is carefully managed and supervised in the community to keep children safe from harm
5527739 it is not business as usual it has damaged its standing

5527745 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5527746 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5527747 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

5527749 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5527750 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5527751 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5527752 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

5527754 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5527755 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5527756 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5527757 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5527758 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5527759 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5527760 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5527761 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5527762 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5527763 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5527764 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5527765 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5527766 if they keep on saying that line and they continue to fail controlling them milf sub commanders then the government will certainly control them
5527767 that statement of the milf that the activities of its commanders are not sanctioned by them its very unfortunate we cannot forever take that convenient excuse from the hierarchy of a group thats supposedly talking peace with the government
5527768 the leadership failed to prevent the action yesterday morning nonetheless when we made direct contact we were able to convince them to retreat around noon
5527769 we have been exerting our effort to pacify this milf group

5527785 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5527786 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5527787 i am sure that such a well conducted effective peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5527788 the world realized that even now there are political freaks who were ready to kill innocent people for the sake of political fashions and who compensated for their own stupidity by eliminating a whole nation
5527789 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly

5527793 the recent disturbing developments have stirred the peace caused the loss of lives and property and threaten the well being of our brothers and sisters particularly in the towns of kolambugan kauswagan and some barangays in maigo
5527794 as your shepherd i appeal and pray for peace let us not let these unconscionable acts of violence deter us from our determined striving for genuine and lasting peace i also would like you to know that i strongly condemn these indiscriminate displays of violence and terrorist acts as well as those who started these
5527795 let us not let fear overcome us instead let us stay calm but vigilant and continue to trust our duly constituted authority as they do their best in protecting us from harm
5527796 my heart goes also to the victims and their families may they find help and courage to move on i also appreciate your generosity if you could extend a helping hand to the victims

5527812 the first thing to keep in mind is that we have some semantic confusion as is usual at this stage of a new market around just what is a cloud
5527813 ibm has finally enunciated a vision for its cloud computing that makes sense for ibm and its customers it offers a very high end version of cloud computing virtually unlimited amounts of power up to and including mainframe systems backed by its
5527814 ibm actually offers even more choices that may be less obvious
5527815 it was reported last week that microsoft is moving to the cloud
5527816 microsoft has other online perhaps cloud services such as its live services and new live mesh service for synchronizing devices of every kind it is also testing a consumer version of office that will combine a basic version of desktop office with an array of online services
5527817 last friday i spoke with workday a saas erp company ive been tracking since its start
5527818 you can access a cloud as pure computing power a place to load an application that needs lots of computing or requires cyclical peaks
5527819 you can find a cloud that provides a platform with apis to support an ecosystem of isvs who provide software that you find appealing
5527820 you can choose a cloud whose platform includes an application salesforce com that attracts other isvs to surround it
5527821 you can simply find a saas vendor whose application is appealing you dont care about the cloud behind it just the application
5527822 you can build your own cloud managed by a vendor or your own it staff for some large scale purpose
5527823 and no doubt someone somewhere is dreaming up some other things to do with clouds
5527824 a messy period with many clouds many of them not interoperable because theyre not build to the same standards
5527825 a period of consolidation because we really want to buy our applications in a way that they can be aware of each other and use them in a common environment
5527826 a higher level of standardization where just as we do on the internet today any application can be used with any other application on the platform and through the portal of your choice
5527827 the idea of trying to utilize the white spaces from a consumer perspective would be a good win for everyone
5527828 google has a clear business interest in expanding access to the web theres no doubt that if these airwaves are opened up to unlicensed use more people will be using the internet thats certainly good for google not to mention many of our industry peers but we also think that its good for consumers

5527847 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5527848 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5527849 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5527850 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5527851 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5527852 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from
5527853 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5527854 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5527855 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5527856 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5527857 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern
5527858 methodological well targeted propaganda or unbridled outbursts these images in their own myopic implacable rough ways relate the conflict there are singing videos moments when soldiers wait for an explosion to go off instructions for planting a bomb weapons inspections 4x4 rallies in baghdad etc the daily life of a warrior captured in the harsh brutality of a visor made into a lens without the relief of a counter shot

5527883 hes a very nice combination of speed and power we felt michael with jerious norwood would be a solid one two punch
5527884 hes got home run speed as well as hes got a very low center of gravity
5527885 all you are seeing is shoulder pads and knees theres not a lot of body surface to tackle him
5527886 i just had to deal with it i was patient with it i didnt get discouraged it was more of a mental thing i had to overcome not being the no 1 guy
5527887 he told me it was my turn he told me i was ready
5527888 he saw some stuff in me that made him feel i was ready
5527889 a guy starting out as an auto technician can make 50 grand in the first year
5527890 it can go up to 150 000 its really a wide open field theres a shortage of technicians and its not like the old days where mechanics didnt make a whole lot they can make great money
5527891 the dealers came together and said we need to look at the future and invest in a facility that can continually generate the next generation of employees
5527892 a 28 million state of the art training center was built from the ground up we went to lincoln technical college to start with and they invested 8 million of their own money in the facility
5527893 at the center for automotive education amp training we basically get guys and girls ready to work at dealerships i have one guy here at manhattan motor cars and im gonna hire more nationwide i hear theres a shortage of 70 000 service people
5527894 ive been into cars since i was a kid it was a challenge because a lot of people dont want a kid working on their porsche or rolls royce but brian took a chance on me

5527905 well yeah i mean no one looks good in sparkly spandex and lets face it while i love him hes not the best dancer or singer is he
5527906 yeah and turning out to be gay no wonder he was so embarrassed
5527907 do you seriously think that colin firth would not have known his character was gay before he took the role
5527908 im going to tell everyone that she knows that im gay so that she knows im not ashamed or embarrassed
5527909 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5527910 a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated
5527911 level of objectivity has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5527912 we are concerned that your news division is following msnbcs lead in abandoning nonpartisan coverage of the presidential race
5527913 with all due respect to the campaign leadership they are viewing our coverage through a political prism
5527914 we stand by our reporting our journalism and our journalists

5527931 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5527932 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5527933 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5527934 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5527935 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5527936 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5527937 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5527938 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5527939 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5527940 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5527941 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5527942 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5527943 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5527944 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5527945 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5527946 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5527947 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5527948 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5527949 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5527950 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5527951 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5527952 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5527953 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5527954 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5527955 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5527956 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5527957 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5527958 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5527959 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5527960 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5527961 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5527962 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5527963 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5527964 its not strategy structure culture or systems the core of the matter is always about changing the behaviour of people
5527965 research shows that this idea applies to the business realm as well bain amp co the management consultant firm studied 21 recent corporate transformations and found that most were substantially completed in only two years or less while none took more than three years
5527966 find ways to help others see problems and solutions in ways that influence emotions not just thought
5527967 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5527968 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5527969 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5527970 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5527971 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5527972 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5527973 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5527974 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5527975 well take over the cement plants at midnight because the deadline has come and theyll become state property
5527976 it was not possible to arrive at an agreement with them cemex and the next step that we must take is to proceed with expropriation
5527977 asking a price way above the real price they were asking for more than 1 2 billion dollars
5527978 so tomorrow well go ahead with nationalizing and regaining the cement industries
5527979 this study will potentially demonstrate that it is the regimen of administration of birth control pills rather than their specific formulation that results in successful treatment of pmdd
5527980 if we can eliminate the hormone cycling we should eliminate the pmdd symptoms
5527981 theyre regulators of mood and emotion so if you can eliminate the metabolites that have been implicated in pmdd you may create a huge benefit for women with pmdd
5527982 we believe this trial will help us understand the underlying physiology which will allow for the development of a range of possible new treatments
5527983 id gain weight my face would be puffy i had horrible cramps and that would get me mentally down the symptoms changed as i matured and had children it gradually became more emotional now it also affects my mental acuity and i can still get down sometimes
5527984 the impairment and reduction in quality of life for women with pmdd during their premenstrual phase is equivalent to people with major depression anxiety disorder and even post traumatic stress disorder
5527985 if we can show that continuous low dose contraceptives are effective that opens up another option that may have a better risk benefit profile than ssris
5527986 many women in our previous studies felt better knowing they were contributing to furthering our knowledge about this disorder and informing subsequent treatment options
5527987 we can give them a gold standard diagnosis if they do have pmdd and if they have something else we can help them find treatment for it
5527988 i know what to do and where to go i have all the information and i know help is there theres such a peace of mind from that
5527989 the more we understand the better we can treat it and the better for everyone
5527990 there is so much lost productivity in women with pmdd just think how much more a woman could accomplish if she didnt have to lose so much of herself and her energy every month
5527991 but after eight years of bill clinton and his pro corporate anti new deal republican lite dlc having assumed near complete control of the national party were there any liberals still active enough to be delegates
5527992 whistling past dixie how democrats can win without the south
5527993 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5527994 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5527995 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5527996 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5527997 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5527998 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5527999 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5528000 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5528001 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5528002 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5528003 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5528004 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5528005 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5528006 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5528007 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5528008 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5528009 until a decade ago gay people were seen as a security threat and as recently as two decades ago they were being witch hunted and sacked from the security services
5528010 it was part of the cold war mentality that saw security threats traitors and spies everywhere gay people were regarded as vulnerable to blackmail even if they were open and out about their sexuality
5528011 my recent experience of them is that theyre not spy novelists john le carr graham greene its not that sort of tableau anymore
5528012 as an intelligence officer at mi5 youll be faced with some of the most challenging issues affecting national security
5528013 the decisions you make will play a major part in our efforts to counter terrorism espionage the spread of weapons of mass destruction and in protecting critical national infrastructure
5528014 theyre trying to portray themselves as an open inclusive organization thats working for the good of the community
5528015 it does need diverse members of society to be able to access the diverse members of society that they may have interest in
5528016 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5528017 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5528018 with the quickness a little tale of young black love hardcore style
5528019 july was second highest total for leased space in 2008 and the second month in a row that broke the 1 000 000 square foot thresh hold
5528020 the 1st amendments right to the free exercise of religion does not exempt defendant physicians here from conforming their conduct to the antidiscrimination requirements
5528021 i am not so certain this balance of competing interest would produce the same result in the case of a sole practitioner
5528022 this isnt just a win for me personally and for other lesbian women
5528023 its a win for everyone because anyone could be the next target if doctors are allowed to pick and choose their patients based on religious views about other groups of people
5528024 but they rarely matter in terms of winning a state or region as mike dukakisand john kerry found out and a weak candidate doesnt really drag the ticket into the drink as george h w bush found out
5528025 one of humanitys great conquests is the overcoming of racism unfortunately however there are new and worrying examples of this in various countries often linked to social and economic problems that nonetheless can never justify contempt or racial discrimination
5528026 and therefore also to italy where sorry to say there are many signs of racism that trouble us and which cannot be hidden
5528027 just absolutely shocked and i had never seen anything like this
5528028 to think that this was written on the door as the congregation came together sunday morning is really appalling
5528029 police do believe that these incidents of graffiti maybe related in other words they may have been drawn or written by the same person or group of people
5528030 certainly it is very disturbing people who were in the church were understandably very concerned and very upset we want to do what we can to make an arrest in this case
5528031 one thing that came to my mind was a desire to reach out and say to our neighbors here that this was an anomaly that we want no part of
5528032 im clear absolutely 100 percent clear and clean they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5528033 heavy getting hit over the head with the handle of a knife that doesnt disappear with movie quotes from the dark knight dubbed into team fortress 2
5528034 especially when its a movie that was as well made as dark knight
5528035 dude can you put dark knight in the title so i dont watch it not knowing im walking into a dark knight scene
5528036 his claims have been a staple of old media reports from the beginning but now that stanek has revealed the truth we will have to see if the old media corrects the record or if they suddenly just go mum on the subject like they have so far
5528037 so we are forced to realize that obama knows the truth but is trying to rewrite history and with the willing accomplices in the old media he has succeeded in doing so thus far
5528038 now this story is no matter of mere opinion there is no possibility that obama just has a different opinion on a controversial national issue than we do
5528039 what we have here is obama simply telling a lie and knowingly doing so will the old media continue to cover up for him like they have done for the last four years
5528040 many americans of all political parties will vote for a change in november barack obama is the only candidate who offers that change of direction we need
5528041 if the boxer amendment which sen casey regrettably supported was enacted it would force the removal of family planning funds from private organizations that stick to non abortive methods in order to give those funds to organizations that are committed to the promotion of abortion
5528042 when you look at his opposition to the born alive infants protection act in illinois and the partial birth abortion ban which many mass attending catholics view as bans on infanticide obamas more extreme than any other democratic presidential candidate
5528043 the flood of comments to sec leavitts blog forced him to acknowledge the secret rule the bush administration is considering the first time any administration official has addressed the issue
5528044 in his latest blog post sec leavitt admits that the pressure from planned parenthood supporters like you made it impossible for him to continue to ignore the controversy
5528045 im delighted to announce that with the help of planned parenthood my blog for the first time received more visits than my teenage sons myspace page
5528046 contained what the reviewers described to me as profane language or personal attacks on your body parts religion or family
5528047 if a person goes to medical school they lose their right of conscience freedom of expression and action is surrendered with the issuance of a medical degree
5528048 it is currently a violation of three separate federal laws to compel medical practitioners to perform a procedure that violates their conscience
5528049 obviously some disagree with the federal law and would have it otherwise so they have begun using the accreditation standards of physician professional organizations to define the exercise of conscience unprofessional and thereby make doctors choose between their capacity to practice in good standing and their right of conscience
5528050 this is about the right of a doctor to not participate if he or she chooses for reasons they consider a matter of conscience
5528051 if the department of health and human services issues a regulation on this matter it will aim at one thing protecting the right of conscience of those who practice medicine from what ive read the last few days theres a serious need for it
5528052 elective abortion euthanasia physician assisted suicide the destruction of embryonic human beings in stem cell research and human cloning
5528053 such acts are judged to be intrinsically evil that is evil in and of themselves regardless of our motives or the circumstances they constitute an attack against innocent human life
5528054 in light of the above we would commit moral evil if we were to vote for a candidate who takes a permissive stand on those actions that are intrinsically evil when there is a morally acceptable alternative
5528055 so when there is no choice of a candidate that avoids supporting intrinsically evil actions especially elective abortion we should vote in such a way as to allow the least harm to innocent human life and dignity
5528056 we would not be acting immorally therefore if we were to vote for a candidate who is not totally acceptable in order to defeat one who poses an even greater threat to human life and dignity
5528057 the apa has completely disregarded credible research that shows abortion increasing the risk of clinical depression suicide drug and alcohol abuse and post traumatic stress disorder
5528058 the reports conclusion also flies in the face of what pregnancy centers see every day
5528059 devastating consequences on women if health professionals follow the apa and withhold potentially lifesaving information about the risks of abortion
5528060 many of the experts weve talked to who reviewed the apa release found that the conclusion just doesnt add up when you examine the evidence
5528061 the heavy pro abortion bias seen in the selection criteria of studies reviewed and the ever shifting standards of evaluation suggest that the apa reached its conclusion first and then made their report fit that predetermined ending
5528062 purposely ignores the high prevalence of women affected by repeat abortions or the equally high number of women in the u s who have felt coerced into their abortions
5528063 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
5528064 young adult women who undergo induced abortion may be at increased risk for subsequent depression
5528065 young women who reported having had an abortion in their twenties were more likely to score above the cut off point for depression
5528066 i think like most women i was just a bit concerned about it when you see childbirth on tv there are always women screaming and i hadnt come into contact with many women who had had babies so i was a bit unsure
5528067 a lot of women do not come into contact with childbirth very often and most have no idea about what it is like on hospital dramas you see women screaming and it portrays a negative image
5528068 we ummed and aahed and decided that we did want to have a baby and im glad we did
5528069 the midwife in salisbury said there was no problem but they were a little more concerned about the potential health risks down here
5528070 i think in salisbury they have got more older mothers down here there are fewer of us so it is a bit more unusual
5528071 i listened to it 25 times before i had alice it gets you to relax and become more calm about giving birth
5528072 i was totally unaware of what was going on around me i could hear my husbands voice but i went totally in on myself i tried to stay relaxed and pay attention to my breathing initially
5528073 i always felt i didnt want to have to use drugs but i would have if i had needed to if you use the cds you are more relaxed and less likely to need drugs because your body is working without them it went so easily i am fairly confident thats what did work
5528074 i used to be a management trainer for 15 years so i love running courses i love that i happen to have had such a positive experience myself it is absolutely wonderful the technique is linked to psychology and other areas i am interested in it is such a great thing
5528075 i have run a couple of courses so far and two of the mums had their babies a few weeks ago the courses are at my home at the moment because i have just started and numbers are small but i am looking at places in exeter
5528076 i think if you are more relaxed your body can do what it needs to do before i gave birth i thought i would need to do something but the more you relax the more your body just gives birth to your baby
5528077 we have clips of women in labour that are so calm and serene you dont realise they are giving birth its about becoming more relaxed so your contractions work and your muscles arent tense and tight
5528078 we talk about hypnosis and what it is about because there is a misapprehension about what it involves i tell them it is a natural normal process
5528079 we talk about how you give birth not in too much detail but just enough so they understand we use physical techniques of movement and massage and the next day we do birthing techniques
5528080 i get them to write their own hypnosis script it is a chance to lie down and go into relaxation and go into ourselves we get partners to come a long and help with the writing we talk about the role of the partner as well so they feel involved a lot of them are keen to know what is going to happen during the birth and are supportive of their partners
5528081 up to 2 4 percent of us population self identifies as mixed race and most of these individuals describe themselves as bi racial
5528082 we cannot underestimate the importance of understanding the social psychological and experiential differences that may increase the likelihood of psychological disorders among this fast growing segment of the population
5528083 its so exciting to be in a building that brings together so many programs
5528084 it brings together 10 of our 14 programs into one building
5528085 its about being wise about the way we use our resources
5528086 the school on jackson street was built for one third the current size of our student body
5528087 it seems like a great place for the start of the fall semester
5528088 you must be the change you wish to see in the world
5528089 did you hear about the day i beat an olympic silver medalist
5528090 the cornerstone of verizon foundations literacy education and technology initiatives
5528091 hes treating it just like he would during a normal game week and the push to saturday
5528092 thats an important part of it guys dont always feel chipper the first part of the week when they get dinged up but they find a way to push to saturday thats how hes approaching the thing thats how were approaching the thing to play in saturdays game
5528093 hopefully we wont need it through the rest of the season but you never know its a long year
5528094 i think he understands the fact that he needs to be out there for 16 games this year
5528095 maybe we learned to live to fight another day and take 2 less yards running up the field theyre trying to rip the quarterbacks head off if they can knock the quarterback out of the game they feel good about their chances
5528096 its not like those guys have a buffer zone around them if they get a legal shot theyre going to take it
5528097 hes trying to make things happen and get the first down
5528098 you have to play like that if you play scared and not play your type of game youre not going to be successful thats who he is
5528099 i would have thrown the ball away as soon as i stepped up in the pocket
5528100 ive been in every situation so theres nothing anymore that anybody can really do to me thats going to surprise me or shock me or frustrate me
5528101 ive always been able to throw the ball hard i think thats what kept me in the league so long its like a guy being able to jump through the roof its just a god given ability
5528102 i dont want to sound cocky but theres not many
5528103 slow ing to a level not seen since the beginning of the decade bc households are now cautious about making major purchases in light of uncertainty around fuel prices and other inflationary pressures
5528104 victoria is different dont you know every boomer and their immigration cousins are moving here en masse and everyone else just got 40 raises
5528105 you are defending more than russias dignity and honor in chechnya you are also here to stop the disintegration of our country
5528106 he is a patriot and will pursue russian interests with just as much determination as i do
5528107 grenades and bullets from machine guns hit the garden and the house

5528118 some people claim that we must vote for mccain because of the future of the scotus but that is not an argument when you think about the republican appointed members of the scotus there now who have been voting against our rights with aplomb their kelo decision for example
5528119 all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the united states which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives
5528120 the powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government are few and defined those which are to remain in the state governments are numerous and indefinite the former will be exercised principally on external objects as war peace negotiation and foreign commerce with which last the power of taxation will for the most part be connected the powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects which in the ordinary course of affairs concern the lives liberties and properties of the people and the internal order improvement and prosperity of the state
5528121 the operations of the federal government will be most extensive and important in times of war and danger those of the state governments in times of peace and security as the former periods will probably bear a small proportion to the latter the state governments will here enjoy another advantage over the federal government the more adequate indeed the federal powers may be rendered to the national defense the less frequent will be those scenes of danger which might favor their ascendancy over the governments of the particular states
5528122 this government is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated powers
5528123 the powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government are few and defined
5528124 our jurisprudence has been driven by a practical understanding that in our increasingly complex society replete with ever changing and more technical problems congress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives
5528125 omg its insertcantwincandidatehere the revolution is upon us next president fur shur 1 one 111eleven 11

5528127 restore the right of seriously ill individuals to obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes when recommended by a licensed physician to aid in the treatment of hiv aids glaucoma muscle spasm cancer or other serious or chronic illnesses for which marijuana has demonstrated utility
5528128 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
5528129 many banks are at the point of worrying what to do next
5528130 a lot of the assumptions have changed from overnight batch processing to enabling electronic transactions
5528131 new players have recognised this and are providing technology that works in real time and puts customers rather than financial products at the centre of transaction processing
5528132 batch processing systems were not meant for 90 percent of what banks do now
5528133 as a result other applications have been cluged on top of current systems to make it look like youre getting a real time account balance
5528134 big r amp d investments by infosys tata sap and oracle mean they now have mature platforms and so they are largely driving this new wave
5528135 our crews are out removing debris from the grates of catch basins in the peninsula cleaning out catch basins of the suburban parts of our city and cleaning ditches and debris from inlets we have also checked out major pump stations
5528136 weve got both of our four inch pumps ready and available in the event that we have a lot of rain we get them ready for the residents and the streets primarily on the north end of the island where there is no storm water infrastructure
5528137 if theres a lot of rain coming we wont do much of anything maybe move some things we dont want getting wet off of ground level
5528138 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5528139 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5528140 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5528141 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5528142 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5528143 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5528144 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5528145 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5528146 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

5528164 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5528165 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5528166 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5528167 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5528168 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5528169 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5528170 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall

5528173 i have never doubted the truth of signs adso they are the only things man has with which to orient himself in the world what i did not understand is the relation among signs i behaved stubbornly pursuing a semblance of order when i should have known well that there is no order in the universe
5528174 but in imagining an erroneous order you still found something

5528186 the compound not only produces dramatic improvements but displays no side effects
5528187 there is one thing we do on earth that we will continue to do in heaven that is to praise and worship god that is why we view life on earth for those who live jesus as choir practise for heaven to say that praise and worship is the most important category of music is an understatement in light of that fact there is no more important activity of the human heart that to praise and worship god

5528191 recorded 8 16 08 at the birds nest thanks as always to
5528192 ive been doing a considerable amount of traveling these past few weeks
5528193 for every mix we post the quality of our craft becomes more intense in order to bring you fresh tracks and the unique ways we present them our inspiration thrives because of you the listener thank you
5528194 its summer again here in d c and this was perfect timing to post the second installment of summer love v 2 nothing feels better this time of year than a sexy soulful house mix i have been stockpiling love theme tracks for the last year to carry on the tradition may your summer bring you peace love and happiness and i truly hope this mix will touch your soul it did mine
5528195 while listening to these tunes i got a little nostalgic for some reason
5528196 for every mix we post the quality of our craft becomes more intense in order to bring you fresh tracks and the unique ways we present them our inspiration thrives because of you the listener thank you
5528197 when compiling this mix i created and deleted four playlists until that one all inspiring forgotten track by tom pooks crept up and got me going with thousands of tracks to choose from and only sixty minutes to work with i always do my work in the late night hours why no cell phone ringing or outside noise distractions just music and decks this mix has a main room feel that climaxes right in the middle and ends with a classic love tune those all night diners sure come in handy enjoy
5528198 im taking a break from the main room sounds amp offering up something for the smaller more intimate lounge spaces
5528199 breaks are a drummers dream and being one i cant get enough of this genre from the first beat by aphasia and sandwiched in the middle by classic breaks producers laylo and bushwacka this mix sets a pace that really doesnt cool down until the final ambient movement by pako and frederik hard slamming drum beats cushioned in with fuzzy bass lines and amazing synth work i really hope you enjoy this mix as much as i did creating it
5528200 im starting off 2008 with a fairly loud one here sleep deprivation due to listening to music will definitely do that to you this one was mixed in the middle of the night amp you can tell the classic opener from
5528201 there is no doubt that i am an 80s child and putting these compositions together sometimes gets all inspiring
5528202 i was introduced to afrobeat in the fall of shortly after the death of fela kuti who pioneered this amazing sound in the late 1960s
5528203 definitely one for the night owls amp the late night set ideas for mixes like this one tend to hit me during post midnight drives the big lush sounds of
5528204 rap music has taken a back seat in my rotation of listening why because rap music has become a circus of cheap casio keyboard production and just down right horrible rappers the phony gangsta mentality along with the block party big booty bling does not represent the hip hop culture rap music is supposed to be pure conscious and backed up by versatile djs who can supply musical samples organic beats and the scratch this mix is all of that enjoy
5528205 i truly miss this kind of music funky beats intelligent samples amp wise words what happened there was definitely a time when hip hop ruled my speakers the downfall for me really began when rappers started paying more attention to the appearance of the product rather than the content of the cuts i still search out choice cuts but it is getting difficult which strikes me as disappointing given rap is the most popular form of music today if youre looking at music sales both downloads amp retail it just goes to show that the best music of any genre remains truly underground
5528206 during the span from 1995 1999 there used to be what they called record stores yeah you got in your car and drove there inside these music stores they had in alphabetical order separated by genre these round thin plastic discs that held information in form of music it came with a case artwork and all the information about what was on the music disc it was tangible and you actually walked out of the music store with something in your hand i have had this idea for back in 95 for quite some time the problem was what tracks to use and how to execute it from the golden era of acid jazz to the evolution of electronic music i truly hope you enjoy this mix oh and thanks for downloading it
5528207 these tracks are part of a very extended set list that hit me on a late night drive back to the house
5528208 in the last several months i have acquired some really great house music in fact it was perfect timing for a summer posting as a test i was able to play this mix at the sheffield court pool for my neighbors the response generated a chill summer vibe for everyone there from the sexy sounds of chuck love to the old school love ballad of terry callier i truly hope your summer brings you peace love and happiness til next time enjoy
5528209 years ago i investigated classical music to show that i was musically rounded but never really embraced it today i find myself listening to classical music everyday and enjoy every aspect of this genre
5528210 interstellar sounds meet dark grooves ive been watching quite a bit of the life in space series if you havent checked that out do yourself a favor the intense bassline of east west connection sums it all up i sincerely hope you enjoy this extended mix cheers
5528211 i always wish i grew up in new york city during the 1970s with the thriving disco scene
5528212 i havent listened to this kind of music in quite some time but this mix helped me rediscover these type of massive sounds back when the boxed crew ruled the clubs its also the kind of sounds that brought me my first shows years ago in california when 808 states in yer face was my highlight track so heres another return to form with some newer tracks that have that same driving feeling to them from the classic opener of narcotik to the huge sound of wavehead with a peak hour bass line big enough to fill any warehouse i sincerely hope you enjoy it cheers
5528213 this new mix has been a lot of fun to compile as it should always be collecting and listening to a lot of new music and digging back through the old to resurrect some forgotten tracks i found myself amongst a pile of songs and a whole evening in front of me to complete this mix for you from my collection to your ears enjoy the sounds
5528214 j bird s back with another mix thats well worth the wait as usual he simply does not disappoint so sit back relax amp let your headphones do the rest you need these sounds
5528215 arlington va a suburb on the virginia side of dc right across from the potomac river filled with stores bars restaurants condos and clubs ive had the pleasure of working in arlington for the past six years and ive decided to move there in april the rest of northern virginia is a great place to get married own an overpriced house and raise a family to me arlington has been a saving grace and a reassurance that there is a place in the dc metro area that young adults can go and listen to live music mingle with each other and enjoy the night life i want to dedicate this one to all the great people i have met throughout the years from ballston to rosslyn there is nothing sweeter than arlington nights
5528216 the similarities in the cover between this new mix amp
5528217 part two is always a scary attempt in any kind of art form in the 80s movie sequels were all the rage in music sequels are becoming quite the follow up in an attempt to keep a producer series alive to da floor ii was done all at one time but i had two cds worth of music i would like to get back to my roots of mixing and bring you some hard 4 4 beats for all you cats out there again i warn you make sure your shoes are comfy when you hit that dance floor ill be up in the booth if you need me enjoy
5528218 the basement tapes are exactly what you think they would be simple sessions done just for kicks i like doing these mixes on the fly it gives me an opportunity to use tracks i wouldnt normally select while at the same time check out some new releases im especially biased amp will definitely dig into some west coast house sounds this ones strictly for fun i sincerely hope you enjoy it cheers
5528219 many times in this genre of electronic music great artists are outshined by what we know as club hits or just a buzz on the street of what was hot at the local club or disco tech
5528220 its been awhile since ive been back to the netherlands the last time i was there some deep downtempo beats served as the continuous soundtrack in my headphones theres something very transcendent about walking the stone sidewalks in amsterdam while listening to the grooves of space hopper or the vocal samples used by neotropic hope you enjoy these afterhour sounds cheers
5528221 these hot summer days are sometimes a lazy time for me a lazy sunday afternoon usually involves some good food refreshing spirits amp of course music the warmth of the sun reminds me of living in my cramped studio apartment in
5528222 ok one band that has affected my life the most in a musical sense is
5528223 i have to be honest this month has been a rough one after a wonderful six years my girl and i have mutually decided to go our separate ways while moving out i thought to post an old classic that i did as a two part series about 8 months ago shred and i kid that this was the mix that brought me out of my shell what can i say make sure your shoes are comfy when you hit that hardwood thanks for the great memories trish
5528224 this one is a result of simple reflections on the sun the sand the surf theres something about the west coast that i find very endearing as well as relaxing amp vibrant all at the same time all you need to do is take a drive down highway 101 amp youll quickly see what i mean from the downtempo groove of juan trip to the upbeat electro of j amp s productions i hope these sounds take you to the pacific shores a place i hold very close to my heart its another overview of another late night hope you enjoy it cheers
5528225 i just want to let everybody know that there is nothing like a great groove once again i dug into my record stock and pulled some quality tracks for all to taste this record should be played with your good foot in mind old wooden dancefloors are nice strobe lights a disco ball some cocktails and oh yeah dont show up too early cause the party doesnt get slammin til about 1 00 am enjoy
5528226 its difficult to try amp cram a setlist for a nightclub into the one hour range nevertheless here is what i would play if im feeling a bit intense from the blue sounds of martinez to the peak hour bass of shafunkers its meant for the 2 am amp beyond crowd with low lights serious heat amp a sound system to die for hope you enjoy it cheers

5528251 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5528252 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

5528255 objections against christianity come from insubordination unwillingness to obey rebellion against all authority
5528256 the misfortune of our age in the political as well as in the religious sphere and in all things is disobedience unwillingness to obey and one deceives oneself and others by wishing to make us imagine that it is doubt no it is insubordination
5528257 the attitude of those who willingly suffer everything for their unquestioned faith and who obediently commit atrocities for it too
5528258 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5528259 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5528260 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5528261 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5528262 youre better than this place youre like a flower that grew out of a pot of dirt
5528263 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5528264 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5528265 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5528266 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5528267 i was excited happy to come meet the cheerleaders all of them and get my hair done
5528268 i think this is an amazing event and an amazing opportunity especially that she loves cheerleading so much and gets be around the beautiful cheerleaders here at the broncos organization
5528269 this is the first time weve ever done anything like this
5528270 just seeing sierras smile on her face pretty much makes me want to do this for every game
5528271 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5528272 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5528273 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5528274 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5528275 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5528276 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5528277 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5528278 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5528279 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5528280 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

5528291 japan consumes 14 barrels of oil a year per capita
5528292 if china used the same amount per capita as parsimonious japan chinese consumption would total more than 18 billion barrels a year an amount that dwarfs our countrys 7 5 billion barrels
5528293 add that to new demand for oil stemming from india the newest members of the european community an increasingly prosperous brazil and so on for those trying to discern the long term future of oil prices this is considerable food for thought
5528294 in contemplating china we need to look past carefully crafted images and deepen our understanding of her national interest failure to do so will be perilous
5528295 lamentablemente al d a de hoy a este momento no ha sido posible obtener una negociaci n en los mismos t rminos con la empresa cemex y tal como establece la ley a las 12 de la noche del d a de hoy vamos hacer un control operacional de las instalaciones de cemex
5528296 ya ustedes van a ver c mo van a bajar dentro de poco a bajar el precio del cemento que es el cemento m s caro del mundo por qu porque est n en manos privadas y le ponen el precio alt simo vamos a bajar los costos del cemento los costos para la construcci n de vivienda y todo eso
5528297 ellos cemex estaban requiriendo m s de 1 200 millones de d lares nuestra idea de esos activos est n muy por debajo de eso y las negociaciones acordadas con lafarge y con holcim establecen para nosotros un piso
5528298 graves deficiencias que en materia ambiental tiene cemex con nuestro pa s y en materia fiscal
5528299 ha venido proces ndose ese caso porque hay una ley que lo regula y ellos tienen que cumplir con esa ley

5528310 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5528311 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5528312 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5528313 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5528314 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5528315 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5528316 the unstable air hit and it blew up on em
5528317 we expect to get quite a few more fires out of this
5528318 we use a value which we call precipitable water to measure the moisture in these storms and were seeing very high values higher than even we see during the winter
5528319 thats because the air mass is very warm and warm air can hold more moisture than cold air
5528320 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5528321 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5528322 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5528323 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5528324 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5528325 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5528326 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5528327 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5528328 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5528329 they jumped on it really fast sometimes conditions just combine to make it difficult to catch
5528330 they are pretty much into mop up mode right now there are a couple of active fires in the structures but i dont think well see any more spread at this time
5528331 the unstable air hit and it blew up on em
5528332 we expect to get quite a few more fires out of this
5528333 we use a value which we call precipitable water to measure the moisture in these storms and were seeing very high values higher than even we see during the winter
5528334 thats because the air mass is very warm and warm air can hold more moisture than cold air
5528335 if i did that every day i wouldnt need to attend any training courses anymore i could learn everything by myself right
5528336 team tibet 08 were tackled by chinese security forces within seconds and immediately and forcibly detained and deported from china
5528337 i was shocked to see he is not supportive of this
5528338 i thought him being an advocate on health and everything i thought this would have been a natural thing for him to support for him to not even give it the opportunity have a broader discussion is very puzzling to me
5528339 this is clearly not a a high priority for the people of san jose we just want through a six month community based budget process setting priorities and making decisions about how we spend time and money and this never came up
5528340 i think we have a lot of serious issues facing san jose right now
5528341 this is something that is going to take away from the real work that needs to be done

5528347 we made up a plan that we were going to tell the cops that nobody kicked him that there were no racial slurs there was no booze and brian got hit first
5528348 when i heard about it i was really surprised i couldnt believe it was them

5528355 no way i cant pitch through this i cant throw
5528356 honestly when they first drafted him i was like who is this guy whyd we get him and now i see the guys a playmaker im glad ive got him on the other side
5528357 that was my mind set before the draft even i wanted to come in and contribute early for a team
5528358 normally you associate a rookie with being lost and kind of playing a little bit slower than all the other guys and you can normally point a rookie out and notice his mistakes and i didnt want to be that guy
5528359 i wanted my teammates and my coaches to be able to count on me knowing that i know my responsibilities and i will come through in the clutch
5528360 i didnt know he had those type of receiving skills i thought we drafted him a little bit more as a returner
5528361 hes a go getter he picked up the offense quick he attacks the football hes got great speed gets in and out of cuts hes fun in the huddle he understands what were doing
5528362 you dont want to stand out for the wrong reasons
5528363 we had him as the best wide receiver in the draft
5528364 we had him no 1 so we felt very fortunate to get him there in the second round
5528365 and you never know until a person gets in how quickly he matures or how he handles the pressure but hes handled it quite well
5528366 people will have the chance to go to the gallery when waiting to go to a show well be able to share audiences
5528367 we really believe our success is tied to the missouri theatre but also that the missouri theatres success is tied to ours
5528368 each particular member group brings audiences that wouldnt come otherwise the member groups are important to the success of the theater we diversify the audience
5528369 people generally think of belly dance in a restaurant like a middle eastern restaurant
5528370 in north africa and the middle east belly dance is on the big stage like at the missouri theatre all belly dancers know its considered a major art form but here there are a lot of misconceptions about that for us to be able to perform at the missouri theatre that helps our art form and elevates it
5528371 they will have the glory of the stage and the curtains and the acoustics will be wonderful for them
5528372 the symphony society their mission is to support classical music in columbia
5528373 so the youth orchestra is a part of the mission of the symphony society
5528374 we consider the theater to be the cultural center of the city arts community
5528375 to be performing at the center of the arts community is a privilege
5528376 were excited about enjoying the beauty of the restoration from the lobby to the auditorium to the backstage facility
5528377 i wish i had found this place 30 years ago
5528378 its a blessing in disguise i wouldnt go back to the old place
5528379 but now weve been here a year and a half and people have found us very well
5528380 im tickled to death that i had to move to make it the theater so beautiful
5528381 before we moved it was run down and falling apart but now its a piece of art
5528382 my whole life man ive been in situations that i had no control over
5528383 this is just another one of those things so im alright with it this is nothing
5528384 our main concern is just to get him healthy right now
5528385 he doesnt need to worry about competing right now he just needs to get back to 100 percent
5528386 when i was in elementary school my parents basically left it up to me whether or not to go to school when i was in second and third grade
5528387 after i went into the group home they held me back in second grade at first but then they decided to put me back in the fourth grade where i was supposed to be for my age so most of the time i was pretty behind and had to catch up the whole time
5528388 going to junior college was really the best thing for me
5528389 i learned so much when i was there and now im like a totally different person
5528390 my first two semesters at pearl river i was taking 18 and 19 hours summer classes night classes everything so ive dealt with all this before
5528391 people always say stuff like i could fill justin smiths shoes and stuff like that
5528392 thats something i take as an honor and i feel like i can live up to that eventually i just need patience even if im only healthy for half this year ive still got a year and a half to do everything i can to meet those expectations

5528396 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
5528397 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5528398 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5528399 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5528400 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5528401 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5528402 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5528403 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5528404 moscow may be expected to punish israel for its intervention
5528405 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5528406 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5528407 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5528408 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5528409 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5528410 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5528411 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5528412 who are open to doing something on the production side
5528413 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5528414 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5528415 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5528416 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5528417 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5528418 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5528419 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5528420 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5528421 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5528422 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5528423 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5528424 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5528425 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5528426 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5528427 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5528428 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5528429 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5528430 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5528431 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5528432 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5528433 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5528434 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5528435 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5528436 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5528437 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5528438 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5528439 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5528440 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5528441 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5528442 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5528443 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5528444 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5528445 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5528446 im clear absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer

5528451 we had our appendices and other pain causing parts removed by dr oconnell
5528452 as a collective we have been so poor in that arena
5528453 and this was a team that was supposed to be built on offense more than anything else weve been offensively challenged
5528454 we still have hopes we still have dreams weve put too much work in to just have it die right now
5528455 you know what its like when you have children and you say get the car home at a certain time or be home before a certain time and they dont theres a certain amount of anger at first but then a lot of its based on disappointment
5528456 to be playing with the top players in the world was so much fun i learned so much from them and watching what they do and how they play
5528457 i only hit four fairways and scrambled around all day
5528458 i was hitting it so far off line that i had some good lies in the pine straw and on the packed down cart paths you name it i was on it but i got up and down from everywhere
5528459 i definitely have a lot of things to work on especially my putting but im looking forward to tomorrow ive played no 2 a lot more advanced to final of this years north amp south amateur and really feel comfortable out there
5528460 i hit the ball okay and putted pretty good i just couldnt get the ball in the hole
5528461 the course played hard out there today considering everything im pleased with 71 it could have been worse
5528462 i couldnt get to sleep it was probably 11 30 or 12 00 then i was up at 6 this morning but if youre playing well its all a lot of fun if youre playing bad its not so much fun
5528463 i went to moms driving range one time and saw all these people hitting golf balls and it looked like fun
5528464 i grabbed a driver and starting hitting my mom liked it and encouraged me to keep playing
5528465 obviously i have had a very good year especially these last two weeks
5528466 it has been more than i could have ever expected
5528467 right now im not sure if ill go to q school as an amateur or not
5528468 i think its the most beautiful performance in the world
5528469 are a priority of our nation so we think our thing is the best

5528471 allergic rhinitis and onset of bronchial hyperresponsiveness a population based study
5528472 even though pneumococcus is very common until recently no one had realized that it could develop this pilus to reach out and touch a human cell
5528473 oral streptococci which are normally in the mouth and throat have the pilus genetic package and we believe pneumococcus picked it up in the back of the throat we decided to look at how the bacterium figures out how to use that package
5528474 when bacteria attack the lung there are two steps they need to do to establish pneumonia
5528475 they need to stick to lung cells and they also need to invade the lung cells our experiments were designed to separately test those two steps and we established that the pili are not used for adhesion but for invasion which was not understood before
5528476 so far only 20 percent or so of the clinically important strains of pneumococci have developed this trick of producing the proteins for making pili
5528477 in creating vaccines we want to use proteins that occur in a wide variety of bacterial strains these pili related proteins are not prime candidates so we can now concentrate on other proteins that we know are expressed almost universally by pneumococci and that we can put into a vaccine
5528478 current vaccines used in the developed world cost over 100 a dose and are limited to protecting against perhaps 10 to 15 types of pneumococci
5528479 but that price is far too high for developing countries and there are 90 types of pneumococci out there

5528481 this finding represents a key extension of other studies on puma because such loss had never been shown before in human cancer
5528482 on the one hand patients receiving traditional chemotherapy can suffer the loss of immune cells and this loss occurs in part because puma induces the death of these cells
5528483 in this case the goal would be to protect patients bone marrow by developing drugs to inhibit puma on the other hand for patients with a lymphoma in which puma was inactivated drugs could be used to reactivate the gene to trigger apoptosis and kill the tumor cells

5528485 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
5528486 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
5528487 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
5528488 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
5528489 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
5528490 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation
5528491 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5528492 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5528493 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things

5528520 were trying to get a second breath and we arent going to give up
5528521 what we need to do is to introduce the american experience into other teams we shouldnt blame who is strong in softball what we should do is improve the level of competition in the weaker teams

5528549 i was shocked to see he is not supportive of this
5528550 i thought him being an advocate on health and everything i thought this would have been a natural thing for him to support for him to not even give it the opportunity have a broader discussion is very puzzling to me
5528551 this is clearly not a a high priority for the people of san jose we just want through a six month community based budget process setting priorities and making decisions about how we spend time and money and this never came up

5528601 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed

5528608 the folk alliance is pleased to be associated with one of the most respected songwriting contests on the planet newsong and the legendary mountain stage radio show i know that this contest can change the career path for its winners and we are proud to be a part of that process
5528609 the partnering of the mountain stage newsong contest with the folk alliance is a natural
5528610 the result will be an even greater impact on the two institutions missions of promoting the song and the songwriter
5528611 newsong made everyone feel like we were there for a purpose and that we were being celebrated for what we do everyone was treated so well and told that newsong would always be a resource for us even one year later they are still in touch its much more than a songwriting contest
5528612 thats just one chapter in emmas story to this gold medal and shes moved on since then
5528613 shes got great times ahead with her new fiance craig and i really dont think emma would want that lukes death to be the focus of her big win yesterday
5528614 im always careful not to give emma too much advice she could probably tell me a thing or two shes the ultimate professional
5528615 so i kept it simple and just said keep it as normal as possible because thats the one thing in the olympic games you dont treat it like a different race
5528616 she knew how to win shes won every race this year so she just had to keep it the same
5528617 it aint that bad here it will get better eventually

5528627 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5528628 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5528655 saya tentu tidak boleh buka semuanya karena itu terkait rahasia transaksi perbankan tapi memang diduga terjadi penyalahgunaan wewenang dan penyimpangan
5528656 jadi uang itu sempat disekolahkan dulu nah bunganya itulah yang diduga dinikmati bersama atau dibagi bagi untung cuma bunganya bukan induknya itulah yang dianggap kesalahan fatal dan ada unsur rekayasa
5528657 sebab pinjaman diberikan kepada pemerintah bukan rekening atas nama bendahara
5528658 itulah yang sedang diselidiki hasil penyidikannya kami belum tahu bisa saja ada data yang mungkin dimusnahkan atau tidak kita tidak tahu
5528659 kalau proses kreditnya sendiri sudah tidak ada masalah dan sudah lunas
5528660 untuk kasus di kutai timur dilihat dari sisi penghimpunan dana apakah rekening yang dibuka bendahara pengelola pinjaman dahrin adji dahrin pranoto yang telah dijadikan tersangka oleh kejagung red sesuai ketentuan yang berlaku di internal perbankan atau tidak
5528661 kalau dilihat dari sisi bpd saja sebenarnya bpd tidak ada yang dirugikan sebab kewajiban pemerintah kabupaten sudah selesai semua bunga juga sudah dibayar
5528662 itu sebabnya pihak kejaksaan ingin mencari tahu prosedur pembukaan rekening di bpd termasuk aktivitas transaksi rekening itu juga dipelajari
5528663 dalam hal pembukaan rekening nasabah tak mungkin harus izin direksi sebab sudah ada kuasa yang diberikan direksi kepada pimpinan cabang sehingga segala kebijakan ada di tangan pemimpin cabang
5528664 bpd sebagai bank milik daerah punya komitmen juga untuk membangun daerah tidak hanya kutai timur tapi malinau kutai barat kutai kartanegara pun pinjam ke bpd itu artinya bpd ambil peluang sebagai agen pembangunan dan mendorong pembangunan secara fisik semua pinjaman itu prosedurnya sama
5528665 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fund raiser with one of jack abramoffs closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program

5528667 the irony that barack obama and his allies would attack john mccain for rooting out corruption in washington and fighting special interests like jack abramoff with these baseless assertions speaks to the real level of commitment that barack obama has for making any change in washington

5528680 i dont think the u s needs to be even handed in the middle east it needs to stand with and behind our only ally israel
5528681 as the election approaches it will be a time of choosing americas role is not to be an honest broker in the middle east it begins with standing for the security and interests of israel
5528682 what kind of message does that send to arabs persians and muslims in the region the majority of whom would like to see peace and political social and economic development reign supreme over lingering war occupation and enmity
5528683 when ahmadinejad says he wants to wipe israel off the map he means it hed do it to the u s and europe if he could
5528684 we need to look at the world as it is theres no way we can sit idly by and allow iran to build a bomb
5528685 we find iranians making inroads in south america with bolivia and venezuela iranians have no business in the western hemisphere
5528686 this is a perilous time with the menacing pronouncements of ahmadinejad god forbid the next holocaust will not require camps but one missile and one bomb and 17 minutes of flight americans democrats and republicans are coming together to place more pressure on iran until it abandons nuclear weapons

5528691 indy greens started the presidential petition drive on january 1 2008 in independence virginia
5528692 eight months 15 days later the cake is baked the deed is done were happy hillbillies since january 1st indy greens collected 70 000 petition signatures seven successful petition drives to put five candidates on the ballot for u s house and 2 statewide petition drives and now michael bloomberg on ballot for president we made a promise to mr bloomberg and now we have kept that promise
5528693 if it is an issue that a candidate is put forth we assume that the internal communications have happened but if we were to receive a letter from mayor bloomberg that he doesnt want his name on the ballot we would have to look into the matter to see why the nominee for a party doesnt want to be that nominee
5528694 it is a free country and if chooses to not have his name on the ballot he has every right to do so
5528695 yes bloomberg must consent to this and it will be up to the board of elections
5528696 but we made a promise and we wanted to keep it and we have
5528697 he hasnt made any decisions and hasnt had a chance to speak with party chairman carey campbell yet but this is a call for post partisanship that mayor bloomberg hopes the major parties will hear

5528704 parents get angry when theyre spanking and its not working
5528705 if a child gets spanked so often they just dont care anymore and will misbehave anyway
5528706 people want to change behavior immediately and they think spanking is the way to go
5528707 down the line though these children do far worse that relationship of trust is broken
5528708 spanking can be administered in a loving manner to help children understand whats right and wrong
5528709 but its not just something that ought to be done with little thought

5528715 its a quarantine we can bring over insects that would attack a certain weed from asia or other places
5528716 we ship insects here they cant get out of this building unless theyre autoclaved which kills everything and we can do the testing to see what other plants they might eat what other insects they might bother
5528717 we would love to have that insect here within a couple of months it comes from kazhakstan we need to do the processing to get our permits to get it over here once we have it here it will take a few years of testing to make sure it doesnt attack any of the valued plants we have in the area

5528741 is that it were going to hang him on that
5528742 isnt it a little late for you to be out
5528743 we made up a plan that we were going to tell the cops that nobody kicked him that there were no racial slurs there was no booze and brian got hit first

5528752 that visit really paved the way for a fruitful and friendly exchange between the two cities and we are delighted to be able to accept this invitation from the city of huzhou mr chapple said
5528753 well also be travelling to our sister city taishan in the guangdong province to meet the new mayor and to affirm our sister city relationship
5528754 were really interested to see what opportunities there may be for our local and regional businesses to export into both huzhou and taishan mr chapple said
5528755 our hope is that we will meet the australian consul general in china and other trade officials to explore what business opportunities may exist for example exporting wine from our region to china
5528756 on the future friendly exchange plan between our two cities
5528757 aside from being in a very beautiful and scenic part of the world huzhou is also a very progressive and dynamic city with a robust and growing economy and we are sure we can learn a great deal from them as well as from our sister city taishan during this visit cr hull said

5528759 i felt i couldnt really ask others to go through this process unless i was prepared to do it myself and im proud to say ive now lost almost five kilos in less than two weeks
5528760 aside from raising much needed funds for relay for life we hope this challenge can make a real difference to a few lives cr allgood said
5528761 algae is generally made up of one third oil but this varies between species mr sherger said
5528762 the oil content remains constant per kilogram of algae but its the growth rate how many kilograms per square metre that we want to know
5528763 algae has a huge growth rate its 20 times more productive than any other terrestrial plant
5528764 a lot of local algae are adapted to salty water because a lot of our creeks are saline mr sherger said
5528765 farmers could use that ground to grow their own fuel and it wont impact on their farming mr sherger said
5528766 john will do a lot of the day to day work in running the trials as there needs to be someone there for a short time on a daily basis to see how the algaes going mr sherger said
5528767 we have to fix the system or it will be a long time before the economy recovers

5528881 commodore bainimarama had the opportunity through his attendance at the forum to explain this decision in person to pacific leaders
5528882 fiji will still be despite his absence a major feature of leaders discussions in niue
5528883 my assessment is that leaders feel that the events in fiji are really casting a stain on the pacific
5528884 the leaders want to be seen and have the forum be seen to continue to be leading international opinion and action on the issue
5528885 the pacific forum needs to understand that we in fiji will decide what is in our national interest in the short and the long term
5528886 most if not all pacific island leaders are against fiji being further victimised by australia and new zealand even if they may not say so openly in niue

5529031 the students requested the poster to show all people deserve respect and tolerance and should not be harassed for any reason
5529032 the poster ensures student safety through a message of tolerance and respect
5529033 the posters promote a sexual lifestyle that is against judeo christian beliefs it should not even be acknowledged to youth much less promoted i am here to censor their attempts to promote that lifestyle on my children we do not want them to try and change our children

5529037 harper needs all the help he can get in quebec a place where mulroney continues to command a network of political leaders and operatives and where he remains much beloved
5529038 should mulroney decide to intervene in the next election campaign against harper the prime ministers efforts to win a majority may be thwarted
5529039 in the end mr harper will be the worse for it this was one of the rare occasions where mr harper panicked to his detriment
5529040 wise enough to be tough on his opponents when it is to his advantage but he must display a more amiable side to his party the press and the nation being optimistic and visionary rather than gruff and a loner is the better path to becoming a majority prime minister

5529052 well now that you do know this will this change your vote on his election
5529053 i would doubt the veracity of such information at this moment it seems like a last minute ploy
5529054 i can assure you with absolute certainty that was not my implication and certainly not anything i ever said
5529055 i am furious for my remarks to be interpreted in a way as to mean something i never said

5529060 the governor believes that if texas fails families texas will fall far short of its potential to have safe communities the best schools in and economic opportunity for all texans
5529061 he also believes that the traditional family with a loving mother and a loving father provides the ideal environment for children
5529062 as governor he also is guided by deeply held beliefs
5529063 every one who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery
5529064 and he saith unto them whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another committeth adultery against her and if a woman shall put away her husband and be married to another she committeth adultery
5529065 the spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons such teachings come through hypocritical liars whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron they forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods which god created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth for everything god created is good and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving because it is consecrated by the word of god and prayer

5529067 i dont know if there is a cause and effect connection but we have seen some recent episodes of courthouse violence in this country certainly nothing new but we seem to have run through a spate of courthouse violence recently thats been on the news and i wonder whether there may be some connection between the perception in some quarters on some occasions where judges are making political decisions yet are unaccountable to the public that it builds up and builds up and builds up to the point where some people engage in engage in violence
5529068 stripped of ethical rationalizations and philosophical pretensions a crime is anything that a group in power chooses to prohibit

5529082 we found there were a number of signature gatherers who would sit together and use each others signatures over and over and over
5529083 when someone cheats and breaks the law to get themselves on the ballot i think we as citizens have a duty to step up to the plate and call these people to account
5529084 the opposition knows that and the only way theyll win is to keep it off the ballot
5529085 it is clear here that the illegal and deceptive signature gathering tactics brought into arizona by ward connerly have had a far reaching impact on the ballot this year this year weve seen the ballot process generally has been influenced by mr connerlys tactics and by the influence of his georgia based firm national ballot access
5529086 there might have been a few people who slipped through the cracks
5529087 if were in trouble then so are a lot of other initiatives
5529088 i think that puts giffords back into a little more safe territory shes in really good shape there it comes down to name recognition and yes well tim bee was senate president but i think her name is going to go a lot further

5529104 to be frank a great logo and a stirring motto mean little in these digital days when people can set up a blog or chat site and ask
5529105 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5529106 a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated
5529107 level of objectivity has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5529108 we are concerned that your news division is following msnbcs lead in abandoning nonpartisan coverage of the presidential race
5529109 with all due respect to the campaign leadership they are viewing our coverage through a political prism

5529114 unwittingly associated with communist front groups in 1930s and early 1940s
5529115 criticized communists and has advocated socialism he has been inconsistent in indicating at one time an awareness of the communist menace and the necessity for security measures against them and at other times a lack of such awareness he has implied both criticism and praise to the fbi at different times
5529116 on march 21 1962 a confidential informant advised that on march 15 1962 while he was talking in the presence of an associate with a third person in the latters office in washington d c the third person confidentially advised that one of his friends has reported to him that during his undergraduate days at harvard university he had attended a communist party cell meeting presided over by arthur m schlesinger jr as chairman
5529117 our investigation did not develop any information indicating connection with any community party cell at any time
5529118 cited as a member of the red front american student union
5529119 j edgar hoover was a dreadful influence on america and that he should be fired

5529129 ron why are you making your voice sound like your mother while we are in the middle of this
5529130 ronnie its mum this is more important than your sunday morning shag come to the floo or im coming in there
5529131 shit ron how does she know about our sunday morning shag
5529132 i dont know but right now is not the time to find out

5529136 but he was born before we got serious we both get to be with this one from the start are you ready to help a new life face the big bad world
5529137 with us helping her through the big bad world will never get in our rosies way
5529138 its much too early to leave a three month old alone with her godfathers
5529139 that wasnt the song when you told your brother to take his wife away for the weekend or did you conveniently forget that
5529140 ron its the babys bath time why dont you run the water while i get her cleaned up
5529141 clean her before the bath oh my god what are they feeding that child
5529142 well get her again when she is out of nappies by then most of her teeth will be in and she will be able to flush away the toxic waste
5529143 he is our responsibility now he will be our son we will do exactly what he needs us to do and we will love him until he doesnt hurt anymore then we will love him some more
5529144 yeah it helps to have kids near your own age to talk to daniel is adjusting really well to life in the wizarding world he may not have as much of a shock as i did when i found out i was special
5529145 so ten years with me did you ever think you would make it
5529146 after the oddity of our first year it was either make it or kill each other in embarrassment
5529147 gotcha you didnt really think we would do that did you

5529149 i just thought he was too amazing to not share
5529150 armed men travelling in at least three vans and carrying heavy duty weapons fired on some 20 people who were leaving the towns dance hall
5529151 now i am not inspiring or inciting riots im dreaming singing to the tune of white christmas im dreaming of riots in denver remember 1968
5529152 riots in denver at the democrat convention would see to it we dont elect democrats and thats the best damn thing could happen for this country as far as anything i can think
5529153 if i believe the country will suffer with either hillary obama or mccain i would just as soon the democrats take the hit rather than a republican causing the debacle
5529154 i mean if people say whats your exit strategery the dream end of this is that this keeps up to the convention and that we have a replay of chicago 1968 with burning cars protests fires literal riots and all of that thats the objective here
5529155 naturally a product evolves over time but in many cases there is an immense amount of value in getting a product out to market even though its not your final vision
5529156 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
5529157 oh haaary you are the sweetest boy i have ever met
5529158 you never abandoned me even when i broke up with your best mate
5529159 hee troll bait you could call me t b oh wait then people would think i had tuberculosis better stick with hermione
5529160 she disapparated about 5 minutes ago i told her she could stay or floo but she wanted to brew some hangover potion and didnt trust her stomach to floo i dont think ive ever seen her as drunk as she was last night
5529161 i think she felt a bit lonely last night she was the only one to come alone
5529162 i was thinking that maybe we could set her up with someone you know go on a double date
5529163 you know that really isnt a bad idea did you have someone in mind
5529164 i swear harry he could give lockhart lessons in being charming
5529165 good for being barefoot and pregnant giving up my career to raise your children
5529166 i assumed that i would stay home with the children
5529167 you have nothing to be sorry for im just tired of people expecting me to pop out babies because im molly weasleys daughter
5529168 im good with children because everyone assumes im good with children and dumps them in my lap i m not sure i ever want any of my own even if you were to be one of those housebands that are in those feminist magazines i would still have to take a year off quidditch if i got pregnant a year in quidditch means the difference between being a starter and being a reserve two years thats the difference between being a starter and being on a farm team
5529169 we probably should have talked about this before but i guess i thought teddy and all the weasleys would be enough family that maybe you didnt want to be a father do you think you would be willing to give up fatherhood for me
5529170 you really would have given up your biggest dream to stay with me
5529171 stop being such a fucking martyr and leave while one of us has sense ill have all my things gone by the evening
5529172 but he didnt and there seem to be no ill effects other than my mouth feels like the sahara desert and i have to piss like you wouldnt believe
5529173 is this revenge for what i did to your sister
5529174 sorry mate i used too much asphodel and not enough catmint
5529175 besides ginny said she broke up with you not the other way around
5529176 she may have broken up with me but i was a horrid boyfriend
5529177 oh for goodness sake stop feeling sorry for yourself everything in the world is not your fault
5529178 thats easy for you to say you dont know the whole story
5529179 i know that there is nothing you want more than to have a family to be a parent the way that your parents intended to be i know that ginny thought that if she were going to have children at all it would have been with you therefore unless you feel like telling the rest of the story the three of us are going to get you a new kettle i am tired of heating water in a saucepan
5529180 that is the worst idea i think you have ever had worse than when you were convinced you were possessed by voldemort and a monster really
5529181 thats all you have to say i tell you all that and you care about my stomach monsters
5529182 what would you like me to say harry that you were such a horrid boyfriend that you deserve to be miserable for the rest of your life you dont
5529183 why were you willing to spend the rest of your life your life with someone you werent in love with
5529184 still do she is brilliant and pretty and way out of my league
5529185 that it will go away sooner or later everyone leaves
5529186 the pac is opposed to the disbandment of the scorpions corruption is a crime and we have to use whatever means at our disposal to fight corruption
5529187 i am also struggling but it is a passion that drives me to make a difference in the lives of others i endeavour to give hope and dignity back to the homeless people
5529188 there are times when i have no food in my own house i feel like giving up but an urge within me keeps saying i must go on
5529189 he told me later he had never been hugged in his entire life and had been humbled and cried because of my gesture
5529190 she has taught us the basic values of sharing with others the little we have although she does not have plenty she makes sacrifices in order to make a difference in the lives of other people
5529191 he seemed fine but when they stopped at a cafe in lindsay road sidwell he bought a pack of razor blades
5529192 he came out screaming that five dogs had jumped over the fence and that the dogs had attacked him
5529193 there were about 10 to 15 traffic officials there at the time and he tried to take some of their firearms away from them
5529194 he was wild eyed and disorientated and was going berserk as he tried to get a firearm
5529195 all the time he kept mumbling about licence discs and taxis
5529196 i can confirm that there was an incident as to what transpired i cannot comment until the outcome of an investigation has been released
5529197 after he was stabilised he was given a choice of whether to stay on as a private paying patient or go to a public hospital
5529198 he was not prepared to pay and was taken to livingstone hospital
5529199 the prescription issue is premature bitous lawyers still have to file a plea in that regard
5529200 i was disappointed and angry at the same time when saladino took the lead
5529201 i cant express it that moment everything just shut down
5529202 i came to the games hoping to get into the finals and i went into the finals hoping to get any medal
5529203 its something for me to cherish for the rest of my life
5529204 i felt there was something left for me on my final jump i told myself i was going for 8 40m his personal best is 8 39m i think i would have got it but i was red flagged
5529205 communities affected by the violence have engaged among themselves and although hostility still continues in a few communities the vast majority of those displaced have been reintegrated
5529206 it is now time to listen to victims of violence it is not time for us to accuse each other it is time to restore peace
5529207 it will take time for wounds to heal there is no room for arrogance
5529208 another matter which is of deep concern is justice one cant be seen to be doing for a what were not doing for b you cant be seen to be doing for foreign nationals what youre not prepared to do for south africans
5529209 joe bloggs thought you might be interested in our offer
5529210 put something in a class i want you to start typing today because we have had the problem defined for over two weeks solve the problem refactor only if you have to
5529211 yawn another spoon fed press release for me to reword
5529212 i disagree with the assertion that developers are largely happy with their salaries
5529213 companies work hard to keep their cash and typically only invest in the risky business of software when theres a lot more money to be made
5529214 why put up with rubbish wages when you can earn more in another profession
5529215 1 the reason most projects fail is down to the individual developers
5529216 a real large chunk of em would do a bloody good job of it too
5529217 its probably about right in terms of payment vs effort
5529218 as for the roi argument i have to say there is a major management problem with the companies that behave the way youve described
5529219 companies that undertake software projects with no thought to profits and then overpay developers to the point that theyre fat and happy are either doomed or up to something that we dont understand
5529220 the fundamental problem ive seen in most projects is management
5529221 if only they didnt have to write a quick fix for the release on friday and then once thats done theres another quick fix and another
5529222 is there mediocrity at work in software development sure you bet same goes for management sales and just about any other job field you want to look at
5529223 how many people die each year due to mistakes made by physicians pharmicists
5529224 complaining about it is about as effective as complaining about gravity
5529225 it is obvious you havent worked in the industry for very long
5529226 the incompetent programmers move on to become managers of some sort
5529227 if you would run iq tests of everyone in a company and then compare them to salary i can guarantee that the programmers will turn out to be underpaid rather than overpaid
5529228 programmers deserve blame though and they do so because they will accept doing dumb changes that lead to bad applications
5529229 if i click to the left of this text the entire article and all text within it is marked in my firefox 2
5529230 how do you think of role played by smart folks like you in mentoring
5529231 people who are eager to learn to design solutions in a better way

5529236 introducing agile after a little disruption can make them awesome by removing impediments

5529252 it came in through all three doors that i have
5529253 i dread to think what it would be like to have tyrell and another rookie back there with what we have ahead of us
5529254 it means so much to us to have sharper in our secondary with all the experience he has plus the experience he has in this scheme
5529255 its put a little more on him because he has to communicate more than he had to when madieu was here or when he was with another safety hes handled it well and hopefully it wont take away from his game because were asking him to do a little bit more from a verbal communication standpoint but i think he can handle it
5529256 he showed this past weekend that he can play his game and still help us with the young safety
5529257 he made a heck of a play on an interception and he did a great job covering a punt
5529258 he broke through two guys who were really holding him he just refused to be blocked
5529259 a lot of that comes from the fact that many of the alt net crowd have made a living over the years cleaning up the aftermath of a mort attack i know i have i know firsthand that jeremy jeffrey scott and several others have also
5529260 i think today ill accuse agilists of having an arrogance problem
5529261 i honestly dont understand how kids find the energy and complete random behaviors that they do
5529262 i flew in two days ago to prepare the boat
5529263 not much to do on a dock like this but add extra lines and make sure the boat can rise and fall with the tide
5529264 this isnt a hurricane if the media wasnt down here hyping this up this would be a non event
5529265 they should continue to stay calm and be smart and make sure they exercise common sense

5529279 our client is anxious to address this matter unfortunately at this time we must decline your offer for an interview we await our opportunity to present our case and for the facts to be heard by the court our client denies the allegations and would like to bring closure to this most unfortunate matter
5529280 its been an ongoing course of conduct at the school not the sexual assault but just hazing type of incidents on the bus where the varsity players may have tormented the junior varsity players a little bit and we feel over time that this has progressed into the incident that happened on april 17
5529281 fifty eight players trying out for lockports varsity team is the largest i can ever remember
5529282 its a little bit more difficult to get kids through the repetitions because theres more of them to work with by the same token weve also seen a good influx of talent so more kids also translates into more talent and an opportunity for us to find more quality players
5529283 im pretty well conditioned as are a bunch of our players
5529284 i feel fine weve done the weight room and passing league over the summer mainly we condition ourselves to what our position is i thought we looked real good as a team out there
5529285 the first three days of practice are non contact with players wearing just helmets
5529286 its basically some conditioning and some installation of our offense and defense and getting guys to go through repetitions so that once theyre able to start hitting theyve got a better mental focus and grasp of the offensive and defensive schemes
5529287 somewhat surprising to us that ea agreed to change its offer from hostile to friendly
5529288 i was going through the scheme all week with the coaches
5529289 they finally put me on the punt return team and i just tried to take full advantage of the opportunity i was given
5529290 the more room you have to work with the better off you are i saw angelo the whole time i was just hoping he wasnt going to miss his block
5529291 its hard to deal with now because its not like were game planning what were going to do on third downs but i still think that makes an impact on the outcome of these preseason games
5529292 its always tough when you get the ball at the 1 yard line initially we ran the ball the guys up front pounded it and kenny watson had some nice runs we strung together good plays and capped it with a touchdown
5529293 its not like he had to catch up in a hurry its not like he has to learn chinese or anything hes fine
5529294 failing to bargain realistically and remove unattainable items from the table
5529295 you cant have a plan that just says were holding secret meetings and our question is just what the hell does that mean
5529296 two scholars and two employees at the school were attacked by another scholar who was in possession of weaponry described as being similar to japanese samurai swords
5529297 one scholar suffered fatal injuries and was declared dead at the scene the other scholar suffered a serious wound to the head the two staff members suffered slightly less serious wounds
5529298 the gardeners were treated and released but the other scholar is still in hospital
5529299 he was very calm when we arrested him in the staffroom
5529300 when the suspects truck was stopped the driver ran away but was caught by the police officers
5529301 we chose the sight operations because at that time there was a backlog of over 700 patients needing surgery the eye clinics were unable to cope with the number so we decided the lions would fund cataract operations
5529302 we helped the local hostel by buying much needed bed linen we sponsor a luncheon for the elderly and we also have helped with equipment for the hospital
5529303 maar totdat er echt vrede is moeten we rekening houden met een wisselvallige en kritieke humanitaire situatie
5529304 the competition is now tougher than when it started everyone who is in it wants to prove to mkhize that they are the one who should get the record deal

5529307 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5529308 a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated
5529309 level of objectivity has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5529310 we are concerned that your news division is following msnbcs lead in abandoning nonpartisan coverage of the presidential race
5529311 i flew in two days ago to prepare the boat
5529312 not much to do on a dock like this but add extra lines and make sure the boat can rise and fall with the tide

5529315 the best way to comfort and support liu xiang is to continue to watch and support the other olympic competitions
5529316 a modest miracle for the yellow skinned chinese people and the asian people
5529317 liu xiang persisted but he honestly had no way to go on because the injury was right at the point of impact on his foot
5529318 liu xiang our message to you is this we will forever be with you
5529319 since the earthquake the media have seemed to discover the value of the individual and the value of life in communicating with the public
5529320 the public also developed a shared consciousness and a sympathetic response that is different from a simple sense of nationalism
5529321 top chinese athletes do not use ice and do not tape sports nutrition is nowhere on certain levels china is on equal footing with the west and we see that in the gold medal battle but they are not going to reach their full potential until they master sports medicine
5529322 in the u s athletes can train on their own schedules but in china because you are part of the system you train very hard the benefit is that you make rapid progress but your athletic career is shorter in the west an athlete might keep competing into the 30s and 40s but not in china
5529323 liu xiang took us to heaven and now he has taken us to hell
5529324 liu dongming taught himself to play guitar while busking on the beijing subways and has slowly grown to be one of the most feted folk singers in china

5529327 communities affected by the violence have engaged among themselves and although hostility still continues in a few communities the vast majority of those displaced have been reintegrated
5529328 it is now time to listen to victims of violence it is not time for us to accuse each other it is time to restore peace
5529329 it will take time for wounds to heal there is no room for arrogance

5529335 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities
5529336 however it appears that mood is correlated with cognitive performance more so than medication use

5529340 a half century ago a woman who had a child outside of marriage was highly stigmatized
5529341 we need to focus a lot more than we have before on the education opportunities for immigrant children this makes very clear that theyre a big part of our future
5529342 i wondered why that was true and found that those second generation hispanic mothers did have higher education attainment than the third generation
5529343 it means that 25 years from now therell be many elderly people who are childless and who may not have anybody to care for them
5529344 arena features smaller maps that play out in shorter periods of time the round ends once one team has no players left in the arena or when the central capture point has unlocked and been captured rounds tend to be very fast and highly competitive with an emphasis on your teams class makeup and your plan to counter the opposing teams class choices arena mode is great for smaller matches of three vs three players while still comfortably supporting huge knockdown twelve on twelve brawls

5529352 within the last three months the governor the provincial council and directors general have traveled to north babil a feat that was inconceivable a year ago
5529353 we still have work to do in the areas of security water flow clean water and agricultural initiatives

5529364 i thought him being an advocate on health and everything i thought this would have been a natural thing for him to support for him to not even give it the opportunity have a broader discussion is very puzzling to me
5529365 this is clearly not a a high priority for the people of san jose we just want through a six month community based budget process setting priorities and making decisions about how we spend time and money and this never came up
5529366 i think we have a lot of serious issues facing san jose right now

5529472 the big picture is that there are several dimensions in which games have effects
5529473 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could

5529479 saya melihat seorang tentera yahudi memegang saudara saya saliha al halabi yang hamil sembilan bulan dia meletakkan senapangnya di leher saliha lalu memuntahkan peluru sehingga saliha terbunuh tentera tersebut mengambil sebilah pisau lalu membelah perutnya sehingga terburai kemudian mengeluarkan anak saliha yang telah mati dengan pisau nazinya yang mengerikan itu

5529481 saya melihat seorang tentera yahudi memegang saudara saya saliha al halabi yang hamil sembilan bulan dia meletakkan senapangnya di leher saliha lalu memuntahkan peluru sehingga saliha terbunuh tentera tersebut mengambil sebilah pisau lalu membelah perutnya sehingga terburai kemudian mengeluarkan anak saliha yang telah mati dengan pisau nazinya yang mengerikan itu
5529482 pengganas yahudi telah mengarahkan semua ahli keluargaku berdiri mengadap ke dinding mereka kemudiannya menembak semua ahli keluargaku satu persatu aku terselamat kerana aku sempat berlindung di kalangan ahli keluargaku yang dewasa mereka terus menembak sehinggakan sebutir peluru telah mengenai qadriya adik perempuanku yang berumur 4 tahun kemudian seorang demi seorang gugur termasuklah ayauku ibuku datuk dan nenekku pak cik dan mak cik saudaraku serta anak anak mereka
5529483 keadaan yang ada sungguh mengerikan saya juga melihat orang orang muda lelaki dan perempuan yang memegang senapang dan bom tangan tangan tangan mereka masih berlumuran dengan darah saya melihat seorang wanita yahudi yang kelihatan sebagai seorang penjenayah yang sangat kejam dia memperlihatkan darah darah yang menitis dari kedua dua tangannya seraya mengangkatnya dengan bangga seolah olah dia sedang memegang dua piala kejuaraan
5529484 tragedi ini tidak hanya dibenarkan malahan tidak akan wujud negara israel ini tanpa kemenangan di deir yassin
5529485 mancari harta yang halal adalah suatu kefardhuan selepas sembahyang fardhu
5529486 jika seseorang sentiasa meminta minta sedekah maka dia akan menemui allah dalam keadaan mukanya tidak mempunyai daging

5529488 dan berpegang teguhlah kamu sekalian kepada tali allah agama islam dan janganlah kamu bercerai berai dan kenanglah nikmat allah kepada kamu ketika kamu bermusuh musuhan semasa jahiliyah dahulu lalu allah menyatukan di antara hati kamu sehingga kamu bersatu padu dengan nikmat islam maka menjadilah kamu dengan nikmat allah itu orang orang islam yang bersaudara
5529489 s tiene dispraxia y esto es algo que l nunca ha escondido afortunadamente el grado del mal mental es muy leve y en el peor de los casos se manifiesta en la incapacidad para amarrar sus agujetas y en una mala escritura
5529490 l claramente lo manifiesta de una forma muy suave lo cual es un buen signo y un gran homenaje a sus habilidades porque actuar lo convierte en un modelo para otras personas con esta condici n
5529491 you know aint nuttin change but my limp cant stop till i see my name on a blimp

5529498 i didnt come to try and break records in that respect but to walk away with two medals so far im absolutely ecstatic eh
5529499 i left the country convinced that russias invasion of georgia may be the one of the most significant event to occur in europe since the end of communism the claims of georgian atrocities that provided the pretext for russias invasion are rapidly being disproved by international observers and the continuing presence of russian forces in the country has severe implications for the broader region the war that began in georgia is no longer about that country alone it has become a question of whether and how the west will stand up for the rights of free people throughout the region the outcome there will determine whether we realize the grand ambition of a europe that is whole free and at peace
5529500 russia must make good on president medvedevs commitment to immediately withdraw russian troops to their positions before the current fighting began we also need a truly independent and international peacekeeping force in georgias conflict regions and we must help the people of georgia to rebuild their country and preserve its democratic institutions
5529501 when congress reconvenes i intend to work with the administration to seek congressional approval for 1 billion in emergency assistance for georgia with a substantial down payment on that aid to be included in the congress next supplemental spending bill
5529502 i have long sought to help russia realize its extraordinary potential as a force for progress in the international community and have supported legislative efforts intended to forge a more constructive relationship with the kremlin but russias actions in georgia will have consequences
5529503 i congratulate the people of pakistan on the peaceful resolution of their political crisis and i applaud the decision of president musharraf to give up his office for the good of his nation
5529504 the two major parties in the governing coalition the ppp and the pml n worked together to bring about a change in government through constitutional and nonviolent means
5529505 i urge pakistans leaders to focus now on the pressing challenges of the future and resist the temptation to settle scores of the past president musharraf made the right choice in stepping down i hope his resignation marks the end of the political turmoil that has immobilized the pakistani government in recent months

5529524 i got a cactus in the bathroom but weve got nothing to say to each other
5529525 hay una falta de voluntad muy fuerte por parte de las autoridades mexicanas para solucionar este tema
5529526 los periodistas y sus familiares prefieren no denunciar porque saben que no va a pasar nada
5529527 hay una creciente cultura de la impunidad que empeora cada d a
5529528 you have to remember that the people who are saying it will take ten or fifteen years are the same people twenty years ago who said it would take ten or fifteen years
5529529 their effort made up for the five catches we dropped and it augurs well for the future of canadian cricket
5529530 i am an opening batsman but i did what my captain asked me to and am pleased that i was able to play a role in my teams win
5529531 i worked very hard to get to this point because my dream was to play for canada when i got here
5529532 it was quite a performance from the young man in his first game
5529533 its a pity that our experienced players in the middle order did not come through
5529534 fgs coarse track failed time out waiting for data valid
5529535 its got to be kaine and doubling down with warner at the convention just means theyre making a big play for virginia which makes sense my moneys on kaine
5529536 you dont need a secret decoder ring to read this one kids
5529537 i think itll take the stress off if we know that when it rains the basements not going to flood and we dont have to go down there and bucket it out or worry that the boiler will get taken over by the water coming in things like that
5529538 im so impressed with this family theyre such solid people they havent asked for anything theyre just so gracious and grateful that makes us want to work that much harder and give them that much more
5529539 were just giving them tools this week to continue doing what they do taking care of others taking care of their community and giving back
5529540 i think mostly if theres anything they can do for the community with the program the children thats whats most important
5529541 you have some vignettes that are very dramatic and emotional and maybe that is geared toward the female gender
5529542 but i think everyone appreciates incredible moments male and female
5529543 favre came up to me later in the game and said i was going to let you have the ball but i think i am going to keep it
5529544 i said ok thats cool i will keep the next one
5529545 as soon as i get in the locker room i get a tap on my shoulder from him and he says you deserve this here you go
5529546 i think its probably more important that he keeps the ball
5529547 hes got tremendous talent i hope he has a lot more of those
5529548 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game
5529549 and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
5529550 he is real calm and collected in the huddle even though he is new with the offense
5529551 every single time he comes in its like he has been with this offense for his whole career we are more calm and collected we just feel really good about it

5529560 the world produces few leaders that combine high level executive experience long term vision and a global perspective with the earthy humane sensitivities gloria feldt is such a leader equally effective in the board room clinic press conference or at the speakers rostrum and she is an energized witty charismatic leader
5529561 today has been a truly remarkable and memorable day it was wonderful to spend time getting to know gloria for she is a very smart inspiring and hopeful woman i can honestly say that she gave one of the best speeches i have heard while at hamilton
5529562 i admire the way you interact with every person who has a question or comment for you treating them with warmth and respect you field questions and engage in dialogue with poise wisdom and humor
5529563 thank you for your inspiring presentation this was not a speech it was a conversation a story telling a wake up call and an inspiration

5529565 mba students ask tough questions and challenge a leaders assumptions gloria was a most welcome guest in my class as she consistently energized the students with her clear and realistic sense of what it takes to successfully lead a complex organization
5529566 in all the best sense she has embodied many of margaret sangers qualities gloria is a great visionary but at the same time she is very focused on understanding the increments in which you have to realize a vision
5529567 gloria is a practical visionary and they dont come along very often
5529568 as a man i have benefited from glorias leadership she epitomizes leadership being right there up front

5529573 the rationalism and moralism which is the driving force behind social study whether we admit it or not is the faith that institutions can be improved and strengthened and that people are good enough to live a happier life
5529574 to find the practical formulas for this never ending reconstruction of society is the supreme task of social science the world catastrophe ww ii places tremendous difficulties in our way and may shake our confidence to the depths yet we have today in social science a greater trust in the improvability of man and society than we have ever had since the enlightenment
5529575 strengthening is expected tonight and tuesday and fay is forecast to be at or near hurricane strength winds of 119 kilometers or 74 miles per hour as it approaches the southwestern coast of florida
5529576 tornadoes are likely in some areas tonight monday and tomorrow and maybe even into the next few days
5529577 even though this storm doesnt look like its very dangerous and people will say its just a tropical storm or its just a category one hurricane our experience with florida tells us that if were not careful we will lose people
5529578 we have amazing waves today something not seen very often on this beaches its a perfect day
5529579 its clear in the movie ill always call star wars and call the first movie but which has been officially renamed a new hope and which younger fans know as episode iv that uncle owen holds a grudge against lukes father and this is without his knowing that anakin skywalker has become darth vader
5529580 was punished for following his training exactly how he was taught
5529581 not only did he publicly criticize what mills did but he stood on the church steps and re enacted the whole thing to show how bad it was ive never seen a chief do that
5529582 while the armada crisis absorbed englands attention roanokes settlers struggled with a life or death crisis too
5529583 paul greens play the lost colony suggests that the colonists sampson butler gramme dare we know the names of all the lost people soon realized no ship would come in time to save them
5529584 possibly they floated their goods and building materials 60 miles south to manteos village on present day hatteras island certainly the one word they left behind indicates thats what happened

5529587 have a strong tradition that the roanoke colonists amalgamated with them
5529588 several of their ancestors were white people and could talk in a book
5529589 my grandfather born in 1830 told me that in his indian village he lived in one of several very old two story houses of hand hewn timbers and boards on the mainland across from roanoke his blond blue eyed mother malockie paine we believe was descended from colonist henry paine
5529590 the economy here in austin is kind of like flying in a jet airplane where youre flying high and suddenly you hit a downdraft and it drops 1 000 feet this unanticipated downdraft in business activity started in january 2008 and has greatly accelerated in the last 90 days
5529591 its going to get tough over the next six to nine months because some of those homebuilders are going to have to leave the market involuntarily
5529592 you are starting to see quite a few small mom and pop retailers going out of business
5529593 texas and austin are poised to prosper from the growth that is coming from the next upswing in the economy
5529594 we had a baby weighing only 580 grams and she survived
5529595 when we unwrapped the baby to see her she realized it was moving i began screaming and ran with it toward the doctors
5529596 i thought i wasnt hearing it right when they said she was still alive
5529597 never heard of such a case it was like a medical miracle
5529598 trust me ive been a victim and know what you are suffering

5529606 tv week reports court shows are among the most popular on the tube
5529607 might have the star power to distinguish himself from the welter of court shows
5529608 jesse is a bigger than life personality and there is always an advantage of having a brand name like his attached to a show
5529609 that personality could especially work well in the court genre where he could break through in a crowded field needless to say it would be hard to confuse him with the other judges

5529617 how many children to you have or plan to have
5529618 a lot but less than you can count on two hands
5529619 bring the war on terror home to those who would terrorise the free world
5529620 a huge arsenal of weapons including shotguns machine guns sniper rifles explosives rocket propelled grenades and more
5529621 while teenagers can buy graphic computer games allowing them to fantasize about killing iraqis and afghans this game war on terror has been lambasted in the press and banned by major retailers and games fairs
5529622 zavvi are the latest in a long line of big businesses desperate to hide this from their customers if wed called the game kill the terrorists we wouldnt have any problems but its politically sensitive and thats what this is about youve got to ask yourself why do zavvi feel the need to protect their customers from a board game that is critical of war and violence when they have no problem pushing computer games that celebrate and reward brutal and aggressive behaviour
5529623 im not happy right now i was never good at languages
5529624 it definitely wasnt as bad as i thought it would be
5529625 ive been performing since i was three i have training in every aspect so for me to be compared with someone who sounds like they just began singing thats not really fair
5529626 i didnt come here to learn i just think i know more its that simple
5529627 shayna doesnt see the big picture she doesnt invest in the exercises or try to make new friends it just doesnt seem that she is here for the right reasons
5529628 the headlines look ugly but the drought is what has caused that and the impact on wholesale prices has been largely unwound
5529629 i think 75 percent plus one vote is a great victory the rest is irrelevant the cme was able to get a super majority as they presented a strong proposition
5529630 cme wants this so badly because the futures market is one of the few monopolies left in the world
5529631 and its a monopoly because they have their own clearing operation
5529632 i think a lot of people are going to try to get an irs ruling that it is long term capital gains
5529633 aqu ya hay la palabra del primer mandatario tanto de colombia de rep blica dominicana como de puerto rico lo que hace que en esta ocasi n haya mayor fuerza institucional detr s del proyecto
5529634 my heart really breaks when i think that all this killing took place without any judicial process and by our own forces
5529635 after the war even the slightest suggestion that your family had leftist sympathies would leave you open to hostility and hatred
5529636 there is proof that it was reported to the very top
5529637 us soldiers took pictures and reported back to their superiors
5529638 on two occasions my unit was told to collect suspected leftists from the police and we conducted group executions
5529639 but you have to understand the situation at the time our forces were in a very disadvantaged situation and cornered
5529640 mom dont you wish your girlfriend was a freak like me
5529641 hopefully we got him out soon enough before it could completely lock up
5529642 cindy you will be noticeably pregnant for this part very noticeably
5529643 there will certainly be no further escalation of our bans until we hear back from there then well know whether they believe that we can get back to the table and finalise some negotiations
5529644 it is possible but unlikely for the simple reason that swimming commands our attention only once every four years while tiger and lebron enjoy weekly even daily coverage during their respective seasons
5529645 the olympic games effect how sports marketing builds strong brands
5529646 swimming is really not the topic of our typical sports conversations once the olympics end so sustained visibility will be a challenge for phelps
5529647 companies that become sports sponsors whether of athletes teams or events want to associate with greatness
5529648 we love good stories and michael phelps is one of the best so he is a natural attraction for companies
5529649 the level of funding that was put into place by coag the council of australian governments is vastly inferior to what was needed
5529650 so one of the things that were calling for is an increased level of funding to go into the initiative going forward but also to look at the systemic policy issues that need to be addressed if we are going to go forward with this problem
5529651 it is not putting too fine a point on it to say young peoples lives are on the line in this issue
5529652 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5529653 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5529654 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5529655 performance improvements were achieved by each of our divisions despite the impact of long periods of dry weather adverse exchange rates and poor returns to sheep and beef farmers
5529656 the ccaa is a sketch an outline a supporting framework for the resolution of corporate insolvencies in the public interest
5529657 parliament wisely avoided attempting to anticipate the myriad of business deals that could evolve from the fertile and creative minds of negotiators restructuring their financial affairs
5529658 it left the shape and details of those deals to be worked out within the framework of the comprehensive and flexible concepts of a compromise and arrangement i see no reason why a release in favour of a third party negotiated as part of a package between a debtor and creditor and reasonably relating to the proposed restructuring cannot fall within that framework
5529659 while the notion of releases in favour of third parties including leading canadian financial institutions that extend to claims of fraud is distasteful there is no legal impediment to the inclusion of a release for claims based in fraud in a plan of compromise or arrangement
5529660 an interpretation of the ccaa that recognizes its broader socio economic purposes and objects is apt in this case
5529661 here the debtor corporations being restructured represent the issuers of more than 32 billion in non bank sponsored abcp notes
5529662 he was required to consider and balance the interests of all noteholders not just the interests of those who launched the appeal whose notes represent only about 3 per cent of that total that is what he did
5529663 im putting the bat on the ball it just seems to be going to people
5529664 its only a game a day in the olympics but a game a day in the olympics probably feels like four or five
5529665 theyre a tough team but theyre coming off a lot of losses and itll be tough for them to get up and hopefully we can continue our dominance
5529666 weve got a real roll on here right now our bats are soaring
5529667 a little bit but the playoff round is the second tournament the most important one
5529668 well the next election has not been scheduled until october 2009 and who knows mr dion may want to wait even longer than that
5529669 we have established a strong record of achievement over the past 2 1 2 years
5529670 have to make a judgment in the next little while
5529671 the first thing dion did the first words out of his mouth after becoming liberal leader in 2006 were to threaten to force an election
5529672 about three weeks ago i finally told mr dion that it was time to fish or cut bait so instead of making a decision he actually went fishing
5529673 its a major victory for the new government but there is still a lot of uncertainty going forward
5529674 currently we are planning on playing the game certainly the circumstances can change
5529675 we will continue to monitor the storm and its progress we will continue to consult with government agencies as well as the angels and the american league
5529676 if the storm continues its current track and the road conditions are safe we will play the game
5529677 well monitor the weather throughout the day if theres going to be a call to postpone it likely would be made in the afternoon
5529678 we want to see how frequent this occurs what steps might be taken do all judges approach this in the same way those kinds of things
5529679 obviously what needs to prevail here is the safety of the child
5529680 the only defence that child had was the law which is designed to defend her and the court who has an obligation to uphold that law
5529681 i suggest to you that the judge in this instance failed that child miserably but also failed in her duty as a judicial officer
5529682 i think somebody should be looking into what happened in this particular case
5529683 but whats more important is changing the rules going forward so you always have a criminal background check so that you always have proper representation for the child
5529684 people are frustrated and apprehensive and are saying what can we do to make it right
5529685 it is up to us the four nations people we need to work together to come up with a long term solutions against the gangs the drugs and the violence but our community has to take charge
5529686 these communities have to recognize that they have a problem with some of these young people that are out there with their gang ties and this lifestyle with drugs and the violence and they can go home to grandma and grandma will accept them and love them unconditionally kamins said
5529687 well the grandmas and other community leaders have to stop and say wait a minute
5529688 the hardened criminals and the entrenched gang members are committing these crimes and they are committing violence and they are hurting the community terribly
5529689 we have to balance that on the other hand with the fact that we have a lot of people involved in gangs who may be rehabilitated
5529690 they are our people they are our children they are our community members our relatives and it may look simple and easy from someone on the outside but to us it isnt that simple
5529691 i am here to tell you today as chief of samson cree nation we are going to reclaim our youth and foster security within our community these young people are our future
5529692 costs for labor materials and supplies and other operating expenses continue to rise
5529693 a reduction in use per customer as a result of conservation more efficient appliances more energy efficient building construction and other factors that negatively affect the companys revenues
5529694 increased customer usage the benefit of rate increases and reduced operating expenses
5529695 youre parked in a handicapped spot thanks for making me walk

5529697 japan consumes 14 barrels of oil a year per capita
5529698 in contemplating china we need to look past carefully crafted images and deepen our understanding of her national interest failure to do so will be perilous

5529700 in the end i control the pet it doesnt just run around attacking stuff
5529701 call me crazy but isnt it possible just possible that obamas lead is being inhibited by the fact that he is you know black
5529702 isnt it a little late for you to be out
5529703 we made up a plan that we were going to tell the cops that nobody kicked him that there were no racial slurs there was no booze and brian got hit first
5529704 when i heard about it i was really surprised i couldnt believe it was them
5529705 failing to bargain realistically and remove unattainable items from the table
5529706 you cant have a plan that just says were holding secret meetings and our question is just what the hell does that mean
5529707 there is no clear and obvious movement forward in the negotiating process by august 25
5529708 has not up to this point been viewed as something the parties feel would facilitate an agreement
5529709 the force and energy of this book could power a train
5529710 this thing took off for me in the basement and didnt stop
5529711 at one point i had to burn the second half so i didnt distract myself from my own dumb deadlines
5529712 isnt the point of a blurb to kindle interest in the book and creative commons attribution noncommercial no derivative works 2
5529713 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5529714 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into
5529715 immediately made those appointments and immediately called around for someone to start teaching me how to live macrobiotically
5529716 the dark gods march in step and i shall deliver them this world for their pleasure

5529721 or do you think he might want to try it
5529722 it certainly looks like a j probably wont be here
5529723 i mean just put the numbers together and you can figure that one out real easy
5529724 i dont really care about the free market and money and things like that
5529725 i havent made up my mind i havent talked to my family i havent talked to anyone about it i dont want to be distracted with anything right now
5529726 and im finally winning some ball games and helping this team out for the first time in three years thats just the way i look at it
5529727 my flesh began to singe as if i were a scrap of meat newly thrown onto the barbeque and then i could hear the bubbling of my skin as the flames kissed it
5529728 i didnt start this with the idea of how should other people interpret it
5529729 there were different times where i was close to coming back to mls
5529730 but d c that isnt home thats a four or five hour plane ride florida i might as well stay in europe
5529731 we do know she was at bagram for a long time it was a long time according to my client she was there for years and she was held in american custody her treatment was horrendous
5529732 was the only woman on our list of disappeared people just the fact that this was a pakistani woman suggests that this is siddiqui its not proof but it raises the possibility
5529733 as the department of justice has said this individual was not in u s custody before she was detained on july 17 2008
5529734 to say that she had been taken into custody only on july 21 2008 is a blatant lie as transparently ugly as any falsehood can be
5529735 the insinuation that she had been hiding herself since 2003 is a travesty of truth an affront to peoples common sense
5529736 put up or shut up that is what i say
5529737 we are talking about a woman who is brilliant who is fanatical and a potential killer and who was clearly fantasizing about landmarks in new york city and elsewhere
5529738 when only one nuclear bomb could destroy a city like minneapolis we dont need 6 000
5529739 senator mccain its time to get serious about reducing the nuclear threat
5529740 it uses the word bomb in an airport so its not real appropriate
5529741 its probably a little unsettling to people to see that in an airport environment particularly post 9 11
5529742 i just took a look and i can see how this would be offensive scary to some the concept of our city in the crosshairs of a nuclear bomb and the strong anti mccain message can we remove it
5529743 its just trying to draw attention to an issue thats an important one and we need to deal with it
5529744 and now northwest airlines is trying to play political censor and i dont think thats their role
5529745 we received several complaints from customers and employees on the content of this ad and erred on the side of avoiding objectionable content
5529746 the airport is a place where people of all political persuasions come for business and pleasure and we wanted to avoid any issues related to what was perceived as a political message
5529747 we would agree that nuclear weapons are scary and thats why we need to pay attention to them
5529748 son if you really want something in this life you have to work for it now quiet theyre about to announce the lottery numbers
5529749 you tried your best and you failed miserably the lesson is never try
5529750 everything always changes the best plan lasts until the first arrow leaves the bow
5529751 yes it is incorrect and so is the report on the l a times web site now those reports could be incorrect only in the most technical sense from everything i have it sounds like the deal may have been agreed to in principle and is down to paperwork but as of this moment it isnt done
5529752 show me the money pro fund raisers play key capitol role
5529753 now faith is the assurance of things hoped for the conviction of things not seen
5529754 they are measures that we will oppose in principle mr ciobo said in sky news today
5529755 from our perspective this government is clearly pursuing some wrong priorities
5529756 so we have taken a decision to oppose measures that we frankly dont believe are in the national interest
5529757 as a result of labors proposed reform we will actually see up to a million people moving from the private system back onto our already under resourced public hospital queues he said
5529758 that is going to compound problems and make them worse
5529759 we certainly wont be doing anything to jeopardise the governments financial position
5529760 but what is clear is that labor is taking some expensive decisions that are not wise decisions and those need to be taken in the context of what is best for australia

5529781 one side want to break monopoly and get the freedom and other side want to monopoly in the world
5529782 i dont have data or intelligence to tell me one thing or another but i would think they would be more apt to go for somebody who would file a lawsuit with the world court or something rather than respond with troops hastert said of kerry
5529783 let me say this in the simplest possible terms when john kerry is president of the united states we will find al queda where they are and crush them before they can do damage to the american people edwards said
5529784 thats a little lofty but everyone should aspire to be that good and hopefully by the end of the year we can be a top 10 team
5529785 weve got six seniors and each one of them has played in games against sacred heart and assumption and highlands and notre dame theyve lived through the wars and im counting on them to show everyone how to win
5529786 theyre coming together well and i know we can play with almost anybody
5529787 well the nature of those inaccuracies i think is relatively innocuous the first thing on that 40 page document that the obama camp points out is that the author got their wedding date wrong the year of their wedding wrong ok well thats not a good thing but it doesnt go to the ideology of obama
5529788 well the nature of those inaccuracies i think is relatively innocuous
5529789 the first thing on that 40 page document that the obama camp points out is that the author got their wedding date wrong the year of their wedding wrong ok well thats not a good thing but it doesnt go to the ideology of obama

5529793 for three years we have been saying that war is coming and the team has been working hard to deliver on this promise
5529794 in just a few weeks we are going to throw open our doors and invite more players into the game than ever before they will have a chance to delve into the open beta and see for themselves that war has arrived and it is glorious
5529795 you murdered my mother and tried to murder my niece you caused this family nothing but pain and devastation
5529796 is content to rely on the failed policies of president bush
5529797 is taking action to support american workers and american companies
5529798 it wasnt a vote to go that day it was a vote to go through a process
5529799 authorization for the present to go through a process to give the president leverage at the united nations and to get inspectors back into iraq
5529800 1 reliance by the united states on further diplomatic or other peaceful means alone either a will not adequately protect the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq or b is not likely to lead to enforcement of all relevant united nations security council resolutions regarding iraq and 2 acting pursuant to this resolution is consistent with the united states and other countries continuing to take the necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations including those nations organizations or persons who planned authorized committed or aided the terrorists attacks that occurred on september 11 2001
5529801 the congress of the united states supports the efforts by the president to a strictly enforce through the united nations security council all relevant security council resolutions applicable to iraq and encourages him in those efforts and b obtain prompt and decisive action by the security council to ensure that iraq abandons its strategy of delay evasion and noncompliance and promptly and strictly complies with all relevant security council resolutions
5529802 one could even credibly argue with the compelling conditions for action laid out in the resolution that president bush was required to go to war if saddam hussein did not comply
5529803 the vote for authorization is interpreted by a lot of people as a vote to go to war
5529804 it wasnt a vote to go that day it was a vote to go through the process of going to the u n building the allies and then making a judgment of whether we had to go i believe there was a better judgment to make and i said so all along
5529805 george bush may be able to fly a fighter jet but john kerry is very bendy
5529806 i can hold this position for a long time without breaking a sweat as i carry the burden of john edwards so shall i be able to carry the difficult chore of cleaning up president bushs mess in iraq
5529807 i am both disciplined flexible and a master of the manchurian art of contortion

5529830 buyers and sellers on ebay set the price you dont
5529831 if you make it easy for people to buy something they will want to buy more from you and you have to have related merchandise in stock
5529832 so for example if youre selling collectibles you should also carry the display racks books and other accessories those particular collectors will want to have
5529833 a lot of new sellers spend too much time studying the site and thats a mistake as you can easily get hung up on paralysis by analysis
5529834 if you do it methodically and slowly you can list your first item in an hour or so and be up and running
5529835 a lot of people get set in a comfort zone especially if they have an initial rush of success
5529836 if you get to the point that you really feel comfortable you know what youre doing on ebay i guarantee you theres a brick flying at the side of your head at 80 miles an hour that youre not seeing because youre not looking in that direction
5529837 it has such a strong hold on the market and such a huge following you cant beat it
5529838 a hardworking woman now thats rare to find these days

5529841 what is this woman doing here by herself and if shes married why isnt her husband here with her
5529842 i never told her i was looking to settle down
5529843 dont fall for the first woman who talks to you
5529844 we all know crossed arms in front are not exactly a great sign any other
5529845 also what do you do if youre out with your buddies and you approach a woman and she tells you she likes one of them
5529846 im still somewhat concerned over some of the things ive read regarding pua as a lifestyle what it does to young mens view of women

5529855 what the children who have been victims of violence and abuse will make of all of this in the future we cannot know
5529856 but they will surely wonder why a feminist of such fame as greer has come to the defence of those who destroyed their innocence and damaged their sense of self
5529857 we are not in the mood for failed leftist excuses for the rising levels of homicide femicide and suicide
5529858 dr greers panoply of protest slogans deployed as social theory was dismissed long ago by the research and policy community as incapable of explaining the present day levels of huge disparities in life expectancy morbidity and mortality rates and other socio economic indicators
5529859 while the burden of history is acknowledged in much of this work the everyday suffering in communities at risk is caused by a multiplicity of factors all more complicated than dr greer would have us understand
5529860 i think its quite presumptuous to say that you know what is happening in the minds of aboriginal men
5529861 all im saying is that unless we deal with the pathology that underlies it we wont get anywhere
5529862 we wont actually stop the violence we may even cause it to escalate

5529873 las empresas han pagado un 30 de las utilidades entre el 1994 y 2007 y han pagado unos us 16 000 millones en impuestos alguien puede decir que estas son cifras excelentes por otra parte las empresas han tenido utilidades muy grandes y han hecho un tremenda mente buen negocio en estos a os en mi opini n en este momento no deber a haber un cambio en el r gimen tributario lo que si planteo es que a nivel del chile desde su miner a y su conocimiento minero se genere mas bienestar para los chilenos en el mbito tributario no creo que sea el momento para innovar
5529874 tenemos cada vez m s dificultades para obtener informaci n de codelco y eso no puede ser tiene que haber un cambio cultural en codelco en estos d as en que todo chile quiere m s transparencia a la luz p blica las cosas se hacen mejor se aclaran las sospechas se reducen y codelco tiene que ser parte de eso nosotros cochilco que somos los representantes del due o ante esa empresa tenemos la obligaci n legal de fiscalizarla de evaluar sus proyectos en el ltimo tiempo estamos teniendo problemas concretos para hacer nuestra pega la empresa simplemente no acepta nos dificulta la obtenci n de informaci n relevante y eso es una situaci n que no vamos a tolerar
5529875 es clave que en este proyecto que la junta de accionistas que va a cumplir el ro de representante del due o tenga atribuciones para que en la medida que alg n funcionario o alto ejecutivo de codelco no entregue informaci n completa y oportuna pueda ser sancionado en este momento cochilco no tiene esa capacidad de sanci n y la ley no la incorpora pero creo que ser a muy importante incorporarlo

5529903 it is very pleasing and slightly surreal to be able to announce record half year results when the financial markets are in turmoil and our rating by the stock market is so low

5529905 effectively the strategy has done what we expected it to
5529906 hiscox has reported a strong h1 despite weak investment returns
5529907 i think its a complete joke where the sector is rated at the moment

5529916 and with the russian czech and slovak specimens you see the material is unbeatable
5529917 you have 16 000 athletes in the village and it is very likely that some boys will like some girls and that in turn will lead to sex
5529918 and if there are free condoms going around people will feel like using them
5529919 people are going out more and more the judokas who are already done the swimmers

5529925 what she found in town on the day of or the day before or the day after his funeral was that the credit card didnt work anymore
5529926 the fact that weve never been recognized and then cindy has to put such a fine point on it by saying something thats not true
