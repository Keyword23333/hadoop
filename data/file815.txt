8150027 i thought we player really well the shots were 32 15 for us weve just got to get a little more polished around the net guys were nervous and jumpy
8150028 it was the first game in junior hockey for a lot of the kids
8150029 we controlled most of the game and with only nine shots i just had to play it simple and make sure there were no rebounds
8150030 i thought i did pretty good there are some things i think i can work on this was only the first game there were a lot of new players out there
8150031 steady and simple there are things he has to work on but i think overall handled himself real well
8150032 we only had 45 players at camp i think it is a more fair approach
8150033 a player can have a bad session and not worry that he wont get a chance to redeem himself
8150034 somebody needs to step up and grab the starting job hopefully well find out over the next four games

8150040 all the political leaders especially tony blair and gordan sic brown
8150041 i used to see him at the mosque and he doesnt have extreme views
8150042 ive seen plainclothes police hanging around in cars for a few weeks now
8150043 my son is an innocent boy and we are a well respected family here
8150044 he hasnt incited anyone to kill mr brown he hasnt plotted with terrorists we havent even got a tv here or the internet
8150045 were going to do an upscale steakhouse with a piano bar
8150046 they told me this place was cursed and they said save your money dont open a restaurant here
8150047 when i think back now i see that it was too good to be true
8150048 the owner was a great guy unfortunately he was beset with so many problems we feel bad that he didnt make it
8150049 in france people would sit around sharing their ideas and thoughts serious and not serious its more than just dining i want people to think and to learn to appreciate their differences
8150050 all the steaks are going to be prime cuts but were going to try to keep it as reasonable as possible
8150051 people are always telling me i should go to other places but this is a great little town
8150052 air traffic controllers could see and communicate with all aircraft
8150053 in the month leading up to her leaving she was involved
8150054 theres a fundamental shift in the way decisions are made im not going to speculate if that was a direction she did not want to be under
8150055 the transition team is seeing this as an opportunity to re envision what characteristics the school leader would have
8150056 its a great thing for all the schools it makes some of the reform stuff real for people
8150057 just that has a significant effect heres the different way that things are happening
8150058 while leadership is important it is by no means the end game of the change were looking for were looking for outcomes
8150059 i think he was misunderstood by a lot of people
8150060 at least take responsibility for what you did i dont think you should be able to take somebodys life and act like it was nothing
8150061 he would come sometimes and visit me four days out of the week
8150062 we would sit and talk mostly he went to the library
8150063 this is good news for patients who in the past might have been forced to undergo a more expensive and invasive procedure to determine if they suffered from blockages in the arteries leading to their hearts
8150064 i believe it is a useful test for the right patient at the right time but i dont believe every person over the age of 50 should have this test as some suggest
8150065 at the end of the day i think each individual physician has to make that determination of appropriateness

8150077 i have moved away from paramilitaries yes i am an ex terrorist but there are plenty of other ex prisoners out there also
8150078 why can they not leave me alone i have done my time and i have let go of my hatred its been eight years since knights release from jail under the good friday agreement and i have bothered nobody
8150079 i am just trying to get on with my life
8150080 there has been a hate campaign against me since i came out of prison i have kept my head down and tried not to get into it but i am fed up with it
8150081 yes i did what i did i cant change the past but whats the difference between me and gerry kelly gerry adams and martin mcguinness they are all ex paramilitaries and are now in government but you never hear billy leonard complaining about them
8150082 they expect the unionist and loyalist people to accept them in the government but us loyalists cant do anything
8150083 i am not in the apprentice boys but if i was is it such a big deal when martin mcguinness and others are in the government of this country
8150084 they portray themselves as men of peace but they dont seem to want to let go of the past are they are the ones with the problem
8150085 i have changed i have grown up a lot since back then i have moved away from paramilitaries
8150086 in prison i had a lot of time to reflect and i try to look at other peoples perspectives now
8150087 i could have come out of prison and got involved in paramilitaries again or gone down the road of criminality but i chose not to so why cant they get off my back
8150088 its not fair of these politicians to talk about fighting for the victims families because all this cant be helping the victims families
8150089 those people must want to forget about the likes of me it must be hard enough for all the victims families living without their loved ones without being reminded on a regular basis every time dallat or leonard bring up my name
8150090 yes i was a terrorist but so was martin mcguinness and now hes running the country its totally hypocritical they have double standards
8150091 i was a man of war but now i want peace to work but a fair peace some nationalist and republican politicians come across as not wanting a fair peace they just want to score points against the british government and loyalists
8150092 that wont build confidence in the unionist community they expect us to accept ex terrorists like gerry kelly and martin mcguinness in government but yet they keep picking on me and other loyalists
8150093 if peace is going to work is has to be fair to both sides we have all made mistakes in the past so lets try to move on now
8150094 we cant sweep the past below the carpet and we shouldnt but pouring millions of pounds into enquiries that wont achieve a lot wont help
8150095 i have decided to speak out to say get off my back but will those politicians listen
8150096 i have genuinely moved on in my thinking i want to get on with my life and i want people to forget about me but its as if im the only person who did anything wrong
8150097 when i went into prison the media picked on me because i showed defiance coming out of court
8150098 since i went into prison 95 of what has been written about me has been lies and i know why
8150099 they made me out to be a monster and wrote what ever they wanted about me and basically because i am a convicted murderer they can write what they want about me and get away with it
8150100 that is why john dallat and billy leonard feel that they can say what they want about me and the media will report it
8150101 john dallat and billy leonard accused me of being an mi5 informer with absolutely no proof
8150102 i can sit here and categorically state that isnt true
8150103 but they just seem to be able to say what they want to say someone is an informer when they are part of a paramilitary organisation is the lowest of the low because the big thing in paramilitaries is trust
8150104 look what happened to some of the informers on the other side like scappatici and dennis donaldson i could quite easily have been shot over that maybe thats what they would like

8150115 whod want private sentiments to someone they loved revealed lawyers sent a warning she hopes it will work
8150116 im still in touch with the jacksons and this is something that will happen due to some problems theyve had to postpone that and concentrate on other things
8150117 once they iron out all their current problems theyll move forward with that its still on the cards
8150118 it was a real pity to lose so much time and so any chance of overall victory i took the sprint and became leader on the road but then i went a bit too far back in the peloton and they attacked at the front i tried to chase but it was impossible and so i lost a lot of time

8150121 we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt we must make our election between economy and liberty or profusion and servitude if we run into such debt as that we must be taxed in our meat and in our drink in our necessaries and our comforts in our labors and our amusements for our calling and our creeds we will have no time to think no means of calling our miss managers to account but be glad to obtain subsistence by hiring ourselves to rivet their chains on the necks of our fellow sufferers and this is the tendency of all human governments a departure from principle in one instance becomes a precedent for another till the bulk of society is reduced to be mere automatons of misery and the fore horse of this frightful team is public debt taxation follows that and in its train wretchedness and oppression
8150122 i am opposed to a solution under the unitary system only because a future government can take away the powers devolved under a unitary constitution this is exactly what happened for the safe guards the minorities had in the soulbury constitution within 9 years of its adoption
8150123 there are other materials that give better performance or have higher energy densities
8150124 i think things are actually progressing better than maybe some of us might have thought in terms of the relationship between the two of them
8150125 they havent known each other very well or very long and sen obama ran against his wife and theres still some bruised feelings but i think the president and sen obama are trying very hard to reach across that divide
8150126 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank an economy out of the doldrums and trying to help middle class families and it wouldnt make much sense for me to want to edit his remarks to prevent him from making a strong case about why we need fundamental economic change in this country
8150127 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8150128 there was some tension there it was a long battle and thats what politics is about
8150129 its a little bit like relationships you fight and you reconcile
8150130 you could argue that no one is ready to be president
8150131 sen clinton has pledged her whole support to my campaign as has president clinton
8150132 i think you will see during the course of this week that the democrat party is energized and determined to take the white house back
8150133 hell not only transform the nation hes going to transform the world

8150135 we cant afford four more years of a foreign policy that has shredded our alliances and sacrifices our moral standing around the world
8150136 ladies and gentlemen thats the bad news but there is good news america we dont have to have four more years of george w bush and john mccain
8150137 the united states had its day but in the end couldnt put its own self interest ahead of its crazy irrationality over race
8150138 there are legitimate reasons that some older white voters might reserve judgment on mr obama without being closet racists
8150139 p roponents of the racial explanation for the closeness of the campaign point to a new york times cbs poll last month in which 19 percent of white voters said that most of the people they know wouldn t vote for a black candidate
8150140 would working class whites be such a problem for a black democratic nominee if he were a centrist like doug wilder or colin powell
8150141 if it had been colin powell race wouldnt have been a problem

8150148 we have responded to the european commissions enquiries by providing them with documentary evidence of this unauthorised illegal ticket tout scam being perpetrated on consumers by these screenscraper websites it is remarkable but unsurprising that a number of european government agencies and the european commission has sought to blame ryanair for blocking the illegal activities of these screenscrapers instead of tackling the real consumer scandal which is the hidden 200 percent or 300 percent mark ups being levied and over charged on innocent consumers by these illegal screenscraper ticket tout websites
8150149 todays report is another indication of the tremendous success of health care reform survey after survey continues to demonstrate that more massachusetts residents are enrolling in health insurance plans giving them access to primary and preventative care and avoiding more costly treatment down the road while each survey has its own unique methods and challenges we are particularly encouraged to see that the u s census bureau has found that massachusetts now has the lowest rate of uninsured residents in the nation working together with our partners in health reform we will continue towards our goal of ensuring that all massachusetts residents have quality affordable health insurance

8150163 youve got to turn up the heat a little practice a little harder be a little more intense
8150164 turn it loose stop thinking so much and just play football
8150165 you see some young men that really didnt even practice on the varsity last year sophomore tailback kyle lumpkin never took a varsity practice snap sophomore jared tew at fullback never really took one junior brenton byrd at corner had never played there sophomore kevin fogler at wide receiver sophomore tyler schonsheck at guard so those are guys that are maybe new faces to our program at least in terms of being varsity players and yet what has to transform is that it carries forth to saturdays when its time to play
8150166 you just dont have as many guys that have been involved in a college football game i do think that the guys that we have have been exposed in terms of terminology and checks and things that occur during your system but this sport its a people driven sport and ultimately its players that play
8150167 i dont think it does us i think probably logistically were putting a bit on whether its the clock keeper or the back judge to realize at what point in the game i understand we want to speed the game up a little bit which thats quite within reason is there another way in a year or two down the road where perhaps you could do it that makes it where its consistent throughout the entire course of the game there probably is as far as how it will impact us i dont think much at all
8150168 the 2nd photo looks about right there are only 4 violations that require photos
8150169 the peas received about 2 3 hours of a crash course training
8150170 how things are done in a classroom setting and how it actually translates into practical usage are two very different things this is very new technology to us and we are still getting the hang of it we are slowing but surely refining our methods so that sooner or later our photos could grace the cover of time magazine it should also be noted that management is still working the kinks out of the system and taking feedback from the peas on how to make it better also they are monitoring the photos closely and are constantly reminding us how to take the proper photo
8150171 part of the purpose showing the stickers and taking the photo is not so much to link a sticker which does help to a particular car but we want to show the administrative hearing officers what we see hence the 2 photos and using our comment section on the autocite
8150172 the other part of your question in regards to standards and whether not the ticket is weakened stregthened is thought provoking
8150173 my thoughts are no it does not weaken the ticket at all while it would be great for the photos to be perfect they will at the very least a eliminate the argument that the vehicle wasnt there b that the violation did occur
8150174 without the photos it is the persons word vs our own word one thing both autocites have in common is the fact that it does allow us to enter in comments and give greater detail combine that with the photographic proof and i envision even a greater number of tickets being sustained i will say this people have the right to contest the ticket excercise that right however before you do go online and check out the photos they may save you some time and aggravation of going thru a hearing
8150175 i just think that whether its your 12th year in the league or your second its a pretty somber day just in a sense of there are guys that are potentially losing their jobs

8150189 i just started screen printing about 5 months ago i was a bedding designer in california for the past 4 years until i got laid off in january i moved back to michigan where i grew up and had to find a way to make some money i had taken a screen printing class in college so i knew the basics i looked at some how to videos on youtube and read a few books on the subject and just sort of fumbled my way through figuring out how to do it
8150190 i get inspiration from the weirdest places usually ill glance at something and think its something else that sounds weird lol for example the other day i was driving and i saw this billboard that had a huge key drawn on it but the drawing was pretty bad and i couldnt tell right away what it was and it sort of looked like a city skyline to me a few seconds later i realized that it was a key but i thought that a skyline would look really cool printed on a shirt and now that will be one of my designs coming out on a hoodie for my fall line
8150191 i love working for myself i love the fact that how much money i make is completely up to me i take full responsibility for my income with amazing places like etsy com and the local craft fairs that i do the sky is the limit i find myself working 14 hour days 6 and 7 days a week and it doesnt even faze me because i love what im doing i love my job
8150192 just that i think theyd be really happy with any of the items in my line when i got started i really wanted to be able to affect the way someone feels with my clothing i love going into a dressing room at a store and trying on an outfit that looks so cute on you and makes you feel so good that you have to jump up and down am i the only one that does that anyway thats how i came up with my slogan ellembee hand printed clothes thatll make you jump up and down i love that i get to help people feel good about themselves

8150230 i want to break the good old boy system that currently exists internally in the organization
8150231 bringing professionalism to the pinal county sheriff s office will be refreshing currently there is a lack of leadership i will change that when i m elected sheriff
8150232 i want to break the good old boy system that currently exists internally in the organization
8150233 bringing professionalism to the pinal county sheriff s office will be refreshing currently there is a lack of leadership i will change that when i m elected sheriff
8150234 i m 39 years old and i ve lived in arizona for six years
8150235 i have an associate s degree in law enforcement technology high honors and a bachelor s degree in history and a master s degree in public administration with a focus on government management
8150236 i have a range of law enforcement experience an extensive military background and elected budgeting experience
8150237 even simple training does not currently happen which in my opinion is outrageous in a county as rural as ours
8150238 i want to break the good old boy system that currently exists internally in the organization
8150239 bringing professionalism to the pinal county sheriff s office will be refreshing currently there is a lack of leadership i will change that when i m elected sheriff
8150240 immediately i will change the culture and there will be a focus on training on fairness and discipline
8150241 this will change and enhance the morale of the agency
8150242 it will no longer be this old boy system of who you know it s what you know
8150243 my opponent will always say we don t have the money to do this
8150244 i m tired of the excuses and it is no longer acceptable a higher expectation must be set
8150245 we have to take pinal county and bring it to where it should be
8150246 i enjoy doing for others and participating in their lives
8150247 my hope is to create a partnership between the sheriff s department and the citizens it serves
8150248 i envision pinal county sheriff s department being a leader in the law enforcement arena where we are the agency that leads by example and by leadership that strives to make pinal county second to none
8150249 we need to continue to update with technology advances and to have more training so that we may provide excellent service to the communities of pinal county
8150250 the current regional divisions do not provide adequate coverage or acceptable response times the regional lines must be redrawn and staff reorganized to improve efficiency
8150251 we need to help communities such as johnson ranch and san tan help control and manage the growth so that we can deal with the increased crime that has arrived and by doing so we need more neighborhood block watch programs more volunteers and to increase the sheriff s posse membership in those areas
8150252 i ve worked in just about every area of law enforcement
8150253 i think my overall education and law enforcement experience far exceeds the other candidates
8150254 when i took office i had a plan and that was to move the sheriff s office forward in all aspects
8150255 i think the local service has greatly improved in the johnson ranch area and response times have greatly improved
8150256 i have a vision to make this a very productive law enforcement agency
8150257 i want to see it through to see the job completed
8150258 i see growth taking off again and the calls for service will continue to increase
8150259 so we can keep up with the growth of the county
8150260 my ultimate goal is to make sure the overall crime rate is either at or below the national average and we re close to that now
8150261 those two areas are probably right now the fastest growing areas in pinal county
8150262 my goal is to get additional deputies and to continue to improve communication between the sheriff s office and the citizens
8150263 im a competitor and i get the sense this marketplace doesnt compete

8150285 voy a comenzar por contarte que en el momento de tu ca da al ver que te tomabas la pierna les dije a los que estaban viendo el partido conmigo en casa mart n se jodi l nunca se agarra nada
8150286 vuelvo 10 a os atr s cuando nos conocimos en tandil junto a todos los componentes de un grupo extraordinario con una capacidad de inteligencia muy grande ya te conoc a futbol sticamente pero como se puede conocer a un adversario vi ndolo jugar contra uno por alg n partido en la televisi n o cuando se asiste al estadio como simple espectador
8150287 te ve a algo que me gusta de los 9 y es que te sent as muy bien dentro de los 18 metros del rea donde no todos se encuentran bien hay para todos los gustos en ese puesto los que se tiran atr s para llegar tocando o los que van por los costados pero vos no tu sector era y es el rea grande teniendo adem s una gran virtud saber d nde va a caer el bal n para anticipar al defensor que no lo sabe
8150288 contar con un goleador como vos adem s de otro que desbordaba al nivel de guillermo y otro que constru a y distribu a como rom n significaba que m s de la mitad del trabajo que ten a que hacer para armar el equipo ya estaba hecho
8150289 bendito 98 que nos juntamos todos en el lugar indicado y en el momento justo para cumplir nuestros sue os m s preciados como componentes de un grupo con apetito de triunfos
8150290 futbol sticamente pienso que esos momentos tuyos fueron irrepetibles porque te consolidaste como goleador ante todos los que dudaban y cuestionaban tus cualidades de definidor
8150291 hasta que lleg ese partido en santa fe contra col n el 13 de noviembre de 1999 en el que te rompiste los ligamentos cruzados de la rodilla derecha
8150292 a partir de ah viviste momentos de dudas terribles haci ndonte todas las preguntas posibles despu s de cada sesi n de kine luego pasaste a trabajar en el campo donde de a poco ve as la puerta de salida a medida que empezabas a tocar el bal n y a participar de los picados
8150293 y no me olvido ese entrenamiento al d a siguiente de la derrota por 2 1 contra river en la libertadores en el cual le convertiste dos goles a tu amigo abbondanzieri
8150294 recordar siempre que te agarr al final del mismo y te avis vas a ir al banco el mi rcoles pr ximo y vas a calentar al comienzo del 2 tiempo para entrar cuando falten 30 20 minutos
8150295 te dije adem s que en eso no hab a nadie que deseara tanto que las cosas te salgan bien m s que yo recordar s tambi n a los que no estaban seguros de tu posible vuelta
8150296 si no tomaba esa decisi n no hubieras vivido los momentos que llegaron luego
8150297 a partir de ah en la cuenta regresiva hasta la semana siguiente ten as un gran quilombo en la cabeza porque no esperabas que te dijera eso
8150298 la historia termin bien con el muchachito de la pel cula diciendo aqu estoy de vuelta
8150299 pasamos momentos de charla de todo tipo seg n tus estados de nimo entre ellas una en el t nel de una cancha donde conversamos 30 minutos mientras jugaba la reserva un rato despu s convertir as el gol de la victoria por 1 0
8150300 repasamos tu lesi n de espa a tras la cual tambi n apretaste los dientes y te dijiste por segunda vez voy a volver desde tu regreso a boca llegamos a un presente lleno de satisfacciones preparado para batir todos los r cords de eficacia una cuesti n que esta lesi n quiere impedir pero no lograr porque la vuelta vas a ir program ndola de a poco seg n tu evoluci n en la recuperaci n
8150301 sos un tipo ganador por naturaleza con mucha confianza en vos mismo cualidad que no todos poseen
8150302 sab s muy bien que el sacrificio f sico vas a tener que hacerlo vos pero que seremos muchos los que desearemos volver a verte en un campo de juego conviertiendo en gol una situaci n que para otros no lo era
8150303 mart n como te dije vamos a pele rsela al destino que sepa que sos vos el que decid s cuando vas a dejar de golear no va a ser l con sus piedras en el camino el que nos complicar el final
8150304 volver s y despu s de un par de r cords entre ellos los 206 goles que convert en v lez levantar s los brazos y tendr s todo el derecho de dar las hurras para disfrutar de haber sido el m ximo goleador de los ltimos 15 a os
8150305 toda mi admiraci n y respeto deseando y esperando tu retorno para poder festejar otro gol

8150392 i used the clearview pad on four trips for a total of seventeen nights the trips were a five day cdt trek and desert and canyon country packraft trips one in arizona on the gila river and two on the green river in utah desolation gray canyons and colorado gates of lodore i slept on the pad inside a bozeman mountain works vapr bivy sack or six moon designs serenity nettent the prototype sixty six inch rectangular pad i used on two trips was two ounces over the specified weight of fourteen ounces and made of a slightly thicker material than the production sixty inch 11 5 ounce mummy pad i used on the cdt and gates of lodore trips the clearview is very comfortable for times when insulation is not needed it is more comfortable than two other pads ive slept on in that weight range the bozeman mountain works torsolite and the pacific outdoor equipment uber lite these are both torso length one inch thick self inflating pads the clearview is more comfortable than those pads because it has enough thickness to keep my hip off the ground when i sleep on my side interestingly the clearview is also more comfortable than pacific outdoor equipment max thermo an older version of the ether thermo 6 and big agnes insulated air core pads ive slept on which are just as thick as the clearview pad the reason the clearview is made of polyurethane which is softer and more flexible than the nylon rip stop material in the other pads ive been careful with the clearview and havent needed to repair it it even survived the torture of being used in the big agnes cyclone sl chair kit on my cdt trip id love to see a torso length thirty one inch clearview pad now that would be light
8150393 this is an appropriate way to honor an exemplary young man
8150394 ryan clark was truly a role model for the youth of this community but really a role model for the youth of this nation
8150395 but hes probably smiling and saying ok get it organized
8150396 theyre here theyre dedicated and theyre actively patrolling the roads making sure that we close the summer out with no accidents or fatalities over the labor day weekend
8150397 is due to those who risk their life out there every day
8150398 i dont like to see legal fees adding up if we dont have to have them
8150399 it is within our rules and regulations to pay the attorney fees
8150400 i think that its a prudent use of the tax dollars based on the situation and people just need to understand that coming to these meetings and causing problems will not be tolerated
8150401 i think it provides an opportunity for people who have enough fears going in to perhaps be a little more knowledgeable or a little more comfortable going into it
8150402 the two grants put us really in the limelight and give us the funding to pursue this research over the next five years showcase us as one of the national leaders and then that makes us an attractive place for pharmaceutical companies to bring trials here
8150403 so basically from the front end to the actual implementation of the treatment theres somebody guiding them through the comprehensive management plan
8150404 four years ago if you said wed be at a hillary happy hour at the dnc i would have called you crazy but today is a great opportunity for people who agree that sen barack obama doesnt have the experience to be president of the united states
8150405 if you need to tell me youre a vampire tell me now
8150406 ill tell you what its not even worth it these fucking stars dont shine bright enough in this place
8150407 locksley im going to cut your heart out with a spoon
8150408 hes big and strong and got plenty of size but hes also got some really good hands if he puts the time into it hes got a chance to do some good things
8150409 its been a long summer watching some of the other guys sign and then it was finally a done deal a couple of weeks ago
8150410 i knew i could play at the next level i just needed someone to give me the opportunity
8150411 i love coming out here with him he has such a good time with it
8150412 it doesnt matter what score he shoots he has a good time
8150413 i missed it i missed that thrill of hitting the ball even out of the woods
8150414 golf is just awesome your brain has to work all the time i said ive got to go back but its not like riding a bike ive been working at it
8150415 the ball was in the rough next to a green it was sitting up there like an ice cream cone
8150416 someone said do that flop shot i did it it was just exhilarating to see it
8150417 when i got in these tournaments i got serious again but i said ive got a long way to go
8150418 i got there wednesday and played 18 holes a day and then went and chipped and putted and went to that driving range
8150419 hes the backbone of golf the enthusiast that he is
8150420 its unusual to find someone so enthusiastic about golf at his age
8150421 we might be flipping through the channels and hed stop at golf for a minute and then move on
8150422 ive always said that im a participator not a spectator
8150423 everything ive ever done pool basketball motorcycle racing i was always in the top five
8150424 people asked me why i was playing it was because i wanted to play with guys i could learn from
8150425 i wanted to watch people who knew how to play
8150426 but i didnt practice like i should have and when i couldnt break par i faded out
8150427 i had put a lot of effort into getting into the mid 70s but i wasnt willing to put in the practice i needed to get to that next level
8150428 without a doubt i have the ability but it takes a lot of practice
8150429 im going to be practicing over the winter it doesnt matter how cold it is

8150431 the way they planned it tonight was supposed to be sort of the personal michelle obama will talk about barack obama personally ted kennedy was a very personal emotional speech
8150432 but i guarantee on the first night of the republican convention youre going to hear talk about barack obama commander in chief tax cuts et cetera et cetera
8150433 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
8150434 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8150435 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8150436 hillary clinton is able to stop this kind of behavior easily
8150437 my view is we need to come together as a party
8150438 i admire hillary clinton greatly but i think it would be divisive to have a vote on the floor we need to have a unanimous vote
8150439 i get a kick out of when people ask will this work on this level
8150440 are we playing in the nfc east last time i looked the last six years at navy we were playing division i teams we played five or six teams from the acc and we played notre dame every year we played rutgers so i dont think its a question of fundamentally will it work
8150441 thats why i laugh when i hear people say can it work it aint like weve been doing something thats never been done weve been doing it for 20 years and its worked for three different schools pretty good
8150442 there are some people that any time you do anything thats just a little bit different they say its not gonna work
8150443 i wish he had chosen someone else i really do georgia tech has me scared because theyre really really different to anything we have in this conference or the sec
8150444 i think hell be great and i think hell drive people crazy hell certainly keep some defensive coordinators up at night
8150445 evidently he thought i could do it and i said ok
8150446 we ran the same system wishbone as when i played so i just kind of got plugged into it
8150447 we tried that for two games and we werent very successful
8150448 so i told him i wanted to go back in the double slot
8150449 through the years it evolved and its kind of a combination of run and shoot and play action passing and option component
8150450 i dont think that our system is such that it has to have a specific type of player
8150451 good players are going to be good no matter what system you run
8150452 we want people who want to buy in and want to be here
8150453 we dont want guys around who dont want to be here ive learned in life that there are some guys who dont buy into anything
8150454 he has his offense he believes in it and has made believers out of us
8150455 hes a my way or the highway kind of guy so you either buy in or hit the road
8150456 its not like weve got nine starters coming back on offense who were used to a system and were coming in and destroying it
8150457 well probably throw the ball more than we did at navy just because of who weve got to play with
8150458 contrary to popular opinion im not diametrically opposed to the forward pass
8150459 i think this offense has a lot of potential and i cant wait to start running it
8150460 its the kind of thing that if everybody buys in and executes properly then we will be able to rack up a lot of yards and score a lot of points
8150461 wake forest would be a 3 on the scale of this option stuff georgia tech would be a 10 and a half
8150462 if everybody does the same thing then dont it just come down to who recruits the best it makes sense to me that the schools who are gonna get the best recruits are gonna win every year so i think its good that theres differences
8150463 its difficult because you only get basically three days to prepare
8150464 its tough to get a scout team to simulate the precision
8150465 i think if you look at a team like navy they dont have a lot of acc caliber athletes but they were still able to score a ridiculous amount of points
8150466 this kind of option attack hasnt really been seen recently in the acc so unless they played navy in past years it is going to be new it will be tough to prepare for with a lot of misdirection so teams that play us will really never know whats coming at them
8150467 i never worried about the next job or moving up i never did
8150468 i just always felt like if you did a good job of where youre at it will take care of itself
8150469 i mean i was as happy as a pig in slop at georgia southern i could have stayed there for whatever i loved living there and we had a good time then the people at navy convinced me there was something i needed to take a look at then when i got there i would have been happy coaching there till i quit but when i had the opportunity at tech i thought ok that seems like a good opportunity and i came
8150470 theyve won several games in a row and i can look at the tape and make a case for how the games could have gone the other way
8150471 and a couple of times they beat tech up so its up to us to change it it doesnt do any good to cry about it youve got to go out there and change it
8150472 i think theres some excitement and i think theres a buzz in our fan base
8150473 im looking forward to getting started and going out there and seeing what happens
8150474 the only way youre ever going to go silence the critics is to go do it on the field
8150475 weve got a good five weeks here for me to rehab and get a good sense of how im recovering and what it looks like
8150476 then i think we will all have a better idea
8150477 my focus right now is trying to get a little better range of motion each day from now until the end of the season and then start worrying about all that other stuff
8150478 we have that mind set that were better this year
8150479 we need to put it all together and have that winning season
8150480 we feel like itll be a good measuring stick to see where were at
8150481 he used to be a little michael vick out there
8150482 we just have to prove to everybody that it wasnt a fluke
8150483 we just have to gain the experience were working hard to get there

8150494 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
8150495 puts russia in opposition to the security council resolution to which it is a party
8150496 this is contrary to the principles of the independence the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia
8150497 this is in violation of the principle of territorial integrity which is one of the basic principles of international law and this is therefore absolutely unacceptable
8150498 russia must understand that its violations of international law carry consequences
8150499 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
8150500 puts russia in opposition to the security council resolution to which it is a party
8150501 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8150502 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8150503 we were all very interested to see her reasons for supporting barack obama and so i think its very clear tonight that she was a strong messenger that we have to change our country and that its ok even though we supported hillary clinton in the past to unite behind barack obama
8150504 even though i cant vote im trying my best to support obama and get the word out about how great he is and what an inspiration hes going to be
8150505 ive met a lot of women who switched from hillary to mccain just because they were upset so i think its really really important that she came here its a great thing she had everyone on their feet clapping for her it was an inspiring speech and i think that it spoke to everyone
8150506 people were clinging to her every word in many ways
8150507 she put things in proper perspective she clearly said that it wasnt about her it was about the many americans who are suffering the many americans who want change in this country and so i think that weve left a better and more united party
8150508 it will take us some time but we will be a united party and because of both leaders were going to be a stronger party and well feel that power in november
8150509 we all knew we had two really great leaders here even when our family was divided we were not the ones making fun of each other for that choice
8150510 as long as were not voting mccain i think were all cool about that we really got lucky with hillary and obama this year its great that theyve come together
8150511 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8150512 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8150513 there are more illegal immigrants pouring into the united states than ever
8150514 you see most of latinos are here because of the great inflation that was caused by american companies in latin america
8150515 as different as we have been taught to look at each other by colonial society we are in the same struggle and until we realize that well be fighting for scraps from the table of a system that has kept us subservient instead of being self determined and thats why we have no control over when the embargo will stop in cuba or when the bombs will stop dropping in vieques
8150516 im from where the gold and diamonds are ripped from the earth right next to the slave castles where the water is cursed from where police brutalitys not half as nice it makes the hood in america look like paradise compared to the aids infested caribbean slum african streets where the passports an american gun from where they massacre people and try to keep it quiet and spend the next 25 years trying deny it
8150517 hey youre going to street scene my name is how are you doing today
8150518 this problem started two years ago before the eskom power cuts and has recently escalated to daily power cuts
8150519 as ratepayers we are entitled to electricity i tried to contact the municipality and our ward councillor but received no response if the matter is not dealt with residents are going to form a trust account via an attorney and deposit our money meant for rates into that account until the problem is resolved
8150520 i am fed up two sundays ago our electricity was interrupted four times i tried to take the issue up with the city manager mike sutcliffe and our ward councillor rabi gobind but there has been no improvement
8150521 the squatters electricity problems are the municipalitys concern not ours we want our electricity to be connected all the time
8150522 last thursday night i was printing work off my computer for the next days moderation when the lights went out
8150523 i have been reduced to studying by candle light which is frustrating i am concerned about my performance in the current trial examination
8150524 i sent several e mails to the municipality but have received no response
8150525 if the municipality can provide water and sanitation for squatters why cant they provide us with electricity
8150526 i am cooking on a gas stove and simple tasks like preparing a meal has become difficult the food in our refrigerator is often spoilt
8150527 once the investigation is complete and we receive permission from council to contact the land owners in which the informal settlers are currently occupying we can request their permission to install temporary electricity boxes on their properties which will provide power for the settlement
8150528 i am sympathetic towards the problems residents face and am trying to resolve the issues speedily
8150529 we have cleared out squatters alongside the kenville area where residents are experiencing similar illegal power cuts and like kenville we are trying to introduce 24 hour security patrols in sea cow lake these security checks will help identify the culprits
8150530 we have requested more teams to join the patrol so more areas can be covered
8150531 the council is trying to allocate land for housing for informal settlers not only in sea cow lake but all areas that face similar problems
8150532 never have i witnessed such sincere hospitality and overwhelming spirit of true brotherhood as is practiced by people of all colors and races here in this ancient holy land the home of abraham muhammad and all the other prophets of the holy scriptures
8150533 i have been blessed to visit the holy city of mecca i have made my seven circuits around the kaba led by a young mutawaf named muhammad i drank water from the well of the zam zam i ran seven times back and forth between the hills of mt al safa and al marwah i have prayed in the ancient city of mina and i have prayed on mt arafat
8150534 there were tens of thousands of pilgrims from all over the world they were of all colors from blue eyed blondes to black skinned africans but we were all participating in the same ritual displaying a spirit of unity and brotherhood that my experiences in america had led me to believe never could exist between the white and non white
8150535 america needs to understand islam because this is the one religion that erases from its society the race problem throughout my travels in the muslim world i have met talked to and even eaten with people who in america would have been considered white but the white attitude was removed from their minds by the religion of islam i have never before seen sincere and true brotherhood practiced by all colors together irrespective of their color
8150536 you may be shocked by these words coming from me but on this pilgrimage what i have seen and experienced has forced me to rearrange much of my thought patterns previously held and to toss aside some of my previous conclusions this was not too difficult for me despite my firm convictions i have always been a man who tries to face facts and to accept the reality of life as new experience and new knowledge unfolds it i have always kept an open mind which is necessary to the flexibility that must go hand in hand with every form of intelligent search for truth
8150537 during the past eleven days here in the muslim world i have eaten from the same plate drunk from the same glass and slept on the same rug while praying to the same god with fellow muslims whose eyes were the bluest of blue whose hair was the blondest of blond and whose skin was the whitest of white and in the words and in the deeds of the white muslims i felt the same sincerity that i felt among the black african muslims of nigeria sudan and ghana
8150538 we were truly all the same brothers because their belief in one god had removed the white from their minds the white from their behavior and the white from their attitude
8150539 i could see from this that perhaps if white americans could accept the oneness of god then perhaps too they could accept in reality the oneness of man and cease to measure and hinder and harm others in terms of their differences in color
8150540 with racism plaguing america like an incurable cancer the so called christian white american heart should be more receptive to a proven solution to such a destructive problem perhaps it could be in time to save america from imminent disaster the same destruction brought upon germany by racism that eventually destroyed the germans themselves
8150541 each hour here in the holy land enables me to have greater spiritual insights into what is happening in america between black and white the american negro never can be blamed for his racial animosities he is only reacting to four hundred years of the conscious racism of the american whites but as racism leads america up the suicide path i do believe from the experiences that i have had with them that the whites of the younger generation in the colleges and universities will see the handwriting on the walls and many of them will turn to the spiritual path of truth the only way left to america to ward off the disaster that racism inevitably must lead to
8150542 never have i been so highly honored never have i been made to feel more humble and unworthy who would believe the blessings that have been heaped upon an american negro a few nights ago a man who would be called in america a white man a united nations diplomat an ambassador a companion of kings gave me his hotel suite his bed never would i have even thought of dreaming that i would ever be a recipient of such honors honors that in america would be bestowed upon a king not a negro

8150553 ondanks de grote vraag naar het trappistenbier van westmalle hebben de monniken opnieuw besloten om de productie niet te verhogen het bier van de trappistenorde in het belgische westmalle is in trek in binnen en buitenland al jaren geldt een productiebeperking van het trappistenbier recent heeft de orde bekeken of de productie toch niet zou kunnen worden uitgebreid opnieuw is echter besloten niet meer bier te gaan brouwen minder aanbod en een hogere vraag leiden tot een hogere prijs maar aan het besluit van de monniken ligt geen economische reden ten grondslag om het geld is het de monniken niet te doen de bewoners van de abdij van onze lieve vrouw van het heilig hart van westmalle vinden dat een productieverhoging te veel investeringen zou eisen nog belangrijker is echter dat de verhoging een grote invloed zou hebben op het persoonlijke leven van de werknemers broeder benedikt geeft in een verklaring aan dat de orde er veel waarde aan hecht de menselijke maat te behouden bij het brouwen van het trappistenbier we zouden ook een extra ploeg kunnen inzetten of overwerk toestaan maar daar zijn we niet voor we vinden het belangrijk dat onze lekenmedewerkers op een redelijk uur naar huis kunnen gaan zodat er tijd rest voor hun familiale en sociale leven we willen ook het persoonlijke contact behouden met deze mensen en dat is bij een schaalvergroting misschien niet meer mogelijk de monniken accepteren dat de productiebeperking gevolgen zal hebben voor de beschikbaarheid van het bier maar hopen dat probleem zo eerlijk mogelijk op te lossen af en toe komt een verdeelpunt tijdelijk zonder voorraad te zitten volledig buiten de wil om van de handelaar of de winkelketen om dit zo veel mogelijk te vermijden verdeelt de trappistenbrouwerij het beschikbare bier op een eerlijke en billijke manier zowel over grote als kleinere distributiepunten aldus de orde

8150586 in flickr we find an altered temporal relationship to the everyday image a leveling of the hierarchy between professional and amateur a unique sense of a community of viewers producers as well as a differing relationship to the collection display categorization and distribution of the digital image instead of evoking loss preservation and death users and viewers are encouraged to establish a connection with the image that is simultaneously fleeting and a building block of a biographical or social narrative while these sites build a collection they also privilege the immediacy of the image and acknowledge the inability of photography to hold onto time even as it provides avenues for nostalgia and memory in addition on the photo sites at least the everyday communal aesthetic that has been constructed is one that privileges the small the mundane the urban and the industrial while digital photography has not revolutionized photography or led to a loss of the authenticity of an image as predicted early on it has significantly altered our relationship to the practice of photography when coupled with social networking software as well as our expectations for and interactions with the image and an everyday aesthetic

8150629 they told me that a little kid had been running around in the parents room and had briefly seen what i was doing and had complained to its mum she said
8150630 the mum then complained to security and the cleaner came in to inspect what i was doing they told me the complaint was that there was a topless woman eating her lunch in the parents room
8150631 its tough enough that i have to do this during my break but for a complaint to be made about me doing it is really upsetting
8150632 theres a public ignorance and theres still a lack of knowledge around breastfeeding and how it works she said
8150633 this mother was very humiliated and something like this could have seen the end of her expressing milk or working

8150691 of course i know the problems they will not go away i have documented the problems before and if you have an hour i could document them again
8150692 i had great affinity with england for seven years i dont like the reactions and i know the problems an england manager has more than anyone else and people are finding that out now
8150693 again it is an over reaction to a defeat i experienced that and we are experiencing it again but england have one of the top managers in the world in capello and i wish them good luck in the qualifiers
8150694 but england is not my problem any more the only thing i am worried about or bothered about is being successful with fc twente
8150695 they have given me an opportunity to work in holland at a good club with good people and i want to pay them back

8150700 johns had a lot of success against a lot of teams
8150701 i know the numbers are very good against those guys johns just a good pitcher and hes putting together a good career
8150702 i pretty much went through the first three innings with just my two seam fastball
8150703 that helped me get some early count outs then i added a pitch every inning after that working in my breaking pitches
8150704 i was throwing a lot of strikes pounding the strike zone theres different things you have to do with different teams
8150705 i used to throw more four seam fastballs and strike out more guys
8150706 but that gets your pitch count up there thats why ive kind of integrated that the two seamer the last couple years part of the learning process part of adding to your game i guess
8150707 today felt like the old team from 10 days ago
8150708 we were just trying to take him to right center these lefties like to throw a lot of offspeed stuff we just wanted to stay on it take it the other way if we had to

8150715 there were 150 people who were lining the shores watching this guy jump off my dock

8150729 no est haciendo nada eficaz porque la sociedad civil no ha sido capaz de producir costos sociales y pol ticos para que el gobierno haga algo
8150730 en alg n momento hay que tomar en cuenta que todos tenemos responsabilidad sin desenfocar el reclamo que tenemos que hacer a las autoridades del cumplimiento de la responsabilidad de proteger sus derechos humanos

8150738 im unprepared for whats on the table tonight i thought i was coming for a noise issue

8150743 there is a fair amount of public private partnership success here and looking at the velocity of deals we felt the need to place a dedicated team here

8150750 right now i am getting my visa as soon as it is ready i will fly to london to sign a contract
8150751 i will not play in kiev everything has happened very quickly so i could not even say goodbye to my team mates
8150752 the only thing that stopped me from leaving was my family
8150753 but now all doubts are behind me and i decided to sign a contract with tottenham and the formalities are practically settled
8150754 there is a concrete sum which tottenham proposed and we have agreed the amount
8150755 it would take a hell on an offer to let him go but ive not heard anything from anyone and i dont envisage anything happening at this late stage
8150756 i have seen camara play against my teams in the past and score against us
8150757 i didnt even know what was happening with him in the summer but hes now here for another year and im sure hes got a part to play
8150758 he was one of the best when i was in russia
8150759 he is very quick technically he is very good he is good in one on one situations and he can make chances for other players
8150760 how he would do in england is difficult to know i didnt know how i was going to do in england
8150761 he is a good player and i would like to see him in england it would be good for him to come to see how good it is here compared to russia
8150762 we have not forgotten what we did last season but we know what we need to do again this year
8150763 we need to show we are a good team we want to have the same experiences and show we are still focussed and ready to win more trophies
8150764 they are owned by one of the biggest companies in the world so they have money which is important now
8150765 it means they can buy good players as well as finding their own which they do very well

8150773 were going to have to be starting classes without knowing how much money were going to receive
8150774 we are going to have to find a way of managing our budget so that were less vulnerable to the wide fluctuations of the state budget
8150775 this is world class talent the sort that berkeley hasnt had in the recent past
8150776 were hoping with their leadership that well be able to change our budget process
8150777 the one thing we need to protect here is the education of our students
8150778 in the short term were going to have to cut back significantly on our hiring of new faculty so were not going to be replacing most of the faculty who retire
8150779 we hope not the one thing we need to protect here is the education of our students
8150780 the rise in the cost of living and in fees was more than offset by the increase in our financial aid package and thats in part because of good management
8150781 it was very unfamiliar coming in but its been nothing but a big welcome
8150782 if anyone had any question of the value of our student athletes they need only look back at the olympic statistics i provided you
8150783 we are extraordinarily proud of our athletes and want to provide them with the safest and best facilities that we can
8150784 its really unfortunate that all the legal proceedings have extended the physical danger to our students for almost a year and a half and i think the people responsible should be ashamed of themselves
8150785 here where the air is loaded with iodine and where the ultra violet ray is ever present in our smiling sunshine your health and happiness is our business

8150819 a revised country health plan was expected by the end of this month but there is no guarantee it will be ready by then

8150821 minister hill made the announcement he would be amending his ill conceived plan at the end of july to take the heat off his department following the exposure of a radiation bungle at the royal adelaide hospital
8150822 minister hill told country residents he would have a new plan for them at the end of august and now his office is saying that might not be happening
8150823 now it has been exposed the new plan may not even be ready and the minister true to his style is nowhere to be seen
8150824 it is contemptible that minister hill is going to produce a plan before his own taskforce has completed its investigation
8150825 south australians deserve a health system which provides safe and efficient care for everyone not a system which is being downgraded and dismantled by a government which is out of touch
8150826 yesterday she said the revised plan shouldnt be released this month today she is saying it should be released this month

8150870 should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in new zealand
8150871 the greens believe that children are the same as adults as soon as they are born
8150872 deserve at least as much protection from violence under the law as
8150873 should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in new zealand
8150874 would you happily stand by and watch someone else friend teacher aunt etc smack your child or is this a holier than thou only i may use violence against my child situation
8150875 do you think you physically own your child or do you believe they are little individuals and its your job to raise and care for them until they can care for themselves
8150876 ive always wondered why do smackers favour hitting children on the bottom really is it because it hurts more there
8150877 to those who advocate smacking would you happily stand by and watch someone else friend teacher aunt etc smack your child or is this a holier than thou only i may use violence against my child situation
8150878 children need to learn that if you take on a bigger person than yourself you will probably loose they need to learn that cars and big mack trucks dont care about childrens rights they need to learn that their actions are directly linked to all those around them obviously if a two year old decides he is going to fearlessly take on the whole world some one has to moderate his ambition a strong willed two year old in full flight is a sight you never forget a strategic smack on the bum can literally save his life
8150879 as i have pointed out elsewhere it is now technically illegal to even physically restrain a child and force them to sit on a naughty mat please explain how you can discipline a violent child without breaking the law

8150905 were getting all the gold we can find and turning it into diamonds
8150906 one of the most amazing national media marketing related sales we had was in last septembers auction
8150907 though the domain didnt go for much money bidding was very spirited with some 50 people getting in on the action in the end the national media marketing domain went to a well established marketing firm who did not disclose their future plans for it
8150908 i wish i had started this stuff five years earlier id be making bank
8150909 but hindsite is always 20 20 and im 100 percent certain there is still lots of money to be made last year alone domain sales for national media marketing companies topped 10 million dollars which tallied up to be a record setting year
8150910 we got stuck with a co uk version of the domain we wanted
8150911 but we played it to our advantage by marketing heavily to those in the uk and beefing up local seo in great britain the results show for themselves we had record breaking profits last quarter
8150912 this is good news for all those in the national media marketing marketing business
8150913 and the fact that internet related marketing only diminishes in cost over time means that soon original domain name purchases will be dirt cheap
8150914 email is so ingrained into the backbone of the national media marketing internet sector that many forget about it when buying a domain
8150915 but when you think about it you want a domain that people can remember and a domain that is free of any blacklist status so that you can use it to freely communicate with national media marketing customers
8150916 is that they are universal around the world once you lock up a short simple domain you can market the hell out of it and cash in on the high revenue national media marketing industry
8150917 privacy is absolutely key in the national media marketing business
8150918 once top domains are registered their security protection and legacy becomes mission critical
8150919 i think the potential for success marketing in most all countries so why not casino games
8150920 i believe that online casinos can thrive in the east if they are marketed correctly that means outstanding customer service a realistic gaming experience and good deposit options
8150921 when you cant throw a expletive strike you cant get anyone out
8150922 its frustrating for all of us were all trying to get after it to do our best and stay with the big boys with all these first place teams and were just falling short
8150923 theyre not the best team in baseball for no reason they adjust to you i was throwing some good pitches but they werent swinging but theres no excuse for giving away a three run lead
8150924 we came back but we just made some boneheaded mistakes that cost us this game we should have scored more in a few innings
8150925 were trying in here we are we got rid of some good players and it hurt us but you know we turned the page were trying our best were young its going to happen so people need to get over it
8150926 one thing you can say about this team is that its battled all year long and it did again tonight
8150927 it grinds on you when come back especially against a team like chicago take the lead lose the lead take the lead lose the lead but its a pretty close knit bunch out there theyll come back and battle tomorrow

8150948 since multimedia often transcends linguistic barriers we thought it apt to help translate a multimedia player into local languages we chose vlc because it is undoubtedly the most popular open source media player available
8150949 at translate org za we believe that people express themselves best in their own language and people should be encouraged to create multimedia such as podcasts and sound bytes in their native languages
8150950 our way of empowering local languages is to help make popular software in these languages available
8150951 we also make it easier for volunteers by providing a simple web based translation system called pootle which is hosted at pootle locamotion org which makes it easy for anyone to help translate software
8150952 weve split the vlc language file into more workable chunks to make the number of source words more manageable
8150953 organisations such as ours can freely use open source software as a catalyst for creating language communities
8150954 anyone who wants to help translate vlc into their language can make use of our translation system

8151149 also wir reden ber die bundesliga und den neuen batman film oder
8151150 ich halte die risiken der politischen szenarien in hessen f r unvertretbar
8151151 wird das sie selbst die spd in hessen und die bundes spd vor der bundestagswahl schwer besch digen
8151152 ist sie abh ngig von der linken und den traumata des herrn lafontaine sie begibt sich in die h nde einer partei die einfluss ohne verantwortung ohne jede verpflichtung h tte die w chentlich daf r sorgen kann dass regierungsf higkeit wieder verloren geht
8151153 es st rt mich dass die linke nicht in eine politische haftung genommen werden w rde darauf hat franz m ntefering schon im februar hingewiesen
8151154 nicht vorstellen mit leuten auf einer bank zu sitzen die zum teil mitverantwortlich waren diese geschichte nicht aufarbeiten und sich nicht davon distanzieren
8151155 feststellen dass die reformen zwar f r unser land notwendig waren wie aber daf r nicht belohnt worden sind
8151156 wieso die spd hat ein interesse daran stark in die bundestagswahl zu gehen und sich nicht selbst zu besch digen
8151157 es gibt abw rtsrisiken die ich nicht untersch tze aber ich widerspreche allen die schnellz ngig eine rezession herbeireden wir sind in keiner rezession
8151158 ich erinnere wie das in den 70 er und 80 er jahren gelaufen ist die schulden sind gestiegen der abschwung kam trotzdem

8151166 jaime prendi fuego a aerol neas y quiere aparecer ahora como bombero salvador
8151167 prendi fuego a la empresa y quiere aparecer ahora como el bombero salvador
8151168 jaime no le est diciendo la verdad a los diputados y supongo que hoy tampoco le va a decir la verdad a los senadores est ocultando las cifras sobre la deuda de aerol neas est dando cifras que no son las correctas est enga ando a los diputados porque le interesa que le aprueben su proyecto
8151169 responsables de que el pa s tenga que hacerse cargo de los restos del titanic
8151170 no quiere ni necesita saber c mo va el mercado a reo argentino
8151171 l por jaime de alguna manera le prendi fuego y ahora quiere ser el bombero salvador
8151172 para invertir en argentina hay que ser experimentado porque no es f cil entrar ac cualquier cosa que quieras hacer necesitas el visto bueno del gobierno necesitas que alguien de un ministerio te d una mano
8151173 el verdadero impulsor de la situaci n que en este momento padece aerol neas
8151174 no le ha permitido sobrevivir la ha tenido asfixiada con falta de actualizaciones de tarifas con una posici n absolutamente radical en cuanto al movimiento de aerol neas
8151175 tienen una gran culpa por supuesto los propietarios actuales de aerol neas argentinas es decir el grupo marsans porque no ha sabido conducirse la compa a con un criterio empresarial adecuado a la situaci n
8151176 est compartida la culpa las dos partes son responsables de haber llevado a la compa a a una situaci n para que el pa s tenga que absorber algo
8151177 jaime es el culpable sino es al cien por ciento por lo menos el 50 por ciento
8151178 no han sabido manejar la compa a eso es evidente
8151179 la deuda de aerol neas es m vil aumenta cada d a
8151180 cuando se haga una auditor a ver n que la deuda es mucho mayor que lo que l en alusi n a jaime est manejando de 890 millones de d lares y va a ser mucho mayor todav a por las p rdidas que hoy est teniendo
8151181 jaime lo que ha hecho es ocultar la realidad para tratar de sacar un proyecto que l mismo impuls de generar esta discusi n
8151182 aerol neas tiene que ser salvada y rescatada por el estado pero no a cualquier precio es decir hoy a la situaci n a la que se llega es como consecuencia de las medidas hostiles que desde la secretar a se han hecho contra aerol neas argentinas
8151183 a genuine confession of faith invariably provokes opposition from the false church and from the world precisely because in its witness to gods free grace for all people it constitutes a radical attack upon the false church and the world as a fighting action of the church it runs against the stream according to matt ch 10 the confessors will be hated by all men a mans foes will be those of his own household and he will be dragged before governors and kings for christs sake
8151184 a genuine confession therefore will not merely confess declare and teach implicitly or explicitly it will also condemn reject and anathematize the opposing error this feature of a confession has often been lamented and denounced on the ground of its intolerance and lovelessness the truth is that the negative exists for the sake of the positive for the sake of definiteness and clarity hitler had no objections to christians who confessed that jesus is lord but he was enraged when they confessed that jesus is lord and hitler is not moreover the damnamus like the woes jesus pronounced upon the pharisees has to be uttered just for the sake of a genuine love for the erring brethren to spare them the anathema would be neither loving nor truthful obviously the anathema ought not to be excised rashly or self righteously but if we do not have the confidence to say we condemn if we still want to indulge in innocuous sweet sounding affirmations that can neither give offense nor engender strong loyalties then it is a sure sign that we are not ready to confess at all
8151185 so they got santana going tonight you think we should go with feliz or dobbs
8151186 this isnt part of the punishment but aims to reduce the likelihood that they will need to be punished again the question is do you want them out there with treatment or without it

8151190 to the investigators who worked on these cases and i the deaths of inmates casey and norman seem to raise serious questions about inmate management and health care practices within the multnomah county corrections system and the level of health services
8151191 every day with the prison population the people that are charged to take care of their health have to make a tremendous amount of decisions and were not talking about a well population here
8151192 ricky sean craft ii was charged monday with agars murder
8151193 it truly has the opportunity to become iconic in terms of putting sandy on the map not only in utah but in the intermountain area
8151194 every day id stand next to the chicago river and look at that building and try to figure out what it would look like in sandy
8151195 but most of them know theyre not here to make it rich
8151196 they will be tempted there are people out there who are all over those guys
8151197 i compliment mendenhall and rose for what they are doing here as long as it lasts
8151198 i would have been out of a job within a few years if id gone to detroit
8151199 its not so much that were trying to measure up against anyone else
8151200 what i try to do is keep in communication with coaches to keep them coaching here they are good coaches who could undoubtedly make more money elsewhere and someday that might happen
8151201 one theres a notion that some portion of your time needs to be service in that is implied some sacrifice relative to what you might get elsewhere second they want to be fair and give sufficient for your needs third something unique over the past four or five years theres a willingness to entertain and discuss what the market is like out there
8151202 as we talk its not me me me its we we we
8151203 with what were doing here at an lds church owned school its probably not appropriate to pay a coach 2 million but byu president cecil samuelson has been supportive
8151204 the only way i can look at it is are coaches happy here thats an ongoing thing we keep talking
8151205 he really is all right were going to be ok

8151215 do you think itd be alright if i could just crash here tonight you see im in no shape for driving and anyway ive got no place to go
8151216 i love you and not in a friendly way although i think were great friends and not in a misplaced affection puppy dog way although im sure thats what youll call it and its not because youre unattainable i love you very simple very truly youre the epitome of every attribute and quality ive ever looked for in another person i know you think of me as just a friend and crossing that line is the furthest thing from an option youd ever consider but i cant do this any longer i cant stand next to you without wanting to hold you i cant look into your eyes without feeling that longing you only read about in trashy romance novels i cant talk to you without wanting to express my love for everything you are i know this will probably queer our friendship no pun intended but i had to say it because ive never felt this before and i like who i am because of it and if bringing it to light means we cant hang out anymore then that hurts me but i couldnt allow another day to go by without getting it out there regardless of the outcome which by the look on your face is to be the inevitable shoot down and ill accept that but i know some part of you is hesitating for a moment and if there is a moment of hesitation that means you feel something too all i ask is that you not suppress that at least for ten minutes and try to dwell in it before you dismiss it there isnt another soul on this fucking planet whos ever made me the person i am when im with you and i would risk this friendship for the chance to take it to the next plateau because its there between you and me you cant deny that and even if we never speak again after tonight please know that im forever changed because of you and what youve meant to me which while i do appreciate it id never need a painting of birds bought at a diner to remind me of
8151217 i take it out on the keys cause i dont have the guts
8151218 its been a long time friend but i wont tell you where ive been just where were going sun where clouds hung sound breaking silence i see you friend gold that weighs like lead seams stretched taut youve been walking heavily but id like to help you carry that heart of yours
8151219 be of sober spirit be on the alert your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour
8151220 no temptation will overtake you except that is common to man and god is faithful who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also so that you will be able to endure it
8151221 but resist him firm in your faith knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world after you have suffered for a little while the god of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in christ will himself perfect confirm strengthen and establish you to him be the dominion forever and ever amen

8151228 the dod approached us with the requirement of automating device scans to eliminate the risk of disconnected laptops missing regularly scheduled va scan sessions and posing a threat to the production network upon re entry in addition the dod needed a way to limit network access to non iava compliant devices to address this joint requirement we looked to forescout by adding the forescout counteract plug in to our scanner eeye was able to meet the dod requirement of real time detection of connecting devices automating our ability to conduct iava scans
8151229 now if a dod network user connects an infected or out of compliance computer that needs malware removal os updates security patches or anti virus software installed the retina web security scanner will detect it immediately using counteract the device will be placed in a dmz zone for remediation and based on the scan results and the nac policy in place the device will be brought back into compliance before it is allowed to fully connect to the production network this eliminates laptop vulnerabilities in real time and preserves the vital uptime of dod networks

8151495 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway

8151533 wow i hope i dont fail as many times as that kid
8151534 i was trying to give my fans an inspirational record that they can learn from and not just listen to
8151535 hes been doing it for 20 years and he has the same energy
8151536 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
8151537 it is time to take back the country we love
8151538 proud supporter of barack obama and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8151539 no i can never seem to get a table there
8151540 its just that they dont have the right table at the right time
8151541 well its good here anyway and have you tried the schnitzel
8151542 plug in america co founder paul scott is blogging this week from the democratic national convention where he and a group of clean car supporters are advocating for plug in vehicles with the electric vehicle rolling showcase the blog is available at
8151543 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example
8151544 the language centre of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
8151545 the brain areas that are responsible for language in an adult do not learn how to process language during development but rather they are specialized at least in part to process language from the start
8151546 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8151547 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8151548 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8151549 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8151550 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful
8151551 our evidence indicates the earliest inhabitants of palau were of normal stature and it counters the evidence that berger et al presented in their paper indicating there was a reduced stature population in early palau
8151552 our research from whole bones and whole skeletons indicates that the earliest individuals in palau were of normal stature but gracile in other words they were thin
8151553 i think bergers primary mistakes were his not understanding the variation in the skeletal population in which he was working
8151554 the weather the terrain and the darkness will be the main concern for the search people

8151559 we were shooting in villages and people were very curious so we let them be a part of the film either as actors or helpers so there were a lot of smiles and it was such a pleasant experience
8151560 the chittagong uprising of 1930 34 has never been hailed as the important event that it was it shook the very foundations of the british administration
8151561 it was well received by historians and book lovers but it was definitely not a bestseller
8151562 ashutosh came to me right after lagaan showing a keen interest in the film eventually he got busy with swades and jodhaa akbar and i thought he had forgotten all about the project
8151563 he wanted the rights to the book and asked me to join his research team
8151564 i admire gowarikers integrity i have seen only three films of his swades lagaan and jodhaa akbar and his honesty as a filmmaker shines through in these efforts
8151565 in fact it was shekhar kapur who recommended the book to gowariker
8151566 my book is as much about the young teenagers who were involved in the chittagong attack as it is about sen in fact there are more than twenty important characters in it
8151567 in many ways its like lagaan it will require a lot of raw talent
8151568 i think it will be very unfair to interfere with the directors vision

8151575 i wanted him to touch it i know a little bit more about duckett how he plays
8151576 i have to find out what the fits going to be
8151577 both of them are pretty much downhill runners and no defensive back likes that
8151578 i dont think well do that during the season but theyre both going to play
8151579 i got a little chance to run the ball a little bit they wanted to see me touch it
8151580 at first i was like nah coach i dont know if i remember how to do that
8151581 but thats kind of my second nature there right now the emphasis is to continue working on my blocking
8151582 but this year its going to be even harder there are some tough decisions to be made

8151588 karenanya wajar jika muncul asumsi bahwa pembukuan quran hanya siasat bangsa quraisy melalui usman untuk mempertahankan hegemoninya atas masyarakat arab dan islam hegemoni itu tampak jelas terpusat pada ranah kekuasaan agama dan budaya dan hanya orang yang mensakralkan quranlah yang berhasil terperangkap siasat bangsa quraisy tersebut

8151594 jika al quran dipengaruhi budaya yahudi kristen yang sejalan dengan klaim bahwa al quran meneruskan wahyu wahyu sebelumnya maka bahasa aramaik mungkin telah diterjemahkan oleh manusia ke dalam bahasa arab atau salah diterjemahkan dalam kasus hur dan tak ada yang tahu berapa banyak lagi kata yang diterjemahkan secara kurang tepat bagaimana jika semua ayat salah dipahami

8151646 im not sure if its connected to kalma but its related to that the government kills and the international community does not intervene what can the darfurian people do
8151647 food is the latest weapon in their regime change agenda
8151648 they cannot last a day longer if we as zimbabweans speak against them in deafening unison
8151649 regrettably we have noticed the hand of our enemies to thwart us
8151650 food is the latest weapon in their regime change agenda
8151651 the only person who can officially open parliament will be determined by the outcome of the dialogue
8151652 it seems clear that the mpla will retain or increase its majority in parliament
8151653 there is a clear violation of angolan law that prohibits the government from promoting itself through the state owned media
8151654 in the end the mpla will have a lot more airtime than all the other parties as a whole and this will obviously influence the final result of the election
8151655 but the angolan people are smart enough to read between the lines they know that life isnt as pink as what the government portrays on television
8151656 the mpla is using all the government means available including military airplanes helicopters boats and trucks to carry out its propaganda
8151657 on top of that it also uses up most of our time during television and radio newscasts

8151715 they used to take their animals to graze all across the
8151716 we do make a difference but what is needed are fundamental changes such as access to land and access to water
8151717 we never considered that interferon alpha could be a major player in early type 1 diabetes this was a pretty surprising finding
8151718 a normal process programmed cell death causes a normal response but it does this in such a way that in a small subset of the population it starts them on the road to type 1 diabetes
8151719 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8151720 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8151721 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8151722 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8151723 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful
8151724 but they are not effective against global warming and in order to ensure the long term survival of this rich marine community that is what we need to address
8151725 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example
8151726 the language centre of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
8151727 the brain areas that are responsible for language in an adult do not learn how to process language during development but rather they are specialized at least in part to process language from the start

8151731 an appeal to arms and the god of hosts is all that is left us but we shall not fight our battle alone there is a just god that presides over the destinies of nations the battle sir is not of the strong alone is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it almighty god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death
8151732 it cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was founded not by religionists but by christians not on religion but on the gospel of jesus christ for that reason alone people of other faiths have been afforded freedom of worship here
8151733 i am a christian that is to say a disciple of the doctrines of jesus i have little doubt that our whole country will soon be rallied to the unity of our creator and i hope to the pure doctrine of jesus also
8151734 it is impossible to govern the world without god and the bible of all the dispositions and habits that lead to political prosperity our religion and morality are the indispensable supporters let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion reason and experience both forbid us to expect that our national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
8151735 oh eternal and everlasting god direct my thoughts words and work wash away my sins in the immaculate blood of the lamb and purge my heart by the holy spirit daily frame me more and more in the likeness of thy son jesus christ that living in thy fear and dying in thy favor i may in thy appointed time obtain the resurrection of the justified unto eternal life bless o lord the whole race of mankind and let the world be filled with the knowledge of thy son jesus christ
8151736 we have no government armed with the power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and true religion our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other
8151737 providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers and it is the duty as well as the privilege and interest of our christian nation to select and prefer christians for their rulers
8151738 the highest glory of the american revolution was this it connected in one indissoluble bond the principles of civil government with the principles of christianity
8151739 the foundations of our society and our government rest so much on the teachings of the bible that it would be difficult to support them if faith in these teachings would cease to be practically universal in our country
8151740 the congress of the united states recommends and approves the holy bible for use in all schools
8151741 the christian religion is the religion of our country from it are derived our notions on character of god on the great moral governor of the universe on its doctrines are founded the peculiarities of our free institutions gt from no source has the author drawn more conspicuously than from the sacred scriptures from all these extracts from the bible i make no apology
8151742 let every student be plainly instructed and earnestly pressed to consider well the main end of his life and studies is to know god and jesus christ which is eternal life john 17 3 and therefore to lay jesus christ as the only foundation of all sound knowledge and learning and seeing the lord only giveth wisdom let everyone seriously set himself by prayer in secret to seek it of him proverbs 2 3
8151743 almighty god we acknowledge our dependence on thee we beg thy blessings upon us and our parents and our teachers and our country amen
8151744 if portions of the new testament were read without explanation they could and have been psychologically harmful to children
8151745 if the posted copies of the ten commandments were to have any effect at all it would be to induce school children to read them and if they read them meditated upon them and perhaps venerated and observed them this is not a permissible objective
8151746 we have staked the whole future of our new nation not upon the power of government far from it we have staked the future of all our political constitutions upon the capacity of each of ourselves to govern ourselves according to the moral principles of the ten commandments

8151765 we are in a period of significant downturn in consumer demand and this report will come as good news for retailers but with the significant caveat that the rudd government must now act to improve the retail tenancy market nationally
8151766 when other federal governments have ignored the issue as being too hard the new government with its policy of reducing the cost burden of differing state legislations must now act
8151767 we encourage the government to move forward with haste to help retailers with the following issues that must be addressed in any new legislative framework code of conduct to improve operational and negotiation behaviour full disclosure by the landlord of true rent and plans for the shopping centre non disclosure of turnover figures directly to the landlord end of lease negotiation separation of shopping centres from other retail activity and low cost dispute mechanisms
8151768 this report confirms what governments have been told for many many years yet seemingly do not have the courage to resolve that is major shopping centres are a very different retail market compared to strip and small retail sectors these shopping centres operate in a virtual monopoly due to planning laws and therefore have restrictive competition practices within their negotiations with retail tenants
8151769 tenants are at a disadvantage at the negotiation table due to one sided disclosure requirements and this issue can be remedied by simplifying the legislative template nationally and applying a code of conduct
8151770 relax planning and zoning controls that limit competition and restrict retail space and its utilisation

8151785 simpelweg verdient heineken een bedrijfswinst van 400 miljoen euro meer dat is ongeveer netto 300 miljoen euro en daar betaalt ze 4 5 miljard euro voor dat is veel voor een biermarkt die niet echt groeit natuurlijk snap ik dat heineken deze prooi niet kon laten ontsnappen maar de prijs is hoog nee volgens mij ging heineken het ook zonder de s amp n overname al zwaar genoeg krijgen door hogere kosten en een lagere dollar
8151786 ik concludeer dat mijn reserves zelfs zijn toegenomen de koers is sinds de overname in november 2007 werd aangekondigd 35 gedaald dat is veel meer dan van een defensief fonds mag worden verwacht er zit daarom al veel scepsis in de koers maar ik loop nog niet warm eerst de halfjaarcijfers afwachten
8151787 ik wil dat jullie je afvragen of jullie alleen voor mij aan deze campagne deelnamen

8151794 we want to promote better hygiene and the use of several water treatment options to prevent waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea
8151795 there is a need for greater investment in water and sanitation infrastructure and in promoting improved hygiene practices in indonesia because of the impact on health and on the economy
8151796 even though my house is right by a small river filled with rubbish my family and i seldom catch a serious disease
8151797 i think people who live in lavish buildings are more prone to diseases because theyre not used to a dirty environment

8151802 many participants believed that the indaba method while not designed to achieve final decisions was such a necessary aspect of understanding what the questions might be that they expressed a desire to see the method used more widely and to continue among themselves the conversations begun in canterbury
8151803 i shall be seeking to identify the resources we shall need in order to take forward some of the proposals about our structures and methods
8151804 i believe that the conference succeeded in doing this to a very remarkable degree more than most people expected
8151805 at the end of our time together many people especially some of the newer bishops said that they had been surprised by the amount of convergence they had seen and there can be no doubt that practically all who were present sincerely wanted the communion to stay together
8151806 a strong majority of bishops present agreed that moratoria on same sex blessings and on cross provincial interventions were necessary but they were aware of the conscientious difficulties this posed for some and there needs to be a greater clarity about the exact expectations and what can be realistically implemented
8151807 to help churches increase and improve their own capacity to deliver change for the sake of justice
8151808 clear goals for developing environmentally responsible policies in church life
8151809 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
8151810 this report reaffirms our belief that the christian church is a sign of gods love for our world it emphasises the unique value of each young persons life and seeks to inspire the churches to reach out to young people in inner cities caught up in social disorder as an act of good neighbourliness
8151811 this report has a vital and timely message i hope that church leaders will use it to inform the way they work with young people government the police and criminal justice agencies but also step up their efforts to tackle the underlying causes of the alarming trend of rising knife crime
8151812 to be on the lookout for stock piles and caches of supplies that could be used by violent protestors at the up coming democratic national convention
8151813 past practices of demonstrators show that they will use outlying abandoned buildings homes camping facilities secluded woods and farm fields to store their supplies
8151814 be alert for medium and large numbers of these items that seem out of place for its location this could indicate the stock piling of supplies to be used against first responders
8151815 can also be used to throw at first responders and interfere with and horses
8151816 violent protestors are using 1 1 2 inch to 2 inch self tapping screws to secure the handles on these shields
8151817 the screws have been secured to the shields to act as an assault weapon against the officers
8151818 another tactic used by violent protestors is to sharpen the upper edges of the shields and then use them as a slashing weapon against the officers
8151819 heavy wooden handles in 5 foot lengths are perfect for swinging at first responders
8151820 metal posts can also be used to hold improvised tiki torches to deliver flammable liquid on first responders
8151821 can be used in balloons to throw shoot at first responders
8151822 im confident we have everything in place to keep the event secure

8151826 he was very much opposed to separation he saw the methodist societies as within the established church and anything that smacked of separation was something he took a very strong view of
8151827 at one point in the journal he is talking to the society at grimsby and goes into block capitals and says i told them i would remain with them as long as they remained with the church of england but should they ever turn their back on the church they turn their back on me
8151828 he john is insensible of both his own folly and danger and of the divine goodness in so miraculously saving him
8151829 seriously i am willing to and have listened to what you have to say you are talking opinion which i can appreciate and listen to but i have been studying this for quite sometime you are weighing opinion against declassified papers referring to false flag ops which are also fact please prove me wrong i listened to what you had to say so show me w facts where i am wrong
8151830 how many people in the real world do i know that are aware of whats going on

8151835 a week ago it was one thing now she completely changes her mind i think thats just ridiculous
8151836 on august 20th judge hurst correctly decided that she did not have the authority to enjoin this office from implementing the executive order within the executive branch
8151837 this latest decision by judge hurst is not a clarification of that decision it is a complete and outrageous reversal of what she said just last week
8151838 has a constitutional obligation to balance the budget and will take the necessary actions to achieve the cost savings associated with that budget
8151839 to go to the olympics and win so many golds was brilliant all our athletes have made the nation feel great again

8151859 this race is all about the future that is why we must elect barack obama as our next president because the race for the future will be won when old partisanship gives way to new ideas when we put solutions over stalemate and when hope replaces fear
8151860 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8151861 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 men and 15 women
8151862 this matter is of grave concern to the united nations we have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
8151863 with explosions continuing and a fire raging it is quite treacherous for rescuers since there are huge hidden dangers amid the blasts along with leaks of toxic gases such as ammonia and formaldehyde
8151864 we are continuing to collect information through the afghan authorities but his safety has yet to be confirmed
8151865 we will do our best so that mr ito is rescued as soon as possible
8151866 we have strict orders from our higher ups to give no quarter to curfew violators and deal with any violations firmly
8151867 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8151868 it is prudent for the governor general to remain in canada
8151869 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
8151870 there was black smoke everywhere dead bodies on the ground and people panicking and helping to transfer the injured to the hospital
8151871 in three years afghanistan has gone from 82 percent of the provinces growing poppy to approximately 60 percent of the provinces being poppy free
8151872 at this point in time i would like to ask nato and isaf to concentrate on these three very physical targets targets in the hands of either insurgents or criminal groups
8151873 and therefore not attacking the farmers but attacking those who provide the opportunity for farmers to cultivate opium
8151874 we recognize the power museums have to address the solid issues of today and of the past
8151875 we want to help resolve the underlying questions about why these histories have come to exist she explained that the sites of conscience are all significant for their use of physical space to make history come alive and to speak to people today
8151876 our sites are significant because they use the physical space of history to connect to people today
8151877 our sites can reflect upon the past and connect to the future so the same mistakes are not repeated

8151881 i would say some people thought we were going to die the woman sitting in the seat in front of us was whimpering
8151882 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear we really didnt see them during the main situation at all they didnt say anything they werent visible
8151883 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8151884 i was scared i think everyone was scared ive got three kids and my wife on the flight and i just sat there helplessly thinking it might be the end
8151885 i would say the crew didnt know what to do they didnt inform us for about 20 minutes which i think was wrong a little information would have calmed everyone down
8151886 my wifes oxygen bag inflated and so did my sons mine stayed flat all around me people kept tugging and saying its not working properly
8151887 the first thing we do in these situations is take the safety first option we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8151888 they usually inflate when passengers exhale its a trickle of pure oxygen you dont feel a rush of gas all its doing is enriching the low pressure air
8151889 the pilot is having to navigate having to communicate with air traffic control and having to avoid hitting other aeroplanes his priority is to keep the aeroplane safe
8151890 they satisfy every single safety level but it is the minimum
8151891 the commercial goes on to blast the obama children for smiling and giggling but refusing to state their position on offshore oil drilling

8151895 our evidence indicates the earliest inhabitants of palau were of normal stature and it counters the evidence that berger et al presented in their paper indicating there was a reduced stature population in early palau
8151896 our research from whole bones and whole skeletons indicates that the earliest individuals in palau were of normal stature but gracile in other words they were thin
8151897 i think bergers primary mistakes were his not understanding the variation in the skeletal population in which he was working
8151898 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8151899 this is a fight for the future and it is a fight we must win together

8152002 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8152003 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8152004 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8152005 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats

8152012 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

8152015 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8152016 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8152017 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8152018 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8152019 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

8152041 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8152042 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8152043 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8152044 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8152045 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8152046 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8152047 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8152048 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8152049 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8152050 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8152051 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8152052 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8152053 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8152054 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8152055 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8152056 han pasado los a os suficientes como para que la sociedad chilena pueda tener una visi n m s exacta de un hecho tan notable en la historia de chile el golpe de estado y por ello se le recuerda o conmemora en los medios
8152057 pienso que poco a poco este pa s va logrando los espacios de libertad para que se conozca la verdad
8152058 en chile las pautas de los medios y el tratamiento de las noticias tienden a ser muy homog neos y eso reviste un serio peligro de generar saturaci n cosa que de hecho tal vez ya est ocurriendo
8152059 lo importante para evitar ese fen meno es que los medios asuman el desaf o de ser creativos y de responder a las necesidades informativas de su p blico adem s de ponderar las dosis de informaci n que ese p blico es capaz de tolerar incluso de un suceso tan trascendente como fue el golpe
8152060 ha permitido que la gente tenga una informaci n m s completa particularmente las nuevas generaciones
8152061 hay que entender que m s de 60 por ciento de la poblaci n de chile tiene menos de 30 a os por lo tanto no vivi el golpe y a lo mejor esa sobresaturaci n es una compensaci n por todo lo que no se habl ni explic durante 17 a os de administraci n militar en la cual s lo se escuchaba una voz
8152062 si bien ha habido una sobrecarga del tema del golpe de 1973 en los medios pienso que por razones hist ricas por razones de tiempo es importante mirar hacia atr s
8152063 el tema no va a morir porque s va a salir por una u otra raz n porque alguien fue detenido porque alguien fue acusado por un nuevo elemento surgido porque alguien decidi hablar sobre los cr menes represivos pero probablemente a los 40 a los 50 a os del golpe no va a volver a haber una implosi n como la hubo ahora
8152064 hace cinco a os no hab a posibilidad de verdad y justicia sobre las violaciones de derechos humanos hoy d a este pa s est comenzando a tener esa posibilidad
8152065 hoy todos reconocen que hubo atropellos a los derechos humanos
8152066 hoy muchos militares est n siendo procesados incluso muchos l deres de opini n m s vinculados a la izquierda est n reconociendo que tuvieron responsabilidad en la polarizaci n que se produjo hace 30 a os en el pa s y que llev al golpe
8152067 su conducta no s lo es indigna sino que es rayana con la traici n
8152068 el mar no tienen buques argentinos por el cielo todos pueden volar menos nuestra fuerza a rea por tierra ya no hay seguridad y por si no bastara con desarmar las fuerzas de la naci n tambi n a los civiles quieren desarmar para que no haya un solo patriota que pueda su arma disparar
8152069 i have been involved in sports for a very long time being a sports official
8152070 i used to be in charge of snooker later after the cricket association was established i got to know more and more about cricket and began to like it more and more so i changed from snooker to cricket
8152071 i think that cricket in china is already moving ahead
8152072 they have 140 level one coaches and umpires now theyve achieved that in the period since 2005 that is indeed very noteworthy
8152073 the icc has believed for quite some time that there is a real opportunity for cricket in china and one of our projects is to explore the possibility of cricket becoming very large in this country
8152074 china has such a strategic approach to everything they wont be benchmarking against some atoll in the pacific
8152075 they will be saying what is the world standard and trying to better it seeking prominence and world recognition
8152076 the icc came to us and said they had a very charming game which could be introduced to china and at that time the then vice president and secretary general of the cca paid a visit to hong kong to observe the hong kong international sixes
8152077 we found that cricket is a very good for chinese people because it emphasises hand eye co ordination
8152078 now what we need to do urgently is improve our high performance
8152079 there is a possibility that tata may need to shoulder some of these costs
8152080 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8152081 youll be part of a legal protest that may someday be covered in the history books
8152082 sen clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8152083 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8152084 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8152085 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8152086 its right along their theme of trying to put president bush and john mccain together which of course john mccain has made such a point of being an independent
8152087 that is one of the great things about him he really calls his own shots and he agrees when he really does and hes willing to disgree if he doesnt
8152088 the democratic party seems to be two democratic parties the party of hillary rodham clinton and the party of barack obama
8152089 the main thing is the fact is barack obama hasnt put the party together yet and were looking at september 1
8152090 this was her time to make her case for barack obama
8152091 it validated the argument that she made and that were making choose experience with john mccain or choose an inexperienced rookie to put in the white house
8152092 hes a charming guy hes a celebrity but does he have the judgment and experience that comes from a life long service in one sector or another
8152093 the normal political thing to do in terms of the best decision to make to win wouldve been to pick hillary clinton
8152094 it is a no brainer she got 18 million votes joe got 9 000 votes
8152095 thats what the choice for a president comes down to it doesnt come down to a choice between the abstract and the abstract it comes down to a choice between two people
8152096 you cant avoid that comparison youve got one candidate with a lot of experience and one with virtually no experience
8152097 i cant imagine anybody who is ready to debate joe biden
8152098 im not sure when john mccain will make his vice president announcement or who itll be
8152099 i have confidence in his instincts hes proven time and time again that those instincts serve him well and i think hell make a wise choice
8152100 you have mixed news here mirroring the mixed news in the economy last year
8152101 but i think it is quite reasonable to say 2007 was a peak year and still median income is slightly below the 2000 level poverty is higher and child poverty is way up you have a cycle here that was very sluggish
8152102 if we continue to turn a blind eye to the growing income gap between the very rich and the rest of us well find ourselves in a country with no middle class
8152103 bridging our countrys troubling income gap starts with universal health care because working families will never get ahead if they continue to be held back by medical bills and insurance premiums they cant afford to pay
8152104 programs like schip and medicaid are lifelines for providing americans with the health care they need especially during times when the economy is soft and more people feel vulnerable to losing employer sponsored health insurance
8152105 unfortunately were still seeing an unraveling of the private insurance system
8152106 after it gets into the gulf it has the potential to go anywhere
8152107 if this storm continues to come this way ill be changing my travel plans

8152122 the total event prize money of 400 000 dollars will now be paid into the atp player pension fund
8152123 we are looking at developed countries like hong kong and singapore where their property markets are quite saturated and property values are higher
8152124 we will promote beachfront projects to countries in the middle east like the united arab emirates

8152132 i think network is going to take a page from the cablers and start developing scripted for summer as well
8152133 i dont think they will be able to get along over the next several years without going toe to toe with us in the summer

8152142 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come
8152143 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life

8152206 a contact with excellent access who does not have an established reporting record
8152207 this unremarkable report was disseminated but because it produced no solid answers there wasnt any urgency to brief its results to senior officials such as the vice president

8152222 one of my teachers at middle school i cant remember his name said i would never be successful when someone says that im going to work even harder to prove him wrong it was a dream come true to achieve something no one has done before
8152223 i am 23 now and if i went out with a girl she wouldnt see much of me until i get past 30
8152224 my main aim in life is to swim faster i am going to do even better things in london in four years time
8152225 id like a home draw so our fans can see us play
8152226 coventry beat united last year then played west ham we had a good cup run and generated a hell of a lot of money at the same time
8152227 the fans that paid to come here tonight will have been very pleased with how emmanuel played
8152228 he is a very gifted kid he pops up in areas that can hurt people he has a decent left peg and he likes shooting when he has a chance
8152229 but he is still learning his trade and my only concern is that it might turn out to be a long arduous season for him
8152230 gary was hauled to the floor but you either get them or you dont
8152231 the referee said no and we had to get on with it
8152232 we knew they were a good team but we thought if we could pinch a goal we could cause them problems and up until half time we gave a good account of ourselves
8152233 but that changed totally in the second half and they have given us a tanking
8152234 it will be a long journey home but the better team deserved to win and it is no disgrace to be beaten by a side like that
8152235 warning you will be ganked all the time and it will be very difficult to get anything done this server is not recommended
8152236 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8152237 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8152238 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8152239 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8152240 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8152241 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8152242 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8152243 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8152244 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8152245 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8152246 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8152247 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8152248 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8152249 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8152250 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8152251 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8152252 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8152253 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8152254 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8152255 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8152256 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8152257 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8152258 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8152259 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8152260 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8152261 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8152262 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8152263 depkeu juga sudah sudah menyiapkan untuk kita alokasinya itu rp 4 8 triliun untuk 3 tahun sekarang kita teken kontrak sama investor jadi kalau harga tanah melebihi sekian itu akan ditanggung oleh pemerintah itu akan dibebankan jadi ada land capping dan alokasinya sudah ada untuk departemen pu
8152264 ini diperlukan saat kita mengerjakan jorr jorr itu itu biasnya kenaikan harganya melebihi yang ditetapkan sehingga perlu ditutupi dengan land capping
8152265 sekarang tinggal isu ke depan apakah tetap di bi atau di swasta opti opsi itu masih terus kita pelajari
8152266 cuma saya katakan plus minusnya ada misalnya kalau di swasta jadi komersial tiap mau nanya bayar kalau sekarang gratis tidak bayar
8152267 tergantung situasi indonesia secara finansial apakah sudah maju jadi kita akan bekerjasama dengan bi untuk mencari bentuk yang paling pas
8152268 dari keterbukaan informasi yang mereka berikan belum mencukupi mereka hanya memberitahu perusahaannya dibeli penton international tapi tidak memberikan kejelasan siapa penton itu dan perusahaannya apa
8152269 jadi kita belum bisa buka suspensinya karena kita ingin menyampaikan bahwa kita tidak main main dengan masuk pasar modal lalu bisa melakukan aksi tanpa kejelasan
8152270 sekali lagi saya tekankan kita tidak mau masalah ini jadikan kesempatan untuk mengambil untung oleh kontraktor dan pengusaha
8152271 kita akan lihat bukti buktinya kalau ada kenaikan yang luar biasa pemerintah tidak akan tinggal diam
8152272 kalau mereka dirugikan kita juga tidak mau karena pengusaha tersebut juga salah satu faktor yang ikut membangun bangsa kita kalau dia rugi dan jatuh karena kebijakan pemerintah kita tidak inginkan tetapi pemerintah harus hati hati jangan sampai kita dipermainkan pengusaha
8152273 belum ada yang saya bisa komentari kalau benar ya kita siap beri jawaban
8152274 siapa yang bilang dirumahkan jangan asal komentar kalau tidak tahu kondisi sebenarnya kata awang
8152275 intinya kita tidak ingin kpc sebagai aset negara terdapat perbuatan melanggar hukum yang bisa berimbas buruk di kemudian hari

8152287 i did see senator mccain has spoken out about being open
8152288 but i need to speak to him and his staff to get fully briefed about his posture
8152289 something that should be a process of extensive negotiation with a recognition that government should not bail everybody out but if government is going to be involved that it be something that involves all the parties and there be giving from all the parties involved
8152290 truth is one of the first casualties of the obama new politics campaign

8152293 im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
8152294 did ronald reagan seem less down to earth because he was inspiring in his speeches was john kennedy less down to earth because he asked us to put our country ahead of ourselves
8152295 there arent a lot of people in public life who do this personally
8152296 when you live in the world of words specific words are important
8152297 the impact of his words is so strong because they are so personal
8152298 one people all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes
8152299 in no other country on earth is my story even possible
8152300 he doesnt make jokes theres no sense of bounce there
8152301 embodies what americans would like to believe is best about their country his message is not a scolding message its a hopeful message he reeks hope
8152302 he is very good at analyzing a situation and making a concise and accessible argument
8152303 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
8152304 you can trust our guy because hes not eloquent enough to mislead you
8152305 his ability to inspire people through his speeches has put a much sharper focus on mccains inability to do that
8152306 he didnt want to be in a convention hall with just the elected delegates he wants to speak to the country
8152307 will require a u s occupation of undetermined length at undetermined cost with undetermined consequences
8152308 could possibly make him unelectable in a general election but he felt very strongly

8152326 i had been on the news condemning the attacks on police officers
8152327 there is no doubt in my mind that it was specifically me who was attacked and targeted because they waited until i had walked away until i came under attack
8152328 however police will continue in their efforts to bring calm to the area despite these attacks on them
8152329 i would appeal to everyone involved in the trouble to stop it now before someone is either injured or killed
8152330 im just trying to finish this season strong and hopefully get in the playoffs im 0 0 in my mind after every start i try to go out there and not really pay attention to that

8152346 browse is big and costly and has higher co2 content than our other projects
8152347 of all of our lng portfolio it is also the project that will be the most adversely affected by an unfavourable emissions trading scheme
8152348 and if we dont get that it will impact the ability of this project to move forward
8152349 if the current discussion paper is not corrected well need to consider dramatically reducing the spending that we have going in 2009 and beyond
8152350 without fundamental re working of the ets it would be hard to justify substantial expenditure on browse
8152351 pluto is probably the best in terms of the impact of the ets
8152352 pluto train 2 could move ahead of sunrise and browse
8152353 we cannot execute three mega projects at the same time

8152358 i was in a private area in the parents room behind the curtain and this cleaner just walked in on me and watched what i was doing
8152359 she told me the parents room was for parents and breastfeeding only and that i wasnt allowed to eat lunch in there
8152360 they told me that a little kid had been running around in the parents room and had briefly seen what i was doing and had complained to its mum she said
8152361 the mum then complained to security and the cleaner came in to inspect what i was doing they told me the complaint was that there was a topless woman eating her lunch in the parents room
8152362 its tough enough that i have to do this during my break but for a complaint to be made about me doing it is really upsetting
8152363 theres a public ignorance and theres still a lack of knowledge around breastfeeding and how it works she said
8152364 this mother was very humiliated and something like this could have seen the end of her expressing milk or working
8152365 its already very stressful and then to have someone complain about it is absolutely traumatising

8152375 se est realizando todo lo humanamente posible para concretar la obra para el 15 de octubre tal como es el deseo del ejecutivo nacional sin embargo los aspectos climatol gicos inevitablemente influyen en la labor y cada d a de lluvia es un d a m s que se le agrega al proyecto

8152383 en el estado amazonas nos reunimos con las organizaciones no gubernamentales ambientalistas que se encuentran en el lugar con los organismos del estado con los chamanes y con los voceros de las comunidades ind genas todas sus propuestas las estamos procesando en la comisi n permanente de ambiente
8152384 aprovecho la oportunidad para hacerle un llamado a las autoridades del ministerio del poder popular para el ambiente para que redacten los reglamentos necesarios para que todos estos instrumentos de ley puedan ser aplicados de manera r pida y efectiva
8152385 cabe destacar que hemos recibido una solicitud por parte de la ministra del ambiente yubir ortega para que di ramos un plazo m s y abri ramos un par ntesis en la discusi n en plenaria con el fin de que dicho instrumento siga siendo mucho m s enriquecido
8152386 los sectores consultados insisten sobre todo en los tratamientos en el rea natural y fuera del rea natural como el jard n bot nico ya hemos tomado debida nota de todo ello
8152387 ahora las leyes sobre el ambiente involucran a todos los organismos del estado que tienen que ver con la materia de desastres adem s abordan temas como salud educaci n infraestructura comunicaciones y alimentaci n es decir todos los temas que tienen que ver de manera directa con un momento de desastre
8152388 a nuestra comisi n llegan cerca de 50 casos semanales sobre gestiones y asuntos que no se ventilan en las regiones todas las denuncias son procesadas a trav s de las subcomisiones no s lo las recibimos y analizamos sino que en la mayor a de los casos nos trasladamos al lugar

8152390 once again nice has shown how poorly it assesses new cancer treatments its economic formulae are simply not suitable for addressing cost effectiveness in this area of medicine mean survivals obscure the fact that some patients will obtain prolonged benefit from these drugs
8152391 it is essential that nice gets its sums right we have already seen distraught patients remortgaging their houses giving up pensions and selling cars simply to buy drugs that are freely available to those using health services in countries of comparable wealth
8152392 it just cant be that everybody else around the world is wrong about access to innovative cancer care and the nhs right in rationing it so severely
8152393 there is a finite pot of money for the nhs which is determined annually by parliament
8152394 im anticipating that that i will be in a position to announce a schedule within two weeks and i anticipate that schedule will be very attractive to the industry and the public alike
8152395 when that schedule is announced it will only include events that have been papered as they say which means i will either have a sanctioning agreement or a letter of intent
8152396 because this situation is so fluid and so volatile i think that people need a little more assurance than a handshake i dont need it these are my friends i trust them and a handshake is fine for me but on the other hand i think that as we stand up and claim to be doing this and doing that and doing the other thing we need to make sure that those who are doubting thomass can be reassured the proper way
8152397 i would say that its not inconceivable that there will be a detail change or two but there certainly will not be any conceptual changes
8152398 when we asked the four japanese manufacturers if they had an interest in supporting the factory superbike concept and only one replied that would indicate to me that three had no interest
8152399 now that we have announced our plans for the doubleheaders for american superbike and daytona superbike ive had other manufacturers call me asking for details regarding the weekend schedule and how many riders they needed to hire weve sent rfps request for proposals to the tire companies telling them how many races were going to run and the length of the races
8152400 for me to make a major change at this point would not only be difficult but of course this whole thing has been difficult but it would also then in some ways betray those who when they heard what we intended to do decided to come aboard so i dont believe it makes sense for us to make significant changes
8152401 the next step as i understand it is for me to strike individual deals that are agreeable to each promoter
8152402 while i met with them as a group each of them has their own deal ok
8152403 once we have a schedule announced then im capable of signing my tv contract

8152405 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
8152406 contrary to the commercial approach that is prevalent in the world drug markets our approach towards the production and export of drugs is humane

8152417 i couldnt get ahead my curveball and changeup werent really there overall not a very good night

8152421 that was a very good inning against a guy who looks like hes on his way to the cy young

8152425 here you cant go five or 10 games without a point without anyone noticing and there you can go under the radar a little bit
8152426 thats one thing that i think is going to benefit not just myself but this team i think you are under the gun here and under the pressure of having to perform
8152427 obviously im well aware i wasnt the most popular pickup in calgary flame history but at the same time i think youve got to give it a little time and give me a chance
8152428 i cant lie to you its not the jersey i thought i was going to wear but at the same time i played enough games here to know what kind of fan base and what kind of team they are
8152429 in anaheim i thought it was going to be a good opportunity but i just didnt fit into the mode there with ice time playing 10 to 12 minutes a game its kind of hard to perform
8152430 we were over there and they were taking pictures and the only time ive seen this was in l a when we got on a red carpet once in a while not at the rink
8152431 i said to todd does this remind you of vancouver a little bit he said yeah here we go again
8152432 i havent played a home game on canadian soil since i was 16 years old so i think the whole idea of canadians knowledge of the game their love their passion for the sport is how i grew up
8152433 im just gonna come in and put myself in a good position to be successful with my conditioning this team has been there right from the past five six seven years
8152434 will parliament function normally this fall where the government is the government and the opposition is the opposition anarchy or where the opposition is the bartolucci weighs in on legacy

8152443 well keep doing it until we find the right way we cant get too down we still have another game here and more than a month left to go in the season

8152450 he said he is feeling better and is ready to go home
8152451 he was not totally unconscious but it was hurting him he was moving his arms when they took him away on the stretcher
8152452 a witness near him saw what he believed was a spark of electricity between him and the tool he was reaching for
8152453 a few guys saw it but im not sure if it hit him or right beside him
8152454 one of the guys said it hit the top of his head but i didnt see his shoes messed up
8152455 i knew it hit somewhere i could tell it was close then everybody started yelling and i ran over there
8152456 part of the roof was knocked off and it landed on braniff road and knocked down some power lines
8152457 the computer models are all over the place right now
8152458 its too early to theorize on galveston the potential is there but its too early to narrow down where it might go
8152459 how long do you have to masterplan before you actually do anything
8152460 if the coalition was in power today not one single bed would have been provided in townsville not one extra bed and they stand here and criticise us
8152461 what we are about is giving aramac a future in terms of its health services
8152462 what was the admission rate over the last 12 months at aramac hospital i believe if im right they had 12 overnight admissions thats one a month
8152463 we are investing in more beds now before the new university hospital comes on line so we are meeting and recognising the growth pressures that are occurring on the sunshine coast
8152464 were not set up to go out and do the great big fight in one night it takes us several nights to go out and catch up

8152469 i was talking to my sister districts and theyre all scrambling too trying to catch up with these things hopefully by the weekend it will be better i wont say theyll be gone but hopefully theyll be better
8152470 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8152471 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8152472 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
8152473 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
8152474 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
8152475 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
8152476 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
8152477 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
8152478 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
8152479 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
8152480 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
8152481 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
8152482 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
8152483 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
8152484 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
8152485 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
8152486 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
8152487 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
8152488 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8152489 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle
8152490 we have an obligation to defend ourselves against competitors who choose to engage in fraudulent activities against us
8152491 the british seem to like to laugh about their stupidity in a funny way
8152492 during the performance when the london bus pulled over all the passengers waiting for the bus rushed into the door at the same time which truly damaged the british image
8152493 unfortunately the singer and jimmy page are absolutely not famous enough to be known or recognised by millions of the chinese audiences as for david beckham he was supposed to kick the football towards the red circle in the centre of the birds nest in the end just like any of his penalties at a football match he totally missed it he kicked the ball to the left and dropped in the crowd then was picked up by a lucky chinese volunteer who would not let go of the ball
8152494 mohammed was a young student who was loved by his family friends and teachers he was a charming lovely boy and there is nothing that can replace our loss justice has to be done in this investigation all of those involved in committing this crime on a young innocent 16 year old boy should be punished
8152495 we cannot believe something like this could happen we will never come back here
8152496 i asked them to keep an eye on the boys and they said they would then left
8152497 less than an hour later mohammed had been beaten to death there are no words that can describe the horror of what happened the attack seemed unprovoked and without reason
8152498 mohammed i believe was trying to make his way away from the incident and has fallen and struck his head on the pavement we need to try to find the exact circumstances of how this came to be clearly much of the investigation will seek to establish to what extent race played a part in what happened to mohammed
8152499 i would say some people thought we were going to die that is how frightening it was
8152500 the woman sitting in the seats in front of us was whimpering
8152501 there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft
8152502 the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping my highest priority was to get a mask on my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state
8152503 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons
8152504 he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
8152505 from where i was sitting i could see about 20 masks and only a few of them were inflating it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8152506 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
8152507 the first thing we do in these situations is divert to safety
8152508 the crew cant be making passenger pa announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8152509 as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8 000ft where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off
8152510 lucentis is an expensive drug costing more than 10 000 for each eye treated
8152511 but that cost needs to be balanced against the likely cost savings
8152512 it has been estimated that the costs related to sight impairment for patients treated with lucentis are around 8 000 cheaper than for patients who receive best supportive care over a 10 year period
8152513 our guidance means that patients who are suitable for this treatment will have the same access to it irrespective of where they live
8152514 it is a victory for thousands bringing overwhelming relief to desperate people across the country
8152515 finally the torment faced by elderly people forced to either spend their life savings on private treatment or go blind is over
8152516 nices guidance will finally bring an end to a cruel postcode lottery
8152517 we are very pleased and relieved that nice has issued this long awaited final guidance
8152518 thousands of patients with the wet type of macular degeneration who are at grave risk of losing their precious remaining sight quite suddenly have prayed for this day to arrive that day is finally here
8152519 many hundreds of vulnerable patients have been subjected to an appalling emotional rollercoaster ride for the past two years during which many of them have lost their remaining sight
8152520 the reimbursement scheme is an innovative approach which shows how pharmaceutical companies can work together with nice and the department of health to ensure patients do get access to treatments on the nhs
8152521 this is the first step in an improvement in housing there are some signs the worst has passed us and thats the best we could say for now
8152522 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level depending on where you focus you can see some different stories on where home prices are headed
8152523 it is true to say it is dependent on carzola being signed but that is looking very positive at this time he wants to go to real madrid and robinho wants to come to chelsea and i think it will now happen although things can change very quickly
8152524 now i have returned home we will not look back anymore but forwards
8152525 i will give anything to score immediately i want to start again i hope that the injuries i had in recent seasons wont be repeated but here i have everything i need to do well and it depends only on me
8152526 i always felt really good whenever that match happened i hope that it can still be like that
8152527 how will you make sure that you will fill it with the most fun and that you visit all the coolest places on earth before you pack those bags for the very last time
8152528 tribesmen climb up homemade towers its sort of like the original bungee jumping
8152529 at the stroke of midnight they light them all on fire in a huge loud pyromania sic display
8152530 the books title meant you should live every day like it would be your last and theres not that many people who do
8152531 its a credit to dave he didnt have enough days but he lived them like he should have
8152532 were going to the future do you want to come along
8152533 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchase which have fallen by some two thirds over the last year levelled off in july
8152534 it would however be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low the pressures on household budgets are reflected in the relatively weak rise in individuals deposits and with consumer borrowing growing only slowly it seems that consumers are acting prudently
8152535 this still leaves approvals at a record low down around 70 per cent from the peak in late 2006
8152536 but the bba data for july offers some evidence that a bottom is appearing in the market after the extraordinary slide in activity
8152537 we continue to anticipate a modest recovery in house purchase activity in the second half but the still very low level of approvals points to falling house prices we currently expect an 18 per cent drop by year end and a further 9 per cent decline by the end of 2009
8152538 the shortage of mortgage funding is creating similar problems for buy to let landlords as it is for other borrowers however we expect the rental market to remain underpinned by strong demand partly because some people who would like to buy a home are being forced to carry on renting for now
8152539 savvy investors are waiting until the bottom of the market has been reached before extending their portfolios i would expect to see an increase in activity again towards the end of next year when they feel there are bargains to be had
8152540 we first recommended batm at 35p in february this year with a price target of 60p given these strong half year earnings and developments into new geographical markets eastern europe and new verticals medical and security we raise our 12 month price target from 60p to 80p based on an increase in full year eps estimate from 3p to 4p
8152541 at 56p the stock trades at 11 9 times our 2008 earnings per share before amortisation of acquired intangibles this represents a c50 per cent discount to arm and a c30 per cent discount to spirent
8152542 my superiors were not happy the local bishop was not happy but they did not understand me either
8152543 it was not at all my intention to put nuns on the catwalk
8152544 it was interpreted as more of a physical thing now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete
8152545 we have to draw more attention to the world of nuns who are often not sufficiently appreciated by society
8152546 many monasteries in italy are dying because of a lack of religious vocations
8152547 the group has taken decisive action in response to the toughest period of trading it has experienced in its time as a public company
8152548 foreseeable future with continued poor mortgage liquidity limiting housing market activity
8152549 you cant get a mortgage to support your transaction you are not going to get off the starting blocks
8152550 we think best buy of all consumer electronics retailers is best placed to judge that the industry has moved on it doesnt need to acquire extensive underperforming store chains when an increasing amount of demand is moving online
8152551 from a technical analysis perspective in the short term i think the ftse will trade in the 5 300 5 500 range
8152552 after the recent share price rally the stock is trading well above our reduced target price of 212p thus we reduce our rating to sell
8152553 we believe that given good relations between the indian and russian governments any necessary approvals ought to be granted
8152554 given the possibility of ongc coming to the market to acquire imperial shares and the possibility of a counter bid from sinopec which could potentially see ongc increase its offer to 1 500p
8152555 asda has even run out of toy gold medals as youngsters up and down the uk are inspired to recreate the team gbs olympic glory
8152556 we saw growing interest in mobile access to the internet as people wanted to stay constantly in touch with results and the medal table
8152557 were excited about the prospects for 2012 obviously because of the location and the feelgood factor it will bring but also because of viewing times
8152558 we expect the 2012 olympics to have a huge impact on the amount of people getting interested in sports and sports nutrition to improve performance our fully trained store associates will all be providing customers with information on the supplements they need to perform for their chosen sport whether it is their daily jog around the park or a more intensive fitness programme
8152559 we find that most sporting events have an effect on sales at comet
8152560 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year
8152561 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
8152562 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together
8152563 we dont have numbers but we know it is happening people are abandoning their fields of agave and flipping over to other crops
8152564 because of the slow growth rate of agave it is especially sensitive to the boom and bust agricultural cycle only played out in a slightly longer cycle
8152565 you tend an agave for six years and then the price drops on you or you get hit with a freeze or something its a lot of investment to lose
8152566 this would principally affect low quality tequila which will be altered so that it contains a lower percentage of agave
8152567 if people get more money for other crops they will stop growing agave and the price will rise its basic economics
8152568 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again
8152569 we dont count by days we count by hours we think by tomorrow it will be finished
8152570 i wont yield my cabinet wont yield the military and the police wont yield
8152571 i wont leave until there is a political change if you want me to leave you will have to kill me and take my body out of here
8152572 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8152573 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8152574 if we stay disciplined defensively and capitalize on our offensive options we will have success
8152575 we have respect towards them because they are here for the same reason we are
8152576 the first game is perhaps the most important because if you win you put pressure on the other team during the second game

8152616 in the middle ages uninformed and inadequate theories about embryology led some theologians to speculate that specifically human life capable of receiving an immortal soul may not exist until a few weeks into pregnancy
8152617 these mistaken biological theories became obsolete over 150 years ago when scientists discovered that a new human individual comes into being from the union of sperm and egg at fertilization in keeping with this modern understanding the church teaches that from the time of conception fertilization each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with respect for the fundamental right to life
8152618 lets hope pelosi talks some more about her views on church teaching

8152621 real change that you could believe in would be an end to empire and an end to wars for corporate greed not just the change of the shade of the political managers
8152622 there was a failure of the master to exercise extraordinary diligence and good seamanship thereby committing an error of judgment

8152624 a concert of this nature is not conducive to teach the younger generation to become good citizens upright and competitive but instead would weaken them morally and mentally

8152626 these are people who are used to a tough life but they are now on the edge

8152628 they used to take their animals to graze all across the west bank and even into jordan

8152632 i am confident that this groups efforts will help the university address this important set of issues in a constructive spirit and forthright manner
8152633 i had been on the news condemning the attacks on police officers
8152634 there is no doubt in my mind that it was specifically me who was attacked and targeted because they waited until i had walked away until i came under attack
8152635 however police will continue in their efforts to bring calm to the area despite these attacks on them
8152636 i would appeal to everyone involved in the trouble to stop it now before someone is either injured or killed
8152637 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8152638 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8152639 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8152640 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8152641 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8152642 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8152643 presidents like to take credit when things go well and therefore they should get the blame when things dont go well but there are lots of things driving this not all of which are home grown
8152644 the oil shocks are not and globalization which on balance is good for the country leaves winners and losers
8152645 private insurance has been falling and public insurance definitely went up
8152646 the number of uninsured is considerably higher than when the president took office and in each year since then employer sponsored insurance has continued to diminish
8152647 i think its more like we are seeing a tide that i dont think anybody can easily fix particularly in the small business sector
8152648 we have things that we want to work on but we also have to be smart about protecting our players were going to need them for the opener
8152649 you have to be smart but you also have to make sure that you have enough guys to finish the game if a few get banged up
8152650 its a fine edged sword when it comes to getting players ready
8152651 you want to get them in game shape but a sprained ankle here or there and a guy is out for three weeks you have to find the right mix
8152652 theres no question that i dont want to play danny the whole way
8152653 we dont need to just try to run the ball we need to see who can actually do it
8152654 there are going to be guys in there competing for jobs
8152655 we have to make sure that we know who we can trust
8152656 new lawsuit within the same jurisdiction based on the same facts or bring this same issues forward
8152657 attorneys for both parties asked for the lawsuits to be dismissed but they would not give any details of how the claims were resolved
8152658 the lawsuits claimed that three of the quilters annie mae young lucinda pettway franklin and loretta pettway were cheated financially by atlanta art dealer william arnett his sons paul and matt arnett and tinwood ventures of atlanta
8152659 all of the follows family and close friends have been contacted weve filed a missing persons report and have reached out to the australian consulate for guidance
8152660 we should disclose that the band has been going through some hard times recently both as a band and as individuals
8152661 working on the new record was the final breaking point for an already unstable band
8152662 jak is here with me now and weve gone over everything to the point of exhaustion jak and i wanted to thank you all for your messages
8152663 its been a fantastic relationship and they will still be involved in advertising in some way but they have decided to end their presenting sponsorship with the pistons
8152664 the details of our future arrangement are still being worked out
8152665 i was hired to do a job to build a program and our goal is to build a top 10 program
8152666 people have said i tried to change the culture and tradition and its just the opposite weve tried to do everything we can to embrace it but we gotta do our own methods the best piece of advice i got was whatever you do be yourself if youre not youre being fake
8152667 ive never been pushed like this before in my life
8152668 i was kind of excited to see what coach rod was gonna bring and im liking everything about it oh hell let you know when something aint right he doesnt really pat you on the back a lot he tries to get you pumped up every day because he knows its gonna be hard
8152669 its always tough in transitions but on the football side nothing caught me off guard
8152670 weve got inexperience and other issues but im encouraged because i think we got the base of the program put in the toughest part was all the drama i didnt let it take away from my current job but i didnt get to enjoy this process as much as you normally would
8152671 im the same guy that a year ago everybodys happy about
8152672 but all of a sudden i change jobs and i become somebody different that was kind of crazy
8152673 just a totally ridiculous statement from someone that had no idea what they were talking about thats not who we are thats not who i am
8152674 people say the fans dont have much patience but i got less patience than anybody
8152675 i have an idea how good well be but there are more question marks everybody has their own style some coaches are ceo types and thats very effective i like to get in the middle of a lot of stuff because i love coaching and i love football
8152676 i still dont know how its going to feel swinging
8152677 im being a little tentative to do so im going to give it a couple more days its definitely taken some good steps forward in the past week a lot less pain in the last week
8152678 if it means it changes a home run ive given up to a double
8152679 i dont care how long it takes to get it right
8152680 they dont ask for my input so whatever they want to do is fine by me
8152681 what i hear and i wont say what umpiring crew told me
8152682 is that the shortest time its taken to do this in dry runs is seven minutes
8152683 thats from the time of the umpire leaving the field to the umpire getting back to the field
8152684 if thats how long its going to take it will crush the game
8152685 people come to games to see the human interaction i like traditional baseball to me this takes away from that and where does it stop thats what i want to know before long itll be balls and strikes plays at the plate plays at first third and second everything i dont agree with it
8152686 there are those who believe it might even shorten the game
8152687 like everything else in life there are times you have to make an adjustment
8152688 calling home runs is now more difficult than it once was because of the configuration of new ballparks
8152689 but anytime you try to change anything in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8152690 i thought the game was pretty solid as it was and as it has been the last 100 years
8152691 our defense got three extra outs which was nice because it gave dallas another inning
8152692 he got a whole innings worth of outs on the bases it was a heck of a job by him and the defense
8152693 as a staff we really try to stress that and give us every opportunity to get outs any way we can
8152694 as a guy whos not going to light up the radar gun you look for outs in other ways when youre struggling or even when youre going good one of the facets of my game i like to practice is controlling the running game and giving zuke a chance to throw a guy out when he does decide to take off

8152696 through the eyes of others african americans and identity in american art
8152697 offers insights into the ways that americans in the past viewed one another how artistic representations of black people created and reinforced popular attitudes and how these attitudes continue to affect us today this is not simply a story for african americans but for all of us because the issues represented in this exhibition identity self portrayal survival resistance and stereotyping are issues that relate to each individual who has ever wondered about their own identity and to every group that has entered this country
8152698 this is a significant racketeering case involving alleged criminal activity spanning the globe
8152699 we have good friendly banter between both clubs but to me this is not making for good relations and is going to put ipswich fans backs up towards norwich fans and it does not need to be like that
8152700 we have no problem with the principle of local radio stations broadcasting commentary of their local teams matches to that teams traditional catchment area
8152701 the essence of the agreement with the football league is to allow radio stations to broadcast commentary to areas local to clubs it is not as we understand it intended to allow clubs to broadcast to entire regions
8152702 santa barbara is a symbol for the country and the world on the dangers that can occur with offshore oil drilling
8152703 the problem is were addicted to oil and this addiction is slowly poisoning us all more pollution more global warming and more economic instability
8152704 more oil is not the answer it is the problem
8152705 i dont believe a spill of that magnitude could occur
8152706 you want to finish as high as you can that goes along with winning as many games as you can that old stuff about if you dont finish first it doesnt matter i dont buy that hopefully those who do arent in our clubhouse
8152707 this guy went back to the minors last year worked his butt off did what he had to do and here he is i hope he wins the cy young
8152708 pretty much all year long it looks like we might get something going then we get into these funks where we just look terrible
8152709 its hard to explain were too good to play the way we have
8152710 that cant happen at triple a that cant happen especially here
8152711 but we didnt help him much it should not have been as bad as it looked
8152712 its about as dangerous as it can get when a mother sets up her own child for this
8152713 all of this is fantasy it was chat room stuff

8152732 i was talking to one of my guys and he said let him paint his own picture you have to find a way to separate your emotions because thats what hes trying to do give him some rope and let him go out and pitch
8152733 it was a struggle with my control the first few innings
8152734 i felt like the mound was a little high but i made good pitches after the second inning i didnt lose my concentration i just tried to make good pitches and get some ground balls
8152735 he was his own worst enemy getting behind and walking some guys
8152736 particularly to left handed hitters tonight he had trouble throwing strikes he has to trust his stuff and work ahead better
8152737 he threw a lot of pitches we had opportunities we just didnt score we let him off the hook
8152738 he just needs to get back to his family and hell come back when he can
8152739 he was his own worst enemy getting behind and walking some guys

8152754 i had never seen my opponent before that was the tricky part i thought the other guy played good for the pressure he was under
8152755 it would take a hell of an offer to let him go but ive not heard anything from anyone and i dont envisage anything happening at this late stage

8152763 effective friday aug 29 sheriff david smith will have resigned his office in order to assume a new position with the security office at the mountaineer race track amp gaming casino in accordance with both ohio revised code title 3 section 305 02 and the columbiana county republican partys by laws the county republican central committee has not less than four days nor more than 45 days after this vacancy in office occurs to meet and vote on a replacement
8152764 he made a mistake hes accepted responsibility for the mistake and hes moving on
8152765 theres no question in my mind that ray stone has the law enforcement experience the training and background and the integrity to perform the duties of sheriff of columbiana county
8152766 do we as a council want to say water for annexation
8152767 this was a contract and now reverts back to the old ordinance explain why we need to pass it again
8152768 do we want to continue that as a policy when that person shows up we have to say no by affirming and voting on it
8152769 another thing that bothers me is the old council granted an exception to the salem humane society as a non profit we might treat them differently they made that exception
8152770 if we want to defend this policy successfully in a future battle there are still going to be some people out there
8152771 official misconduct is being alleged here but i dont know if we have authority over him
8152772 anyone can call you a crook if theres something here then
8152773 ultimately mr schory doesnt have the authority to assign it

8152781 there is a desperate need for teachers in the third world
8152782 im going into a relatively remote area to help train primary teachers because there is such a need they are putting untrained youngsters into schools without any qualifications
8152783 they are really short of resources and many of the children have to walk a considerable distance
8152784 patient safety along with dignity in care is out most important objective this achievement is tangible evidence for patients staff other organisations and the public of the safety of the trusts services this accreditation means our insurance premium is also very much reduced and the money we save can be invested in clinical services
8152785 i talk to patients every day who have to cut their prescription medications in half or skip vaccinations for their children or put off appointments with their doctor all because of the unconscionable cost
8152786 will we pay insurance companies to limit access to care in a nation where more women die in childbirth than any other industrialized nation and 12 percent of veterans are uninsured its time we made healthcare a right for all and not a privilege for those who can afford it
8152787 were going to get this passed next year were going to make history
8152788 the insurance industry and its allies are a powerful foe but we have a group with us as well the public
8152789 and we have nurses and doctors and patients and millions of other americans who have quietly been organizing and holding town hall meetings and house parties and showings of movies like
8152790 you didnt go into healthcare to maximize profits you did it to maximize healthcare
8152791 when you are sick you go to the doctor for healthcare not for health insurance if were going to spend the money for healthcare we ought to at least get it
8152792 band aids are nice but they dont solve the problem its time for us to demand what we need what we deserve
8152793 the experts and the political realists who counsel us to settle for incremental solutions whose premise is more insurance not more care
8152794 on the anniversary of the enactment of the amendment for womens suffrage let us remember that we did not settle for a limited right to vote we did not settle for selective segregation when we fought for civil rights and we must not settle for partial restraints on an out of control healthcare industry
8152795 we need leaders and fighters like so many of you in this room who will not advise us to lower our expectations but challenge us and everyone around us to rise up and bring everyone else along with us
8152796 we know that change is on the way were moving in a new direction
8152797 we borrowed 3m from the health department in 2007 8 to be able to pay ongoing commitments this was borrowed before we had an agreed turnaround plan for the trusts financial recovery from years of historic overspends
8152798 it was initially a temporary loan reviewed monthly by the department when our turnaround plan was agreed by the strategic health authority in february the department was happy to convert this into a long term loan with scheduled repayments over 10 years
8152799 we also have a long term loan of 1 7m dating from march 2007 this is being repaid over three years and to date we have repaid 500 000
8152800 the application was made because mrs langford has so far refused to co operate with us
8152801 she will be made aware of the suspension order and the ball is now in her court she is perfectly entitled to apply to the court to have it lifted but she would have to first prove that she is co operating
8152802 we are pleased to see our position continuing to improve in what is widely considered to be the only credible international league table of universities
8152803 this table consolidates manchesters position as a major player on the world stage
8152804 it has made a huge difference to my life i no longer feel i am looking through a blurry screen it is fantastic news that people will not have to fight like i have done
8152805 the old show featured the whole range of vegetables fruit and flowers and classes for things like jams and pickles knitting and handicrafts
8152806 some took it extremely seriously with growers producing such fantastic results they must have treated it like a full time job
8152807 i hope the new show is a success it should have happened years ago
8152808 there has been a big resurgence in all things horticultural with more and more people deciding to grow their own fruit and vegetables
8152809 im proud to be related to such a great man
8152810 ive spoken to boxing trainer brian hughes who also wrote a book about jock and he says that todays boxers arent fit to lace his boots
8152811 he should have got life or a lot longer than six years the law over here is too lenient in other countries he would have got life im not happy he could have got a much longer sentence he didnt admit he had done wrong he wouldnt admit he was in the bus lane or was speeding
8152812 i dont have any sympathy for him in a way i wish my son had been killed outright rather than suffering as he did
8152813 he was just a lovely lad he would do anything for anybody he got on with his friends very well
8152814 gt la corte penal internacional cpi utiliza a frica como conejillo de indias
8152815 parece que la cpi usa al continente como un caso para realizar pruebas para determinar en qu manera el derecho internacional puede obtener m s legitimidad en el terreno
8152816 la cpi se concentra en la debilidad econ mica y pol tica de pa ses vulnerables y en naciones que no son capaces o no est n dispuestas a juzgar a perpetradores de cr menes contra la humanidad muchos pa ses africanos entran en este criterio
8152817 tenemos que preguntarnos si el castigo es un disuasivo suficiente para aquellos que violan los derechos humanos la intervenci n de la cpi es suficiente para detener cr menes contra la humanidad y cr menes de guerra en frica o en cualquier parte del mundo
8152818 el tribunal tendr a que hacer responsables a todos los tiranos pero esto no ocurre hasta ahora la mayor a de los acusados son africanos los poderosos como por ejemplo estados unidos nunca ser n llevados a juicio
8152819 rusia probablemente no ser juzgada por lo que est pasando en georgia y lo mismo pasa con china
8152820 debemos presentar un juicio contra el presidente zimbabwense robert mugabe a pesar de que esto podr a deteriorar aun m s la situaci n en zimbabwe o debemos darle la posibilidad de salir del gobierno lo cual contribuir a a una situaci n m s estable
8152821 no estoy muy en contra de esto ltimo pues traer a paz y estabilidad a zimbabwe
8152822 no es un experimento la cpi es permanente lleg para quedarse y no trata a ninguna parte del mundo como un experimento
8152823 el hecho es que frica jug un papel incre ble en la creaci n del tribunal
8152824 los casos que investiga la cpi en este momento fueron presentados por los propios estados parte excepto el de darfur que fue remitido por el consejo de seguridad de la onu por tanto no es verdad que el tribunal est concentrado solamente en frica pues la oficina del fiscal ha anunciado p blicamente que sigue de cerca la situaci n en otras partes del mundo por ejemplo en colombia y en afganist n
8152825 this is a very important way into wigan for thousands of people
8152826 if you are coming for the first time you could end up thinking that is what our borough is all about
8152827 i have been to america and i love the place
8152828 but i dont want to see their tastes in buildings here and in such an important location perhaps it would be appropriate in teletubby land or even in the states
8152829 but i will not support a building that appears to have been attacked by the tango man
8152830 we have consulted with neighbours and are in negotiations with the applicant about the amount of orange
8152831 wigan local authority has contacted us advising that concerns have been raised in relation to the external colour of taybarns wigan restaurant there are a number of taybarns restaurants across the country in the brand colour orange
8152832 these have been well received prior to the opening of taybarns wigan
8152833 when i got that hit to left field that guy started saying all kinds of stuff
8152834 hey i hit the ball hard people who know baseball know the guy rangers left fielder marlon byrd made a nice play i had no chance to make it to second i can deal with that
8152835 the next at bat when i hit the ball to left field he said the magic words
8152836 something personal about my family i dont deal well with that thats enough right there
8152837 pretty much from the get go i didnt have my good stuff
8152838 i couldnt get ahead my curveball and changeup werent really there overall not a very good night
8152839 right when i got out there i knew something wasnt right
8152840 i was struggling to get ahead it was just brutal
8152841 but even when he doesnt have his best stuff hes got quality stuff to get you out we did a good job of waiting him out and getting balls that were up in the zone
8152842 that was a very good inning against a guy who looks like hes on his way to the cy young
8152843 with brandon you have to be patient because he sinks the ball and tries to get you to chase his off speed stuff
8152844 i knew what to do to fix the problem but i couldnt do it
8152845 then we heard someone yell ahhhh we didnt think anything of it until we came outside
8152846 new yorkers voted it in and they deserve the right to vote it out if they so choose
8152847 if were going to spend this money for australia to rescue our water system we should be buying the water and not the land
8152848 while we still do not have a positive confirmation of where that c 130 is right now as of 11 15 this morning the tactical operations group 11 commander col isagani silva has just given me his report on some pieces of debris at the vicinity of davao gulf in between samal island and davao city
8152849 but we are still trying to confirm whether these pieces of debris were from the c 130 aircraft and the combat boots and some manuals they have recovered were from the pilots and crew of c 130 aircraft

8152951 while starting to cheat might be simple keeping an affair going has become almost impossible i would regularly counsel couples where an affair had lasted more than three years today he or she will first get proof and confront the result is that the length of affairs has dropped dramatically looking at all the evidence it seems that the end of the secret affair is in sight

8152996 abkhazia e ossezia del sud non vivranno mai pi con la georgia nello stesso stato
8152997 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8152998 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8152999 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8153018 nel corso degli ultimi tre anni spiega la ricerca con riferimento a un paniere di prodotti orticoli costruito in modo omogeneo la differenza tra il prezzo alla produzione e quello allingrosso risulta in italia superiore al 100 contro un valore mediamente del 60 in spagna e in francia
8153019 in questa fase per litalia si legge nello studio utilizzando i dati dellistituto di servizi per il mercato agricolo alimentare ismea si osserva un incremento medio di prezzo superiore al 50 nel complesso dal produttore al consumatore il ricarico totale del comparto e mediamente del 200
8153020 nel caso di filiere cortissime passaggio diretto dal produttore al venditore
8153021 prossimo al 300 nei casi in cui siano presenti 3 o 4 intermediari oltre al produttore e al distributore finale
8153022 a causa dellelevata stagionalit e deperibilit dei prodotti o a fronte di una scarsa organizzazione della produzione agricola
8153023 rappresentata in circa il 60 dei casi da un solo intermediario coincidente di norma con il mercato allingrosso
8153024 si caratterizza ancora per la presenza di una moltitudine di strutture di piccola dimensione a fronte dei 19 mercati allingrosso esistenti in francia e dei 23 in spagna in italia sono presenti quasi 150 strutture
8153025 una dimensione pari a meno di un quinto di quella delle realt minori in francia e spagna
8153026 poco meno della met delle strutture italiane risale agli anni sessanta e settanta e quasi un terzo e antecedente alla seconda guerra mondiale
8153027 il complesso dei mercati allingrosso si presenta insufficiente a trattare unofferta agricola rilevante ridistribuendola verso altri mercati di sbocco
8153028 iniziato in italia in ritardo rispetto agli altri paesi europei

8153104 cair has co sponsored and taken part in multiple islamist conferences in the united states
8153105 for months now fbi agents have been trained by cair to be sensitive to muslims this is completely self defeating
8153106 the agents are going to be misinformed and they will be overly sensitive and they will not ask certain questions
8153107 does not reflect the muslim community as a faith community but as a political group
8153108 cair trains fbi agents across the country on islam and how to treat muslims cairs archived press releases show numerous instances of cair representatives training the fbi as well as the marine corps local law enforcement and government employees
8153109 more than 150 law enforcement agents including fbi and joint terrorism task force supervisory personnel
8153110 representatives of cair chapters nationwide have met with tsa department of homeland security dhs and customs and border protection cbp officials on issues related to cultural sensitivity and national security and the department of justice
8153111 despite the known ties of the above mentioned organizations cair mas isna to the muslim brotherhood the u s government insists on engaging in outreach and dialogue with them this has led to an almost comical situation in which one side of the department of justice labels cair as an unindicted coconspirator in what has been alleged to be the biggest case of terrorist financing in the history of the republic while the other side of the department of justice meets with cair officials and attends cair conferences in an effort to perform outreach with the muslim american community while it can be argued that outreach with the muslim american community is a necessary component to a successful counterterrorism strategy there is absolutely no reason that this outreach has to go through organizations that ascribe to the ideology of the muslim brotherhood alternatively outreach can be performed at the grassroots level and through individuals respected in the muslim american community like doctors and local businessmen instead of through groups such as cair isna and mas
8153112 the default assumption still appears to be that islamism of any kind is more likely to be part of the problem rather than a potential component of counter terrorism solutions
8153113 if a group espouses violence its quite clear that the u s government should not be associated with it
8153114 we muslims can never be full citizens of this country because there is no way we can be fully committed to the institutions and ideologies of this country
8153115 every muslim who is honest would say i would like to see america become a muslim country
8153116 fbi director robert s mueller iii revealed during the hearing that the fbi has no counterideology response other than its outreach to muslim american communities so they understand the fbi and address the radicalization issue
8153117 i will support and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies foreign and domestic that i will bear true faith and allegiance to the same that i take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion and that i will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which i am about to enter so help me god

8153135 i did not want to enter into competition with the other orders
8153136 and i did not want it to be confined to one group of muslims or one aspect of islamic reform rather i sought that it be a general message based on learning education and jihad
8153137 it is the nature of islam to dominate not to be dominated to impose its law on all nations and to extend its power to the entire planet
8153138 allah ghayatuna al rasul zaimuna al qur an dusturuna al jihad sabiluna al mawt fi sabil allah asma amanina allah akbar allah akbar
8153139 god is our goal the quran is our constitution the prophet is our leader struggle jihad is our way and death in the service of god is the loftiest of our wishes
8153140 the common link here is the extremist muslim brotherhood all of these organizations are descendants of the membership and ideology of the muslim brothers

8153143 we will show them our signs in the universe and in their own selves until it becomes manifest to them that this the quran is the truth
8153144 the first stage through which all movements must pass the stage of propaganda communication and information
8153145 nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence
8153146 any place where the shariah is not enforced and where islam is not dominant becomes the abode of war dar ul harb
8153147 compromise with the practices of jahili society nor can we be loyal to it
8153148 jahili society because of its jahili characteristics described as evil and corrupt is not worthy to be compromised with

8153153 reviving the will of liberation and independence in the people and sowing the spirit of resistance
8153154 spreading and deepening the true concepts of islam as a complete methodology that regulates all aspects of life
8153155 the intentions of the islamic shariah which aim for the realization of the important aspects and needs and good achievements in the realm of religion and spirit and the self and property and intellect and wealth represent the ruling policy in the defining of the priorities of the goals and strategic policies
8153156 the islamic methodology aims to reform the state of limited capabilities to make it into a strong islamic state
8153157 the shiites attack one another the sunnis attack one another and the shiites attack the sunnis but the muslim brotherhood has a principle which i declared from day one the shiites and sunnis are brothers
8153158 id like to go back to the issue of al qaeda there is no such thing as al qaeda this is an american invention so that they will have something to fight for
8153159 what about osama bin laden al zawahiri and the islamic state of iraq
8153160 when one man or two or three fight this tyrannical global superpower is it worth anything
8153161 thousands have carried out attacks in the iraq in the name of al qaeda
8153162 that an al qaeda attack against the west at this time might hamper the islamic movements buildup and focus the west on the threat implicit in muslim communities
8153163 regarding resistance and jihad do you consider osama bin laden a terrorist or an islamic mujahid
8153164 in all certainty a mujahid and i have no doubt in his sincerity in resisting the occupation close to allah on high
8153165 the name is an american invention but al qaeda as a concept and organization comes from tyranny and corruption
8153166 so do you support the activities of al qaeda and to what extent
8153167 yes i support its activities against the occupiers and not against the people
8153168 our brothers in hamas in palestine the islamic resistance the islamic jihad after all the rest have given up and despaired the movement of the jihad brings us back to our faith
8153169 the city of hiraq once emperor of constantinople will be conquered first
8153170 you shall continue to fight the jews and they will fight you until the muslims will kill them and the jew will hide behind the stone and the tree and the stone and the tree will say oh servant of allah oh muslim this is a jew behind me come and kill him the resurrection will not come before this happens

8153181 mark thompson made a statement that is really directed at the geelong players more than at us
8153182 so hes dealing with his side theyre going through a lot of different emotions this week and hell deal with it in his own way and im interested to sit back and see how he deals with that and what impact it has
8153183 itd be a big win if we could do it but all we can guarantee is that well go out and give it everything not just count down the minutes in the game til the end of the season
8153184 this week well go out to compete and play at our best and the expectation is probably not that were a great chance to win but that anything can happen thats certainly the focus
8153185 it the loss taught us a good lesson theres no doubt about that not just from geelong but where we stood and why we couldnt really close any sort of gap to stop them scoring
8153186 that was a game where the players were pretty strong about not being beaten like that again but we have to make sure weve learned from it in the long term

8153192 this year 20 species seven ecological communities and two key threatening processes have been included for priority assessment they will now be thoroughly assessed to determine their national conservation status
8153193 the decision of what needs to be included in this list is based on a strategic national approach and puts a focus on the highest priority nominations
8153194 those assessed as threatened will be listed as matters of national environmental significance under the environment protection and biodiversity conservation act which will give them increased protection and the chance to be considered for conservation and recovery programs
8153195 this will help research into disease transmission and treatment and will support captive and wild populations
8153196 in addition to this its inclusion on this list means it will be assessed as a priority and if necessary its status will be upgraded increasing its protection under the epbc act
8153197 the koala is one of our greatest and most loved national icons and the government is committed to ensuring its ongoing conservation
8153198 two years ago koalas were assessed and did not at that stage meet the criteria for listing under the act however ive made a commitment to reassess the koala for listing and its conservation status will be thoroughly assessed
8153199 the review of the national strategy will provide input to the assessment of the koala the assessment will be thorough it cannot be rushed and could take up to two years
8153200 in developing this list a wide range of views from the community and expert scientific opinion are taken into consideration
8153201 senator browns remarks in the senate were characterised by many factual inaccuracies
8153202 church members their businesses and schools are subject to exactly the same regulations laws and scrutiny by government agencies tribunals and courts as other australian individuals businesses and schools
8153203 i was in a private area in the parents room behind the curtain and this cleaner just walked in on me and watched what i was doing
8153204 she told me the parents room was for parents and breastfeeding only and that i wasnt allowed to eat lunch in there
8153205 they told me that a little kid had been running around in the parents room and had briefly seen what i was doing and had complained to its mum she said
8153206 the mum then complained to security and the cleaner came in to inspect what i was doing they told me the complaint was that there was a topless woman eating her lunch in the parents room
8153207 its tough enough that i have to do this during my break but for a complaint to be made about me doing it is really upsetting
8153208 theres a public ignorance and theres still a lack of knowledge around breastfeeding and how it works she said
8153209 this mother was very humiliated and something like this could have seen the end of her expressing milk or working
8153210 its already very stressful and then to have someone complain about it is absolutely traumatising
8153211 above all its safety both for the motorists and for the pedestrians
8153212 when you have a walk flashing thats when youre allowed to proceed
8153213 we do have pedestrian crashes around the university corridor if we can reduce those thats our goal
8153214 i think ive done an excellent job and 65 percent of the vote is about what youd expect if youve done your job right
8153215 but then anything less than 100 percent is quieter than we wish

8153237 our findings provide a basis for opening up new therapeutic approaches to protect neurons from inflammation and toxicity induced neurodegeneration
8153238 selective cox 2 inhibitors were thought to be a promising medicine in treating neurodegenerative diseases stroke cancers and inflammation related diseases like arthritis however the occurrence of a series of cardiovascular complications in patients receiving cox 2 inhibitors has led to their recent withdrawal from the market and limits on their usages
8153239 therefore elevation of endogenous 2 ag levels by facilitating its production inhibiting its decomposition or directly supplying 2 ag may result in treatment advances to prevent the devastation of disorders like stroke alzheimers and traumatic brain injury
8153240 this study demonstrates the potential for personalized medicine combining selection of patients with a specific type of genetic mutation and a drug treatment that has been specifically designed to overcome that mutation
8153241 we are very pleased by this positive outcome from our ongoing collaboration with ptc the development of ptc124 fits well with our strategic goal of supporting approaches that have the potential to modify the course of cf we are continuing to work together with ptc and the broader cf medical community to support the next steps in the evaluation of ptc124 for the clinical benefit for the treatment of nonsense mutation cf
8153242 based on these results we intend to initiate a phase 2b study later this year to evaluate the clinical benefit of ptc124 in adults and children with nonsense mutation mediated cf given the potential applicability of ptc124 to multiple genetic disorders we have a pivotal study of ptc124 for nonsense mutation duchenne becker muscular dystrophy ongoing and are planning proof of concept studies in additional genetic disorders

8153258 a strong indication that more florida students are setting themselves on a path to a postsecondary education
8153259 we must continue to emphasize the need for increased access to rigorous coursework to ensure that our students are prepared for the challenges ahead
8153260 florida continues to have a significantly larger percentage of graduates taking the sat than is true nationwide this makes comparisons of florida scores with scores of the nation problematic since typically the larger the percentage of students taking a test the lower the average scores are likely to be
8153261 the primary purpose of the sat is for college admissions and it is highly valued by a vast majority of admissions officers

8153300 bei der tauerngasleitung h tten burgstaller amp co endlich gelegenheit sich die kologischen fu abdr cke im eigenen wirkungsbereich anzuschauen
8153301 am 12 m rz wurde die regierung vom landtag beauftragt die geplante gasleitung einem klimacheck zu unterziehen dieser liegt noch immer nicht vor es ist absurd dass die regierung an die b rgerinnen und b rger appelliert sich ihren kologischen fu abdruck anzuschauen und gleichzeitig genau diese pr fung bei einem projekt wie der tauerngasleitung nicht zustande bringt
8153302 diese gigantische leitung zieht sich quer durch unser bundesland der transport des gases ist sehr energieintensiv eine verdichterstation wie in flachau geplant verbraucht die eines ganzen salzach kraftwerkes sowohl der bau wie auch der betrieb werden sich unmittelbar auf die salzburger co2 bilanz auswirken wenn klimaschutz ernst gemeint sein soll dann m ssen wir diese co2 mengen irgendwo anders einsparen

8153309 hey are you just going to stare at me all night and check me out or are you going to come over here and talk to me
8153310 i hear there are some great books on the internet thatll help you overcome that
8153311 all right amy i just need to know because if tomorrow i wake up all bruised from you bouncing into me all night i need to be able to tell my buddy that i was in this bar last night and this girl amy kept bumping into me all night what do you play rugby or something
8153312 look i just got this text and i have absolutely no idea what it means no idea but before i show you the text on my phone i need to give you a little bit of a back story
8153313 last night i went out with this woman for a drink we had a glass of wine hung out for an hour and a half and that was it i didnt think there was any chemistry and i had no idea what she felt i didnt even think much of anything about it but i just got this text from her right now what does it mean
8153314 oh this weekend is so fantastic its my grandmothers birthday
8153315 karena asap tebal tersebut kami juga harus saling bergantian menembus asap menggunakan alat gas oksigen
8153316 kita sudah kirim surat sebulan yang lalu ke kpu untuk bekerjasama mengidentifikasi masalah masalah yang mungkin timbul dari setiap pengadaan barang dan jasa pemerintah hal itu untuk mencegah kemungkinan terjadinya penyimpangan di kpu
8153317 penyimpangan akan efektif dicegah jika terjadi perencanaan anggaran yang baik semenjak direncanakan sehingga tender barang dan jasa yang dijalankan akan sejalan atau on the right track
8153318 sekitar februari yang lalu komisi pemberantasan korupsi kpk sudah mengumpulkan kita semua termasuk kpu untuk bekerjasama dengan lkpbjp sebelum pemilu mendatang
8153319 it is going to be a slog to work though this but there is no easy way to do it
8153320 we havent seen the trough of the credit cycle yet
8153321 if the agency gets through the credit mess having handled the bank failures that are to come she is going to be widely seen as the person who prepared the agency for this
8153322 if the cycle is worse than expected and if the agency insurance fund isnt big enough or they didnt have enough examiners she will become the fall guy
8153323 while she and i were both disappointed because of our high hopes for gold it was not a bad meet fifth place in the world is an awesome accomplishment for anyone
8153324 she just didnt have the perfect day everything wasnt right each time she came down the runway she had a different approach
8153325 its like a great basketball player one night he scores 28 points and the next night he scores 22 youre the same athlete why did you score 22 points instead of 28 points sometimes you hit it sometimes you dont
8153326 this year brittney went from being a good collegiate athlete to becoming a great collegiate athlete she won the ncaas secs and all the collegiate honors you can attain but to do that it took a very long year
8153327 most of the people she had to jump against didnt have to stay on the top of their game as long as brittney did and that was a little bit of a disadvantage for her
8153328 our first and foremost focus will be to try to be prepared to win a gold medal in london
8153329 we feel like that is where her future is headed barring any unforeseen injuries or circumstances
8153330 so part of her change in training will be a little more emphasis on speed and well see how that goes

8153355 i think prices could fall below us 100 a barrel on slowing global demand and rising production in the us brazil and canada and from opec states such as saudi arabia and angola
8153356 that scenario is now more realistic than any time in the past five years
8153357 i think it would be more valuable to save it for real emergencies
8153358 by small increments over long periods of time doesnt have a lot of impact on price

8153361 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8153362 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8153363 it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed and to recent russian statements
8153364 it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories
8153365 the computer models are all over the place right now
8153366 its too early to theorize on galveston the potential is there but its too early to narrow down where it might go
8153367 he said he is feeling better and is ready to go home
8153368 he was not totally unconscious but it was hurting him he was moving his arms when they took him away on the stretcher
8153369 a witness near him saw what he believed was a spark of electricity between him and the tool he was reaching for
8153370 a few guys saw it but im not sure if it hit him or right beside him
8153371 one of the guys said it hit the top of his head but i didnt see his shoes messed up
8153372 i knew it hit somewhere i could tell it was close then everybody started yelling and i ran over there
8153373 part of the roof was knocked off and it landed on braniff road and knocked down some power lines

8153377 were not set up to go out and do the great big fight in one night it takes us several nights to go out and catch up
8153378 i live on the bay side and i cant even sit on my deck
8153379 i cant walk out to the bird feeder without having my legs completely covered with them
8153380 i was talking to my sister districts and theyre all scrambling too trying to catch up with these things hopefully by the weekend it will be better i wont say theyll be gone but hopefully theyll be better
8153381 there was no incentive for fidelity to promote auction rate securities
8153382 my plans are to be a board member that is very interactive at the actual school building level and begins an immediate cooperation with all teachers
8153383 this is a good first half performance demonstrating our competitiveness against a background of weaker economies and increased input costs
8153384 we have maintained the momentum of our topline growth and again ensured that the outperforms the market and increases its share of the international premium segment
8153385 do what they say get out of here and move forward this never happened it will shock you how much it never happened
8153386 if theres no risk it means the status quo doesnt care what you are doing because you are not a threat
8153387 for me its pretty steady continuous work and im kind of playing continuously even though its not necessarily a national tour or a publicity campaign im just playing all the time
8153388 i missed my band a lot and getting to make an album where youre rehearsed and you have production and youre ready to play these songs is a real pleasure for me
8153389 im not sure what it would be like to be the other way anymore because of the way in which the music business has changed and sort of been denigrated
8153390 i think its perfectly good for music that the record companies are sort of in decline and the ones that are doing the more interesting things are small independent labels that are run by music lovers people who really do it for passionate personal musically ideological reasons

8153395 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8153396 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8153397 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8153398 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8153399 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8153400 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8153401 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8153402 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8153403 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8153404 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8153405 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8153406 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8153407 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8153408 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8153409 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8153410 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8153411 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8153412 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8153413 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8153414 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8153415 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8153416 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8153417 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8153418 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8153419 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8153420 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8153421 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8153422 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8153423 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8153424 no one works for someone we all just work together
8153425 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8153426 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8153427 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8153428 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8153429 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8153430 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8153431 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8153432 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8153433 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8153434 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8153435 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
8153436 this is a planning took where all things are going
8153437 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8153438 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8153439 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8153440 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8153441 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8153442 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8153443 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8153444 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8153445 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8153446 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8153447 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8153448 right now i dont trust the republicans especially at the local level
8153449 its not an intuitive thing there are people who have been convicted in federal court
8153450 we need him in washington i dont think we can afford to lose him there
8153451 im not a big fan of the prosecutions charges but i think hes got some ethical issues that put a cloud over him
8153452 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8153453 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8153454 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8153455 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8153456 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8153457 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8153458 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8153459 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8153460 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8153461 ce n tait pas vident il y a eu un peu de tout des hauts et des bas

8153466 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
8153467 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8153468 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8153469 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8153470 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
8153471 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8153472 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8153473 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8153474 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8153475 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8153476 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8153477 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8153478 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8153479 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8153480 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8153481 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8153482 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8153483 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8153484 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8153485 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8153486 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8153487 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8153488 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8153489 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8153490 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8153491 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8153492 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8153493 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

8153557 part of his pitch was that he needed this womans name on paper to indicate that he had talked to her
8153558 once he was inside there was a struggle he subdued her drugged her and took her into a back bedroom where he sexually assaulted her
8153559 it is believed the suspect left the unconscious victim for dead

8153607 could not believe how close he obama was to becoming president
8153608 i just cant believe were sitting here today discussing allowing belt air in coal mines
8153609 if youve ever been backed in a corner with nowhere to go thats what its like
8153610 you can put all the sensors and warnings you want but when the fire breaks out the same results are going to happen again and again miners are going to lose their lives
8153611 take special care to evaluate whether the belt air can be routed to the working fact in a manner that is safe for all miners involved

8153624 our goodwill to keep turkeys eu path open is not without limit
8153625 if we see that turkey is not being positive or constructive in its stance at a time when a new phase in finding a cyprus solution has begun then we should reconsider our general policy towards turkeys eu accession
8153626 above all lets not forget that turkeys european prospects depend on cypruss consent because from time to time this is forgotten especially by our european partners
8153627 from 2004 cyprus has continually accepted turkeys accession course but weve seen absolutely no goodwill gesture from the turkish side either towards the cyprus republic or its eu obligations towards cyprus

8153636 a revised country health plan was expected by the end of this month but there is no guarantee it will be ready by then
8153637 yet another example of why the rann government cannot be trusted when it comes to managing the south australian healthcare system
8153638 minister hill made the announcement he would be amending his ill conceived plan at the end of july to take the heat off his department following the exposure of a radiation bungle at the royal adelaide hospital
8153639 minister hill told country residents he would have a new plan for them at the end of august and now his office is saying that might not be happening
8153640 now it has been exposed the new plan may not even be ready and the minister true to his style is nowhere to be seen
8153641 it is contemptible that minister hill is going to produce a plan before his own taskforce has completed its investigation
8153642 south australians deserve a health system which provides safe and efficient care for everyone not a system which is being downgraded and dismantled by a government which is out of touch
8153643 yesterday she said the revised plan shouldnt be released this month today she is saying it should be released this month

8153665 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8153666 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8153667 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8153668 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8153669 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8153670 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba

8153672 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8153673 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8153674 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8153675 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8153676 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8153677 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8153678 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8153679 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8153680 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8153681 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

8153686 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8153687 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8153688 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8153689 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8153690 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8153691 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8153692 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8153693 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8153694 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8153695 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8153696 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8153697 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8153698 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8153699 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8153700 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8153701 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8153702 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8153703 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8153704 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8153705 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8153706 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8153707 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8153708 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8153709 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8153710 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8153711 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8153712 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8153713 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8153714 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8153715 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8153716 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8153717 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8153718 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8153719 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8153720 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8153721 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8153722 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8153723 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8153724 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8153725 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8153726 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8153727 the markets for mainstay mems actuator products like inkjet heads and digital light processor dlp chips from texas instruments finally have passed the baton to mems sensors to drive the next growth wave in the market

8153780 we were a very young team and still learning then we got that pole at houston and we had a chance to win that race we were able to go on and get four podium finishes in 2007 as a rookie organization that was a solid start for the team
8153781 wow that lime rock weekend was huge for patr n highcroft racing acura and myself
8153782 that is a weekend i will always remember we were racing close to the teams headquarters 45 minutes away and we had a big group of supporters at the race then we won the pole having just nipped my friend gils de ferran car it was a one two qualifying performance for acura and it was the first time for that feat then to come back and pass timo on the next to last lap for the overall win was incredible i am so proud to be a part of acura racing history with that victory

8153792 after our initial year in the american le mans series in 2007 we worked hard in the off season to contend for the 2008 season title and win more races and poles
8153793 the development of the acura arx 01b chassis was important for our teams to be competitive unlike the 2007 season all four acura teams are running the new chassis and we continue to update the car with new parts and pieces we have very professional teams running for acura and we expect those operations to race consistently at the front of the alms field
8153794 the long beach race was big for our team our sponsor patr n and of course acura
8153795 sure it was nice for me as a driver but the immediate elation for the highcroft team after our struggle last year as a new lmp2 team was great and to win in acuras backyard was huge as was it for patr n in a big los angeles market that gave everyone a lot of confidence for the rest of the season
8153796 our team had so many things to catch up with in the early portion of the year
8153797 our first test was just a month before the utah race so it was very hectic getting up to speed on everything that goes into building a team it was thrilling watching the team come together as a unit then nearly winning the pole and the race was another great thrill for me and our team

8153825 the acura program is been a big boost for the company we have expanded hpd in several areas and outsourced the things we are not familiar with at this point but we plan to learn more about the things we outsource and develop those things within hpd and we might like to do the same things with other racing applications down the road our company name is honda performance development our business is racing and that is what we do but maybe we move into the performance side in the future
8153826 it is very interesting to work in meetings with other companies and sanctioning bodies
8153827 there is so much planning that goes on behind the scenes and it is a unique experience to discuss racing applications with other groups

8153946 go and give the milk to the people in the house across the street
8153947 lord this is insane those people are asleep and if i wake them up they are going to be mad and i will look stupid
8153948 okay god if this is you i will go to the door and i will give them the milk if you want me to look like a crazy person okay i want to be obedient i guess that will count for something but if they dont answer right away i am out of here

8153953 and now i will show you the most excellent way if i speak in the tongues of men and of angels but have no love i am only a resounding gong or clanging cymbal if i have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge and if i have a faith that can move mountains but have not love i am nothing if i give all i possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames but have not love i gain nothing love is patient love is kind it does not envy it does not boast it is not proud it is not rude it is not self seeking it is not easily angered it keeps no record of wrongs love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth it always protects always trusts always hopes always perseveres love never fails but where there are prophecies they will cease where there are tongues they will be stilled where there is knowledge it will pass away for we know in part and we prophecy in part but when perfection comes the imperfect disappears when i was a child i talked like a child i thought like a child i reasoned like a child when i became a man i put childish ways behind me now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror then we shall see face to face now i know in part then i shall know fully even as i am fully known and now these three remain faith hope and love but the greatest of these is love

8154025 we can now concentrate all of our energies on what we do best
8154026 as president and vice president barack and joe will change washington so that instead of just talking about family values we actually have policies that value families
8154027 these folks get it theyve touched theyve tapped into a fundamental essence of what the country is the people they dont want you to give them a handout they want you to give them a chance
8154028 it gives voters a sense of how politicians will do their job in november
8154029 our hope is when enough people find out about us they wont have to let the spin determine their vote

8154096 that is what we call tsukumogami on its one hundredth anniversary of its creation an object may become invested with a spirit they are the lowest of our kind and i am a collector of them
8154097 im sorry but i cant control the tsukumogami any more than you can control the sun they are nearly animals and i have never done well with animals
8154098 i had deluded myself into thinking that i was one of the most handsome guys in school
8154099 then i started wondering why i never kissed any of the girls
8154100 they call you free ride she said because you take girls out and never try anything
8154101 i wound up dating with renee and it was the greatest thing to ever happen to me we dated through the rest of our first year in high school and spent the summer going on outings i tried so hard to convince her to go to the beach when we did
8154102 a riptide pulled her out to sea i tried to save her i was a much stronger swimmer than she was when she sank into the sea i went under the water to find her i must have swam too deep because i started losing my breath i dont remember how the change happened but i remember waking up on the beach early the next morning i had a shell on my back and a bowl of water on my head
8154103 hell be back soon enough probably just needs some space guys can be like that sometimes you should know that
8154104 the promises a man makes die when the man dies you are an oni now grant you really should let go of your old life
8154105 i saw our defense really come in and play well today and thats what carried us
8154106 were switching from a team that expects its pitcher or one other key player to dominate to a team that just needs its pitcher to give us a ball we can field
8154107 mariah has really stepped up and became a dominant force out there for us
8154108 i think we just got content with our lead there and allowed too many errors that let them back in it
8154109 this was a huge win for us and its just good to know what were capable of
8154110 ive only seen two 8 man football games in my life
8154111 i feel pretty good about the players i have im not worried about how they will perform but i am concerned about how ill do i have no history in 8 man to base it off of ill be watching a lot of tapes to get prepared
8154112 hes got the strongest arm ive seen in a long while
8154113 we can compete in speed with guys like michael carl
8154114 its the defensive part that worries me most im not sure what kind of defense will work and be sound enough against our opponents
8154115 well be really competitive this year and im expecting big things this season
8154116 this is the first season i really believe that we have a shot at the postseason
8154117 our league will have many young teams this year and most of us are rebuilding
8154118 however florence will not be rebuilding they never have to
8154119 we want to win the league championship and then see how far we can go in the playoffs every year
8154120 however there are many very good teams in this league and manitou is the defending champion so we will have to play well every week and hopefully improve with each game
8154121 florence is always very tough but there are four or five teams in this league that could make a run at it
8154122 manitou st marys cscs and trinidad are all going to be in the mix as well
8154123 all we try to do is make the kids better with every game and go forward we have respect for all of the teams in this league
8154124 this league is so competitive every year and we get so few playoff spots
8154125 it makes it fun and every game is very important
8154126 right now id say were all pretty much the same level
8154127 weve got two good d linemen returning beau kelly and jaden terry thats a pretty dangerous tandem
8154128 theyre throwing and catching well andre is going to be really really good
8154129 we went with the approach that the best 11 will be on defense first
8154130 this is probably as much depth as ive had coming back in 23 years as a head coach
8154131 we had a really good offseason had kids that worked really hard we feel really good about the senior class we have
8154132 were going to feature one of the premier defensive players in the league devyn harris
8154133 weve got a couple of good young d tackles every kid is excited about playing every coach is excited about coaching
8154134 were not sure where we stack up with everybody else around the city and around the state
8154135 its just so hard at the start of the season to find out where you measure up and find out what youve got
8154136 we run the true triple option so he is reading defenses and thats tough
8154137 the colorado state fair would like to thank the generous buying groups who support colorados youth in agriculture without them this event would not be possible
8154138 the young people who participate in this event need to be recognized for their hard work and dedication and the jr livestock sale provides that recognition
8154139 i am so proud of all of these kids who worked so hard and i would like to thank our generous buyer groups and sponsors

8154149 we only have four returning starters but we think that were still sitting pretty for this season
8154150 we have a lot of guys that got a lot of reps last season and our freshman team was also very good last year
8154151 i dont think theres going to be any kind of hangover for this team
8154152 we realize how close we were last year but we have turned the page and were ready for more success this season
8154153 our conference is very tough and it is better than some of the 4a leagues
8154154 but for now youve got to put falcon pueblo county and pueblo central at the top
8154155 we have a lot of new kids and a big freshman class this season
8154156 but a lot of our kids are experienced and we should be able to make some noise
8154157 every conference game is going to be a battle this season
8154158 i think some of the sophomores and freshmen can be a little intimidated when they first come out
8154159 i think in some ways it takes the pressure off some of the younger girls to have those four though
8154160 they know that those girls are going to carry the team so they have some time to learn to fit into the system before it will be their turn
8154161 weve really matured on our back line and having confidence on defense is just going to give us that many more opportunities up front
8154162 with bree and tracee up front we really have a great offense going
8154163 this is the best senior class to come through rampart
8154164 unless someone tells me differently id put pueblo south up there again
8154165 pueblo south and sierra seem to be the two teams to beat early on this may be sierras year to challenge
8154166 our qb is amazing our running backs are going to be great were really going to expect some big things from the guys up front
8154167 hopefully we just get our coaching staff to put them in the right situation and get out of the way
8154168 i feel like our offensive line will be pretty solid
8154169 our offense will probably be a little bit ahead of defense to start the year

8154185 our landline billing system as of now works on the conventional technology and we are unable to give a customised offer to subscribers but very soon all that will be a thing of the past
8154186 one of the advantages of the new billing system is that one single bill could be generated for an entire corporate house and the payments also accordingly be made from any where in the country
8154187 in addition we will be able to offer various tariff plans to landline customers on the lines of mobile tariff plans
8154188 as the it and telecom requirements of the enterprises are increasing we aim to become a one stop shop for all their requirements be it voice data application security or any other such need
8154189 as a part of the mns we are also in the process of introducing global audio conferencing to our subscribers
8154190 sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8154191 nak jaz ne govorim o mno i nem samomoru niammo ve
8154192 to ozra je smo si zaslu ili delamo kar nam pa e a ta

8154197 the quest to build the incredible opinion that crushes races
8154198 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8154199 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8154200 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8154201 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8154202 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8154203 technical issues on the part of our software vendor are no excuse for my behavior and i take full responsibility and ask for your forgiveness in this matter
8154204 wrote these words deliberately now they are upset because they got caught
8154205 slattery could have stepped up to the plate personally like a statesman and taken responsibility for his staff and the climate of name calling and childishness he has fostered
8154206 instead he and his team chose to throw a junior staffer under the bus and hoped no one would notice
8154207 i jim slattery and the campaign think that the comment was completely inappropriate
8154208 as a u s senator from kansas pat roberts deserves greater respect than what was given
8154209 my only comment is i have seen it and we have no comment
8154210 he has to be good for arabs because he is a muslim
8154211 he cant be a christian his middle name is hussein
8154212 there are thousands of entrepreneurs with new solutions and investors are lining up to back them
8154213 green technology is where the computer industry was in 1984 the year the macintosh computer was introduced
8154214 think about how far we ve come since then and that s how far reaching and transformational green technology will be
8154215 that s because other countries have smart stable forward looking energy policies
8154216 ich halte die risiken der politischen szenarien in hessen f r unvertretbar
8154217 wird das sie selbst die spd in hessen und die bundes spd vor der bundestagswahl schwer besch digen
8154218 ist sie abh ngig von der linken und den traumata des herrn lafontaine
8154219 sie begibt sich in die h nde einer partei die einfluss ohne verantwortung ohne jede verpflichtung h tte die w chentlich daf r sorgen kann dass regierungsf higkeit wieder verloren geht
8154220 es st rt mich dass die linke nicht in eine politische haftung genommen werden w rde
8154221 an integration of the visual media via fat albert and the cosby kids into the elementary school curriculum as a teaching aid and vehicle to achieve increased learning understands the work and pressure that accompany an education
8154222 pressure people talk about pressure like its going to be 30 lashes on your back with your cat of nine tails with your shirt ripped open at the back and the salt air pressure
8154223 at temple university the person who founded temple university called it acres of diamonds now when you think about a diamond you very simply ask yourself what makes the quality of a diamond that which was a piece of coal and the answer is pressure
8154224 the big 12 is half road and half home so you have to be keyed in and focused no matter where you are it can be a distraction its a distraction in all sports to be in a different facility but you have to be good at it and even more important for us we need to be good at it right off the bat
8154225 the tough opponents will help us more than anything else
8154226 its not hard to get up for that and when your opponent is better you tend to play better hopefully we put ourselves in a position to improve our team all of these teams have really only been in the team for two weeks so everyone has to rush to get on track as much as coaches like to think these games dont matter they do
8154227 for the most part im very pleased with their ability to keep up the intensity
8154228 when school starts we did see a little drop in concentration we just have to keep reminding them that we see a little drop but with everything thats going on and the excitement they have about getting to play again theyre going to be fine
8154229 texas a amp m soccer is known nationally weve established a national reputation and our reputation right now is that were a team that likes to play attractive soccer we play a style thats fun for players and its very good for helping players develop to play beyond the college level
8154230 this group collectively has really great impact players and has the potential to be the best weve had here
8154231 but they also all buy into the team first way we have of doing things here and thats whats important
8154232 initially this north carolina game was going to be our opener the ncaa chose another week at the beginning of the season that gives us two more home games before the carolina game so were hoping that we can work out the kinks right now we have a team of teenagers and we need them to get up to speed learn the system and get used to each other extremely fast

8154236 the evidential test has not been passed and it would be simply wrong to bring the prosecution
8154237 its not just deeply offensive to me and my team although it is but it also risks undermining confidence amongst the victims of child abuse that justice will be done
8154238 its really absolutely essential that any complainants or witnesses who have any evidence or any allegations they wish to make must tell the police what that evidence is so the complaints can be investigated
8154239 if the evidence is there the prosecutions will be brought and pursued with a great deal of vigour but i find the allegation of obstructing justice very unhelpful
8154240 the economic health of galveston is pretty sturdy but we have a sense that people are more pinched by the cost of food and fuel
8154241 we want people to recognize what it has done in the past to touch the community
8154242 were convinced people will see these good things happening around them and be willing to come back this year to support the campaign
8154243 were not set up to go out and do the great big fight in one night it takes us several nights to go out and catch up
8154244 i live on the bay side and i cant even sit on my deck
8154245 were not set up to go out and do the great big fight in one night it takes us several nights to go out and catch up
8154246 i live on the bay side and i cant even sit on my deck
8154247 i cant walk out to the bird feeder without having my legs completely covered with them
8154248 i was talking to my sister districts and theyre all scrambling too trying to catch up with these things hopefully by the weekend it will be better i wont say theyll be gone but hopefully theyll be better
8154249 how should i be a totally devoted person so as to keep the first commandment
8154250 take careful heed to yourselves for you saw no form
8154251 whatever forms of god man devises are diametrically opposed to his nature therefore as soon as idols appear true religion is corrupted and adulterated
8154252 come make us gods that shall go before us for as for this moses the man who brought us up out of the land of egypt we do not know what has become of him
8154253 this is your god o israel that brought you out of the land of egypt
8154254 if we cannot imagine jesus as a tree as a river and as rain then we are doomed together
8154255 the computer models are all over the place right now
8154256 its too early to theorize on galveston the potential is there but its too early to narrow down where it might go
8154257 maybe if he didnt have such a large posse the naacp wouldnt always be in debt
8154258 he said he is feeling better and is ready to go home
8154259 he was not totally unconscious but it was hurting him he was moving his arms when they took him away on the stretcher
8154260 a witness near him saw what he believed was a spark of electricity between him and the tool he was reaching for
8154261 a few guys saw it but im not sure if it hit him or right beside him
8154262 one of the guys said it hit the top of his head but i didnt see his shoes messed up
8154263 i knew it hit somewhere i could tell it was close then everybody started yelling and i ran over there
8154264 part of the roof was knocked off and it landed on braniff road and knocked down some power lines
8154265 my plans are to be a board member that is very interactive at the actual school building level and begins an immediate cooperation with all teachers

8154267 its awesome mate the first time you see it in real life its a shock factor to be real honest
8154268 its just so big obviously its an extremely impressive boat very very powerful
8154269 for us at the end of the day its all part of our preparation when you look at this boat you just think boy who wouldnt want to see two of these boats race each other its amazing i cant tell you how many four letter words people have used when they see it
8154270 its something that im pretty excited about the main thing with multihulls is you always try to sail as light as you can but with a boat like this and the power its got its also going to take a lot of physical effort by the crew its going to be an interesting few months
8154271 es gibt keine benotung es gibt keinen stundenplan die schwerpunktsetzung des kindergartens im rahmen dieses bildungsplans ist den p dagoginnen berlassen
8154272 who knows what she really thinks with all the missteps that have taken place this is the only thing she could do so yes im still bitter
8154273 thats the thing that sticks with you even if she can move on easily thats not as easy for everybody else
8154274 ive never been prouder of a democrat than i was tonight
8154275 she said it better than i ever could have everything i worked for and that she worked for would be at risk if we do anything less
8154276 im not going to vote for obama im not going to vote for mccain either
8154277 we love her but its our vote if we dont trust him or dont like him
8154278 yes the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8154279 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8154280 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8154281 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8154282 those are the reasons i ran for president these are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8154283 a colleague and a friend who has served his country with honor
8154284 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8154285 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8154286 barack obama has a different vision and a different plan
8154287 the detroit city council has wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars paying for an attorney to conduct a political witch hunt
8154288 if someone rides up to a convenience store with a sawed off shotgun and a prior record im not intimidating anybody by calling the cops if this republican campaign is going to be run in mccarthyite fashion by lawbreakers in an illegal way they are going to pay a price
8154289 why would barack obama be friends with somebody who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
8154290 if you cant get excited about voting for mccain these are the kinds of ads that get them excited about voting against obama
8154291 district residents risked their lives in battle in iraq and afghanistan
8154292 what he was doing rather than criticizing bush he was comparing the difference between him and sen barack obama
8154293 and saying we do not want to see more of the same in the next election which is what we could get if mccain wins
8154294 ms miers testimony may help congress finally determine what remedial legislative steps if any should be taken in response to the forced resignations
8154295 has supplied no justification and the court cannot fathom one for its failure to turn over non privileged documents to the committee
8154296 todays ruling clearly rejects the white houses efforts to run out the clock on the committees investigation
8154297 it is difficult to see how the executive can demonstrate that it has a substantial likelihood of success on appeal or even that a serious legal question is presented
8154298 she noted john mccain was not using hillarys clips on health care on iraq on all the things she was so diametrically opposed to john mccain over
8154299 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware

8154321 help smes understand their energy bills help them figure out how energy efficient their business is and then to help them develop a strategy
8154322 one of the biggest obstacles is making companies aware of what their energy is and what they use it for and to make them aware of the alternatives indigenous energy thatis on their doorstep
8154323 we want them to be aware of renewable energies that can help them and to be aware of grants schemes that are out there

8154330 hunter biden met with the obama senate office not with senator obama
8154331 its hardly surprising that a senator from illinois would fight for investments in mercy hospital thorek hospital and st xavier university right in illinois or that hed be joined in that effort by a republican colleague representative judy biggert
8154332 oh ive got to get my picture with biff henderson of letterman hold on a second
8154333 i havent yet run into anybody who doesnt want one in fact i usually run into people who want more than one
8154334 weve got a lot to be proud of in the democratic party
8154335 i saw everybody walking out of the hall with those michelle signs
8154336 but i can never get home with any ive left a lot behind for the hotel maids
8154337 a lot of a convention is about the image that is projected to the country
8154338 these are probably gonna be thrown in the trash now
8154339 but i hope to get a few of them to show my boys that their dad amounted to something at some point
8154340 we all know that he wants to be loved just call him call him any time of day or night
8154341 talk to him about anything talk to him about the olympics or what he thinks about a certain congressional district or even about the
8154342 no one agrees with a hundred percent of whats in there the vast majority of this platform john mccain agrees with
8154343 is he bound to it no but it represents the overarching principles of what our party believes
8154344 we wanted it to be shorter more principled forward looking
8154345 the same human activity that has brought freedom and opportunity to billions has also increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8154346 republicans caution against the doomsday climate change scenarios peddled by aficionados of centralized command and control government
8154347 we can and should address global warming without succumbing to the no growth radicalism that treats climate questions as dogma rather than as situations to be managed responsibly
8154348 when new evidence came in to suggest that his initial assessment of putin was wrong bush tended to dismiss it
8154349 maliki is proving to be a more significant leader than most people around bush thought he could be
8154350 last year everyone i talked to in the administration thought that maliki had to go bush didnt seem to buy off on what everyone else was saying
8154351 while there are often policy issues that dont exactly go the way we want them to the situation on the other hand could be much worse if the president did not have a decent working relationship with some of these leaders
8154352 there is something that personal relations can add but there are fundamental national interests that cant be escaped
8154353 i promise you if you ask the russians they will give you a long litany of things where they think they have cooperated with us and we havent given much in return
8154354 you can still have parties just like at past conventions but you need to talk to a lawyer to make sure youre not putting your donors your sponsors your guests members of congress and staff in an ethical quandary
8154355 the relevant ethics committees have advised us of their decision and we have informed all staff of that
8154356 its up to each individual staff member to decide their attendance for those who come it will be an informative and exciting event
8154357 if they undertake reasonable good faith efforts to make sure every house staffer pays theyll likely be okay
8154358 he told me he said dont stop speaking when he comes into the station
8154359 and she said you know hes the same ol joe
8154360 instead night after night week after week year after year he returned home to wilmington on a lonely amtrak train
8154361 a seventy five minute trip passes really quickly when youre talking with joe
8154362 some mornings he would ride down on the train and literally buy the entire car and conductors coffee
8154363 the engineer saluted him with a longer than usual toot of the trains whistle
8154364 he used to have a picnic at his house for the train crews
8154365 ive seen him take the 10 p m train home and take the 7 a m train the next morning
8154366 just so he could sleep in the bed with his wife and see his kids in the morning
8154367 one of those things that i keep telling my colleagues if they fully funded amtrak i would not be late
8154368 im not going to see him like i used to
8154369 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8154370 now these next three days i think youre going to see an intensity of attack
8154371 but you know you dont want to get negative choppy every single day and i think what were seeing today here is a democratic party thats positive thats unified that wants to heal that wants to bring bipartisanship and you know ill talk about that too
8154372 if the republicans are good at anything they are experts at fear and smear divide and conquer
8154373 what we have to do though i think is rebut those charges but also to point out the real mccain record
8154374 understands a lot more about how people have to struggle economically than john mccain will ever in his whole lifetime
8154375 warner youre crazy go get a real job nobodys ever going to want a phone in their car
8154376 lets go borrow money from china so we can buy oil from countries that dont like us
8154377 i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past
8154378 no challenge too great for a world that stands as one
8154379 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8154380 the terms of the financing available did not enable a sufficiently compelling alternative cash offer to be made for tns
8154381 any equipment that has been used in freshwater has the potential to carry the alga particularly larger recreational equipment such as kayaks rafts and paddles
8154382 much more drastically needs to be done at airports and ports its not coordinated and its not seen as being serious enough
8154383 the bottom line is that once it gets in here theres no way to control it
8154384 it will run rampant particularly in tasmania because it loves cold water that runs fast
8154385 australian biosecurity officers are not doing nearly enough at points of entry
8154386 anglers are a high risk pathway but bushwalkers boots are of interest to quarantine officers for various reasons so i dont think its fair to say they are not getting reasonable attention
8154387 and my understanding is that the import requirements for didymo are being reviewed and that includes looking at different treatment options
8154388 but its fair to say that whatever we do there will be an inconvenience to anglers bushwalkers and others returning from new zealand

8154397 every effort to try and portray john mccain as someone that doesnt connect with the american people will fall extraordinarily short just as short as the effort to say hes the continuation of george w bush
8154398 what republicans consider to be the greatest threat of the civilized world
8154399 john mccain earned his homes through the hard work insight and fortitude of his family and himself
8154400 i dont think the politics of envy end up being successful in the final analysis

8154553 the permatang pauh by election results is a clear message for barisan nasional umno and its leaders within five months after the march 8 polls barisan lost the seat again with a bigger majority than the last time
8154554 this is not only because the by election was held in permatang pauh and one of the candidates was anwar ibrahim i believe this will be the trend at other places as well and those who came out to vote on tuesday had voted for the opposition
8154555 i dont think abdullah is a match for anwar this man anwar can convince even the devil to follow him he is going to raise all kinds of issues and questions and will demand and pressure the prime minister for answers it is going to be a tough time for barisan
8154556 the people sent a message at the march 8 polls and again in the permatang pauh by election leaders should sit up and take stock of this they want changes and they want it quick not in june 2010
8154557 if changes are made two years from now then umno will face an uphill task to gain strength and the peoples confidence if they fail to do so then barisan can expect defeat in the 13th general election

8154616 lucentis is an expensive drug costing more than 10 000 for each eye treated
8154617 but that cost needs to be balanced against the likely cost savings
8154618 it has been estimated that the costs related to sight impairment for patients treated with lucentis are around 8 000 cheaper than for patients who receive best supportive care over a 10 year period
8154619 our guidance means that patients who are suitable for this treatment will have the same access to it irrespective of where they live
8154620 it is a victory for thousands bringing overwhelming relief to desperate people across the country
8154621 finally the torment faced by elderly people forced to either spend their life savings on private treatment or go blind is over
8154622 nices guidance will finally bring an end to a cruel postcode lottery
8154623 we are very pleased and relieved that nice has issued this long awaited final guidance
8154624 thousands of patients with the wet type of macular degeneration who are at grave risk of losing their precious remaining sight quite suddenly have prayed for this day to arrive that day is finally here
8154625 many hundreds of vulnerable patients have been subjected to an appalling emotional rollercoaster ride for the past two years during which many of them have lost their remaining sight
8154626 the reimbursement scheme is an innovative approach which shows how pharmaceutical companies can work together with nice and the department of health to ensure patients do get access to treatments on the nhs

8154635 she painted even as a child but after she stopped going to school she took up art seriously she is very emotional and blessed with talent there are times when she has made our parents more proud than i ever have
8154636 we have great control of land and infrastructure in this area expertise gained from our quebec shale play has allowed us to re evaluate our past results we believe we have been able to correlate the results to particular shale qualities which greatly encourage us that a predictive model can be created the very high gas in place numbers and promising production results from our two wells in the liard shales make this test very interesting
8154637 we are excited about the prospects of the liard basin shale and we see the similarities to the horn river shale the license has six existing well bores the surface infrastructure and the export line that all add significant commercial advantage we also see the value in the continuation of the development of the upper shales which have produced strongly over the past two years and believe this work program will highlight the shale commerciality in the liard basin
8154638 discovered resources are those quantities of oil and gas estimated on a given date to be remaining in plus those quantities already produced from known accumulations discovered resources are divided into economic and uneconomic categories with the estimated future recoverable portion classified as reserves and contingent resources respectively

8154647 the government and police must change their attitude they should not expect victims to come to police stations police must go to the victims and hear their grievances only then justice can be said to have been done
8154648 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8154649 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8154650 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8154651 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8154652 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8154653 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche
8154654 el pueblo mapuche tiene la amplia disposici n para el di logo en la medida que el derecho a la autodeterminaci n el autogobierno mapuche y el territorio sean los ejes fundamentales del di logo
8154655 cesen los allanamientos y la militarizaci n de las comunidades mapuche
8154656 los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche
8154657 el ministerio del interior presente las debidas querellas criminales en contra del gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n por su participaci n en la apolog a a la violencia tales acciones criminales deben presentarse al m s breve plazo de lo contrario ser n las comunidades que concurrir n al tribunal
8154658 intercambio de informaci n para una mayor operatividad en la regi n de la araucan a fue el objetivo de la reuni n de seguridad que convoc el ministerio del interior y que tuvo la participaci n de la polic a civil carabineros la agencia nacional de inteligencia y un representante del fiscal nacional sabas chahu n quien no estuvo presente
8154659 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
8154660 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
8154661 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
8154662 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

8154699 bachelet promulga convenci n internacional sobre derechos de los discapacitados
8154700 nosotros hemos repudiado tremendamente este acto y vamos a aplicar con rigor la ley pero tambi n con la sensatez de no prejuzgar de no partir haciendo cosas locas por manos individuales sino que respetando la institucionalidad que este pa s tiene
8154701 se est trabajando con la canciller a se ha estado trabajando en una especie de acuerdo con el gobierno paname o
8154702 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8154703 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
8154704 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
8154705 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando

8154710 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
8154711 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio

8154766 when we began the development of visonac tm we were seeking to provide a much improved treatment option for patients with moderate to severe acne the results from these two studies clearly highlight that we are well on our way to achieving this goal the fact that we have been able to deliver good efficacy results with visonac tm while at the same time reducing pain and redness will be of major benefit to patients the second study which has demonstrated that we can simplify the overall treatment procedure with visonac tm while delivering equivalent efficacy is expected to help increase the penetration of visonac tm pdt into the overall acne market we look forward to confirming these positive findings in our phase iii program for visonac tm
8154767 da vi startet utviklingen av visonac tm var m let utvikle en bedre behandling for pasienter med moderat til alvorlig grad av akne resultatene fra disse to studiene viser tydelig at vi er kommet mye n rmere dette m let visonac tm viser fremragende effekt samtidig som problemene med smerte og r dhet er l st noe som er en betydelig fordel for denne pasientgruppen i tillegg har vi gjennom den andre studien demonstrert at behandlingsprosedyren med visonac tm kan forenkles uten at det g r ut over behandlingseffekten dette mener vi vil gi visonac tm pdt behandling en bred aksept i markedet vi ser fram til f disse gledelige resultatene bekreftet i v rt fase iii program for visonac tm pdt
8154768 det er et stort medisinsk behov for en ny behandling av pasienter med moderat til alvorlig grad av akne spesielt i usa denne fase iib studien gir god klinisk dokumentasjon for at visonac tm gir h y effekt og forbedret toleranse sammenlignet med n v rende behandlingsalternativer

8154794 los actos de prepotencia y soberbia que realice cualquier representante popular a alg n ciudadano

8154829 venerd pu essere un giorno decisivo per il passaggio di cosmin moti alla lazio
8154830 la lazio sempre stata interessata a moti e in questi ultimi giorni tornata a farsi sentire c la volont di chiudere la trattativa anche se in queste ore la societ biancoceleste impegnata sul fronte stendardo appena ceder il difensore si concentrer su moti
8154831 ha gi iniziato la stagione con la dinamo bucarest e con la nazionale ora aspetta notizie da roma in questi prossimi giorni ne sapremo di pi credo che venerd possa essere il giorno decisivo per chiudere la trattativa
8154832 e stata allestita sicuramente una buona squadra sono arrivati dei rinforzi allaltezza della piazza e c zalayeta che sta recuperando a tempi di record ritengo sia fondamentale nello scacchiere tattico del napoli
8154833 penso di si numericamente ci siamo ci sono pi di 20 giocatori in rosa in ogni ruolo ci sono varie alternative e ci innesca anche tra i calciatori una costruttiva competizione e li sprona ad allenarsi sempre con la giusta concentrazione per un calciatore gli stimoli sono fondamentali
8154834 nel calcio moderno i nostri giovani sono sempre meno apprezzati si tende sempre ad investire su stranieri quando poi la nostra scuola la migliore al mondo bisogna avere coraggio e dare la possibilit ai nostri giovani di esprimersi e di non buttarli nel dimenticatoio anche a vitale spero gli diano la possibilit di giocare senza eccessive pressioni e forse potr anche esplodere come giocatore
8154835 santacroce ha grandi mezzi personalmente lho visto giocare a genova contro la samp e devo dire che in quella circostanza non fece toccare nemmeno un pallone a cassano prestazione da incorniciare devo dire che mi sorprese per il senso di applicazione con il quale affrontava la partita sempre molto agile e soprattutto in anticipo doti che ti portano a vestire presto lazzurro della nazionale a mio avviso santacroce gi sarebbe pronto per questo tipo di discorso
8154836 fu un anno particolare per me non si ripeteranno mai pi scene di quel genere il napoli potr vincere anche altri scudetti ma il primo avr un valore sempre unico si era creato un giusto mix su tutti gli aspetti da quello ambientale a quello tecnico e societario grazie ai nostri tifosi sembrava che giocassimo sempre in casa una macchia azzurra in tutti gli stadi avversari che ci ospitavano mi vengono ancora i brividi quando penso alla magica vittoria a torino contro la juventus erano anni che il napoli non espugnava il campo bianconero nonostante fossimo andati in svantaggio tra di noi cera la consapevolezza di poter ribaltare lincontro in ogni azione maradona ci dava una carica incredibile in campo un vero leader e poi la spinta delle 30000 anime azzurre era qualcosa di eccezionale quando segnai il terzo gol ci fu il tripudio assoluto corsi come un pazzo sotto la curva napoletana se ci penso mi viene la pelle doca unatmosfera unica e irripetibile
8154837 approdai in maglia azzurra con la benedizione di allodi e marino ma il nostro direttore fu colto da un grave malore per questo al suo posto arriv come nuovo ds luciano moggi che port in maglia azzurra altri 4 5 innesti tra cui francini e corradini io non rientravo nei suoi piani cosi scelsi di accettare la proposta del verona guidato dal mister osvaldo bagnoli mio grande estimatore stravedeva per me purtroppo questo il rischio che corre ogni giocatore il giorno prima essere leroe della causa e il giorno dopo essere ceduto al migliore offerente inizialmente avevo un po il dente avvelenato perch sapevo di poter dare ancora molto alla causa azzurra ma con gli anni e con maggiore esperienza ho capito che le cose nel calcio non sempre vanno come speri la mia carriera comunque si chiusa con tante soddisfazioni tra cui una finale in uefa centrata con la maglia della fiorentina
8154838 molti dicevano che diego non si allenava proprio non era affatto cosi anzi aveva uno spirito di dedizione unico in allenamento sempre puntuale e professionale almeno nel periodo nel quale siamo stati compagni di squadra in allenamento faceva cose strabilianti un giocoliere palleggiava con palla da calcio balilla arancia con tutto dico con grande soddisfazione di aver avuto la possibilit di giocare con il pi grande giocatore di calcio della storia
8154839 ho affrontato moltissimi campioni con diego sono stato avversario nel suo primo anno a napoli e non ho assolutamente demeritato rummenigge nelle sue movenze era anche lui un giocatore di livello assoluto in generale forse non ho avuto tanti problemi con i grossi campioni ma piuttosto con calciatori di categorie inferiori verso fine carriera forse ho collezionato anche qualche brutta figura poich non affrontavo le gare con la giusta concentrazione
8154840 a parte santacroce di cui abbiamo parlato prima credo che anche hamsik possa consacrarsi se si esprime a questi livelli il napoli parte gi con una marcia in pi
8154841 per come ha operato in fase di mercato dico genoa ci sono tutte le prerogative per fare grandi cose societ solida calciatori giovani affiancati da talenti come gasbarroni e palladino e soprattutto un tecnico molto preparato come gasperini un allenatore equilibrato che non si deprime di fronte alle difficolt e che garantisce alla societ sempre continuit nei risultati

8154848 we probably have between 1 500 and 2 000 trees
8154849 this study shows a consistent 20 increase in the risk of diabetes
8154850 it is important to stress that the reason for this is still not understood although it is possible that the caesarean section itself is responsible perhaps because babies born via that method are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
8154851 type 1 diabetes in childhood has become more prevalent across europe recently and the rate of this increase suggests that environmental factors are the cause
8154852 however despite much investigation these actual factors remain largely unknown
8154853 the findings of this study indicate that the way a baby is delivered could affect how likely it is to develop this condition later in life
8154854 since 1978 more than 80 cases of lead poisoning associated with ayurvedic medicine use have been reported worldwide
8154855 this study highlights the need for congress to revisit the way dietary supplements are regulated in the us
8154856 our first priority must be the safety of the public herbs and supplements with high levels of lead mercury and arsenic should not be available for sale on the internet or elsewhere
8154857 the medicines which are supposed to cure sickness should not promote another illness due to the presence of toxic materials such as lead
8154858 strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements

8154957 but now we see animals as very precious they are a life support to many
8154958 this directive was very much needed for the mara but it should have been targeted only at the protected area because a blanket freeze is going to put into question the development of responsible conservancies

8154976 a classic example of overloading a pressure sensor is known as the water hammer phenomenon this occurs when a fast moving fluid is suddenly stopped by the closing of a valve the fluid has momentum that is suddenly arrested which causes a minute stretching of the vessel in which the fluid is constrained this stretching generates a pressure spike that can damage a pressure sensor

8155016 we have to focus this is not the type of game where you wake up friday morning and say now i have to focus
8155017 guys dont have the same type of energy level they have at home
8155018 but most of them know theyre not here to make it rich
8155019 they will be tempted there are people out there who are all over those guys
8155020 i compliment mendenhall and rose for what they are doing here as long as it lasts
8155021 i would have been out of a job within a few years if id gone to detroit
8155022 its not so much that were trying to measure up against anyone else
8155023 what i try to do is keep in communication with coaches to keep them coaching here they are good coaches who could undoubtedly make more money elsewhere and someday that might happen
8155024 one theres a notion that some portion of your time needs to be service in that is implied some sacrifice relative to what you might get elsewhere second they want to be fair and give sufficient for your needs third something unique over the past four or five years theres a willingness to entertain and discuss what the market is like out there
8155025 as we talk its not me me me its we we we
8155026 with what were doing here at an lds church owned school its probably not appropriate to pay a coach 2 million but byu president cecil samuelson has been supportive
8155027 the only way i can look at it is are coaches happy here thats an ongoing thing we keep talking

8155038 i never had a chance to do one scene the way it was written or the way i wanted it to be the script wasnt respected bad producers bad partners it was a terrible experience
8155039 weve been very good at recovering and coming back the next day thats what i expect this team to do
8155040 five runs seven runs you never know ive seen it before its not the first time this team never gives up especially here this bandbox here is the perfect place for them to play
8155041 for me personally it was a long night i pretty much screwed it up any way you can screw it up
8155042 rodriguez was in a position where one pitch could turn the whole game around
8155043 i left men all over the field tonight you can put it on me but im going to help the team win a lot of games too
8155044 maybe hes pressing a little bit but i cant speak for him

8155049 going back to 1999 john mccain did an interview with the san francisco chronicle saying that overturning roe v wade would not make any sense because then women would have to have illegal abortions
8155050 john mccain believes roe v wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned and as president he will nominate judges who understand that courts should not be in the business of legislating from the bench
8155051 right now there are still some wounds from the primary season
8155052 and clearly there are some clinton supporters who do match up demographically with mccain not necessarily on issues but blue collar voters in some of the industrial states these are voters that mccain is obviously trying to attract and some of them may stay with him with mccain but the number of clinton supporters particularly those at the convention who are strong democrats are likely to move obamas way slowly but perceptively as the campaign continues
8155053 no self respecting woman should wish or work for the success of a party that ignores her thats by susan b anthony
8155054 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
8155055 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
8155056 the closer he gets to george bush and the more obama can put him in bushs corner the harder it will be for those voters to stay with mccain
8155057 obamas people understand that so right now clearly joe biden is going to be sent out to try to bring those voters home to the democrats
8155058 our company and especially our radio division irie jam radio has a long history of participation in track amp field athletics and when we looked at the jaw dropping gravity defying performances in beijing it was really the logical move to dedicate this years festival to our athletes

8155060 in our statement we recorded our fundamental position that the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo contradicts resolution 1244 russia india and china encourage belgrade and pristina to resume talks within the framework of international law and hope they reach an agreement on all problems of that serbian territory

8155087 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term lines of credit with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses
8155088 there are so many different types of combination blocks that you perform as an offensive line and you have to have trust and chemistry with those around you in order to have success
8155089 ultimately you have to be able to trust that the guy next to you is going to do his job because it affects everybody on the line
8155090 with how complex defenses are there are often times when you dont have time to make the call
8155091 defenses are so into trying to trick you and confuse you you have to make your reads basically when the ball is snapped and you have to trust that the guy next to you is on the same page and youll block the play appropriately
8155092 you learn to trust the guy next to you so you can try to cheat certain protections
8155093 like if its a slide protection i can really go out and be more aggressive on the defensive end knowing that if i overset him i have help inside
8155094 but i think ultimately you have to be able to play together on the field and you develop that trust through practice and repetition and game experience
8155095 the brutality perpetrated by the indian administration is a challenge to international conscience the international community should use its diplomatic pressure to get the brutalities halted in kashmir and letting the people to raise voice for their long denied rights
8155096 the indian government is crushing the voice and sentiment for freedom of the common masses by using ruthless force against them
8155097 our kids are starving no relaxation in curfew has made our life miserable
8155098 in no place in the world is such a harsh and brutal curfew imposed
8155099 the members of international community should act immediately to stop violation of these basic human rights which are enshrined in the un charter and universally practiced in the civilized world
8155100 but any just and fair resolution of the kashmir dispute has to come in an environment free of suppression violence and the sword of draconian laws as it has to take into account the wishes of kashmiri people the influential world capitals know this very well form other recent and past international conflict situations that bringing peace to south asia and the world lies in a fair settlement of the dispute

8155114 this function inherently bears risks since not all enterprises actually become successful and quite a number of them ultimately flame out in the same way that there is no guarantee that every business will end up profitable there is no certainty that dbp will not sustain losses resulting from its loan transactions with a particular company it would be foolhardy to impute criminal liability against the dbp officers because of the damage sustained from such unsuccessful loan transactions
8155115 bad business judgment on the part of the dbp officers does not necessarily translate to criminal liability
8155116 what cannot be denied is that dbp as the new owner of midland cement indirectly assumed responsibility for the outstanding obligations of the company it could thus not allow midland cement to simply flounder without causing prejudice to its own interests
8155117 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election

8155122 i think it was a good match to start off with
8155123 i had never seen my opponent before that was the tricky part i thought the other guy played good for the pressure he was under

8155212 wir brauchen keine pr sidenten der der vergangenheit verhaftet ist
8155213 barack obama ist eine charmante und anst ndige pers nlichkeit mit einer liebenswerten familie aber er ist nicht bereit f r die pr sidentschaft
8155214 i want to thank you for recognizing the times that we are in
8155215 wir stehen solchen gro fusionen nat rlich kritisch und ablehnend gegen ber
8155216 we created some pretty good opportunities but we are not cashing in on them
8155217 they get goodwill they get access and they build relationships
8155218 theyre covering all bases theyre making sure they have input with whoever wins
8155219 im sure mr hoyer didnt even know who the sponsor was
8155220 their experience in financial services will be of great benefit to rbs given the increasingly diversified and internatoinal nature of our powerful banking franchise
8155221 i wont do this job for ever but right now you will find me extremely galvanised to do the task at hand
8155222 si bien tanto el rodeo como las domaduras tuvieron su origen en actividades ligadas propiamente a la agricultura conteo y adiestramiento de los caballos y reses hoy en d a no s lo ya no tienen ninguna raz n de ser sino que se mantienen exclusivamente por el beneficio econ mico que de ellas extraen los recintos los organizadores los municipios etc
8155223 ich halte die risiken der politischen szenarien in hessen f r unvertretbar
8155224 wird das sie selbst die spd in hessen und die bundes spd vor der bundestagswahl schwer besch digen
8155225 ist sie abh ngig von der linken und den traumata des herrn lafontaine sie begibt sich in die h nde einer partei die einfluss ohne verantwortung ohne jede verpflichtung h tte die w chentlich daf r sorgen kann dass regierungsf higkeit wieder verloren geht
8155226 at this stage were looking at 13 victims and were following up those lines of inquiry at the moment
8155227 they got a group between eight and 12 of us together and theyd just start chanting and i would wake up during these sessions and see what was going on
8155228 the families have accepted compensation payments they have to accept the money because the police can be very terrifying
8155229 when they accept the money they are told to keep quiet we have all been told not to accept interviews with the media
8155230 it is not convenient for me to speak to you now please dont call
8155231 it is clear that poor construction was a problem why didnt other buildings here collapse
8155232 after he collected data on collapsed schools according to his wife authorities have not commented on his case
8155233 we have to be thankful to the media for their concern
8155234 because of the reports the situation here has ended much better than it would have otherwise
8155235 it is a conspiracy to push the city into widespread street riots
8155236 the secular credentials of my government are well established and need no explaining my governments credentials regarding according full professional autonomy to the police and absence of any political interference in the functioning of the police also need no clarification
8155237 of course why not if there is a suspension of military cooperation this is military cooperation
8155238 no one with common sense can expect to co operate with russia in one part of the world while acting against it in another
8155239 its not in russias interests for nato to be defeated and leave behind all these problems
8155240 wed prefer nato to complete its job and then leave this unnatural geography
8155241 but at the same time well be the last ones to moan about natos departure
8155242 det er neppe mulig f med seg alle krumspringene i markedet men det er fullt mulig sl konsensus og markedet ved ta i bruk massenes visdom
8155243 da jeg f rste gang vurderte amerikanske sjef konomers prestasjoner kom jeg p ideen sammenligne de nyeste estimatene for n enkelt makro konomisk hendelse med de tidligst innkomne estimatene det er nemlig slik at noen sjef konomer offentliggj r sine estimater tidligere enn andre min tanke var at det ville l nne seg h re mest p de nyeste sp dommene
8155244 dette viser at makro konomene suger til seg ny informasjon og endrer forventningene sine som f lge av informasjonsstr mmen

8155268 maar ik hoop dat ik toch nog wat rondjes kan winnen
8155269 het wordt allemaal erg gehypet door de pers het is gewoon een goed verhaal als er ruzie is
8155270 als puntje bij paaltje komt draaien de meeste mensen weer bij iedereen weet hoe belangrijk het is dat er weer een democraat in het witte huis komt
8155271 zijn we klaar voor eenheid zijn we klaar voor de overwinning
8155272 werk net zo hard voor obama als jullie voor mij hebben gedaan
8155273 al die teleurgestelden zouden als ze echt voor hillary zijn er juist voor moeten zorgen dat obama op 4 november wint
8155274 toen hij in 1968 werd vermoord een paar maanden na de moord op martin luther king verloor amerika alle hoop bobby vocht voor mensen voor wie eigenlijk nooit gevochten was de onderklasse de zwarte bevolking nu zie je dat mensen die veertig jaar niet in de politiek ge nteresseerd waren weer ge nspireerd raken dat er iets kan veranderen met barack obama dat er weer hoop is op verandering
8155275 melbourne is not a theme park city but i do see it as embracing outdoor entertainment theres a strong dining out culture in melbourne and it the wheel fits well into that early evening context
8155276 the tourism market here is quite different you have the highest friends and relatives market with about 20 of tourists here to visit family people love showing off their city to their visitors and the wheel is perfect for that
8155277 think of the difference between a glider and a 747 its very gentle quiet almost a bit surreal you dont even notice you are ascending until you get to the top and start descending
8155278 people are always looking for the next big thing the next big thrill
8155279 niet zoveel hij heeft wel een aantal nieuwe trainingsvormen ingevoerd maar de grote lijn is hetzelfde wat vooral opvalt is zijn enthousiasme dat werkt aanstekelijk je kunt een dooie drol voor de groep zetten of een man die je voortdurend prikkelt dan heb ik echt liever dat laatste fred rutten was ook enthousiast maar op een andere manier wat zakelijker ik heb een heel goed gevoel bij nieuwe trainer
8155280 de trainer maakt vanaf de eerste dag een goede indruk op mij de laatste tijd bemoeit hij zich wat meer met de trainingen dan in het begin toen observeerde hij vooral negentig procent van alle arbeid die wij verrichten is hetzelfde gebleven trainer ten hag en de rest van de staf zijn er nog en dat zie je terug daar komt nog eens bij dat er onder rutten een bepaalde professionaliteit in de groep is gekomen waardoor de spelers elkaar scherp houden
8155281 ik denk dat we net zo sterk zijn de achterhoede is grotendeels hetzelfde en voorin is er niets veranderd ons middenveld ziet er wat anders uit maar tegen arsenal heeft iedereen kunnen zien dat ook dit middenveld heel goed kan voetballen we hebben vorig seizoen n kleine dip gehad als we die nu weten te voorkomen dan kunnen we om de prijzen gaan spelen en moet europees voetbal haalbaar zijn
8155282 ik vind ons op dit moment nog wat wisselvallig in bepaalde gedeelten van wedstrijden laten we zien dat we heel goed kunnen voetballen maar er zijn ook momenten in wedstrijden dat we de weg kwijt zijn en dat moet eruit al moet ik wel zeggen dat we dat vorig jaar rond deze tijd ook hadden ik vind dat we nog steeds een goed elftal hebben we zijn ons middenveld kwijt geraakt en daar hebben we spelers met andere kwaliteiten voor teruggekregen ze zijn anders maar ik denk zeker dat zij niet minder zijn
8155283 het klopt niet dat ik meteen na de wedstrijd heb geroepen dat het geen zin meer heeft om naar londen te gaan zo heb ik het niet verwoord wat wel klopt is dat ik toen heel erg teleurgesteld was omdat we heel goed hadden gespeeld maar toch met lege handen stonden we spelen hier wel voor zestigduizend mensen en een heleboel twente supporters die met ons mee zijn gekomen die mensen verdienen een sterk en gemotiveerd twente in arnhem hebben we ook bewezen dat we het arsenal heel lastig kunnen maken dan kun je wel zeggen dat zij niet op hun sterkst waren maar met het materiaal dat ze op het veld hadden staan hadden ze ons nog moeten overklassen en dat is zeker niet gebeurd integendeel zelfs
8155284 abm recognizing the enormous opportunities in todays global marketplace and its members needs is positioning itself to become the global b to b association
8155285 we are delighted to offer media members the opportunity to experience indias b to b community first hand much like we did in china in late 2006 bringing industry leaders together for a collective sharing of information ideas and challenges and we are thrilled to be working with both bpa worldwide and cross border media on this exciting indian venture abms journeys abroad support our strategic initiative to help our members grow globally and become the global business information association
8155286 given the economic vibrancy that is india and with the opening of media to foreign investment
8155287 there are great opportunities for foreign media firms in the b to b sector to collaborate with their counterparts in india we have been in contact with publishers in india interested in best business practices and sharing their experiences with peers in their b to b markets taking a delegation of our publishing members from around the globe who have an interest in doing business in india will result in precisely that as bpa worldwide is the largest global non profit organization tasked with auditing media in more than 30 countries our incoming indian publishers may have an interest in reciprocating and visiting other countries in which they may have an interest in expanding their brands
8155288 i am particularly impressed with the enthusiasm expressed by indian publishers who have pledged full support by way of sponsorships
8155289 in fact i see 2009 as a turning point in indias b to b publishing industry

8155292 these are different products outside of belkin and targis who know and do their markets very well
8155293 lap top bag prices start from 69 95 and resellers are looking at 40 percent floor margin i want a reseller that understands customers who purchase it as a fashion accessory thats why i dont want the products sold through any retailer
8155294 if i get a request for a special order from a reseller i want to make sure a design team is at hand to draw up the product which means we can then get samples and orders out quickly
8155295 to be successful in this highly competitive market vendors need to not only address current security threats and challenges but also constantly innovate and improve their offerings and go to market strategies
8155296 specifically key growth opportunities for vendors exist in ipc and web security as well as in offering hybrid security models combining on premise and services hosted in the cloud
8155297 enabling im and other types of web 2 0 communication can bring great benefits to companies but it departments need to consider the risks involved and make sure that security policy control and compliance are introduced as standard best practice

8155333 there was a gap along the iraq and syrian border and we pushed up dirt to connect the northern and southern edges of the berm
8155334 we were out there pushing up dirt to create obstacles for people crossing the border illegally
8155335 this mission was important because now we can control the flow of people coming in and out of the country
8155336 the berm allows the border to be better controlled making it better for all the citizens of iraq
8155337 its not just going to help us but its going to help the iraqi government iraqi army and police
8155338 it will let them do a lot more without them having to worry about foreign fighters coming across the border
8155339 its a good thing because were helping out everyone in the big picture of things
8155340 its a good success story for the iraqi government and the iraqi people
8155341 the economic health of galveston is pretty sturdy but we have a sense that people are more pinched by the cost of food and fuel
8155342 we want people to recognize what it has done in the past to touch the community
8155343 were convinced people will see these good things happening around them and be willing to come back this year to support the campaign

8155351 and the minister has yet to make a determination on this proposal
8155352 so obviously some of the issues you raised may be amongst those the minister will have to consider in the context of that epbc consideration
8155353 it is the case that the government and this minister are committed to proper and transparent administration of the epbc act
8155354 the ministers decision is within the context of the statutory framework and he has to have regard to issues under the act accordingly
8155355 ive met not only with the hia but the also the master builders association the unions and other construction industry players
8155356 to me its become evident that the hia claims are at variance with the views of others within the industry so at this point im seeking advice to test the voracity of the hia claims
8155357 it certainly it is a national standard which had already been adopted by many businesses in south australia and is already in place in most other australian states
8155358 i think well be able to strengthen legislation and apply bandaid solutions to give us breathing space but ultimately if you want to preserve koalas and everything we value such as less crowded beaches and roads then the population has to be stabilised
8155359 i am concerned that the state government is trying to manipulate the national strategy by being seen to be doing something about the dire state of koalas in queensland
8155360 ive read 700 post mortems of urban koalas and i can tell you a lot of these koalas are simply starving to death
8155361 its true that many of the problems that plague the wrestling industry today existed back then as well
8155362 unlike the nwa territories which kept a wrestler within driving distance of his family at most times these international brands sent their wrestlers from one end of the continent to the other this in effect put an end to the camaraderie that had existed in the territories no longer were wrestlers members of a freewheeling carnie brotherhood a traveling biker gang now they were interchangeable cogs within a heavily bureaucratic corporate behemoth cowering in their cubicles in fear of the next downsizing
8155363 he said he is feeling better and is ready to go home
8155364 he was not totally unconscious but it was hurting him he was moving his arms when they took him away on the stretcher
8155365 a witness near him saw what he believed was a spark of electricity between him and the tool he was reaching for
8155366 a few guys saw it but im not sure if it hit him or right beside him
8155367 one of the guys said it hit the top of his head but i didnt see his shoes messed up
8155368 i knew it hit somewhere i could tell it was close then everybody started yelling and i ran over there
8155369 part of the roof was knocked off and it landed on braniff road and knocked down some power lines

8155375 we know so far nothing but it is possible that there is collusion at the highest level of which we are still not informed
8155376 it does and i put it this way we believe that investment in our own intellectual properties as particularly phil harrison and i tried to do in the last five years with singstar or with the getaway or with buzz these are ours we can put them in our cupboard
8155377 we have to accept more and more that platform holders themselves cannot have exclusives unless theyre given millions and millions of dollars not to develop a particular game for one particular platform
8155378 but for developers and you could take someone like quantic dream for example a great game it takes a lot of time to develop they need a little bit of funding external development in exchange its exclusive that works so exclusivity possibly with developers is more likely that exclusivity with publishers

8155383 we just want to make sure those guys are given a chance to put their best foot forward
8155384 ive seen guys step forward and you say hey we cant deny that guy
8155385 thats all they want they just want an opportunity to be able to show as long as theyve been given a chance
8155386 im not sure if were down to a coin flip
8155387 obviously they want to give a good accounting of themselves whether they are handing it off or whether they are making a play on a naked or a screen or a drop back pass
8155388 i just want to see where they are with our system
8155389 its hard to come right in and get thrown out there and youre awesome
8155390 i think i can get so much better i definitely feel good about what ive done im not satisfied or content with the way things have gone but its a great opportunity for me to be around these coaches and learn from them and the quarterbacks
8155391 hes still bright eyed and likes getting around the offensive and defensive linemen
8155392 we want to widen the service tax base and pay special attention to these sections which are neither registered with us nor pay service tax the ground work has already been done with regard to this and we expect to complete the process soon
8155393 they have a huge revenue potential but at present are escaping the tax net
8155394 voters seem to take a dim view of officials breaking the law and it usually gets resolved at the next election
8155395 i believe i can and should finish out my term thats where i stand right now but bottom line theres a lot to consider here ive let a lot of people down
8155396 i made a mistake in thinking i hadnt had too much to drink before getting behind the wheel i would not have driven had i thought i was over the limit but thats a mistake im going to pay the consequences for
8155397 beyond that i am working and making progress in my personal life i think thats all that needs to be said on that
8155398 i have had my struggles with drinking but ive made pretty big strides and i am going to reinitiate counseling
8155399 i would hope he would resign on his own and thats what i told him myself
8155400 i told i would hope you take steps to take care of yourself and get some help
8155401 i feel for him and my heart goes out to him but at the same time youve committed to representing the people and when you drink and drive you put people in harms way
8155402 we all like him hes a very intelligent guy but i think it would be appropriate for him to resign and get help for himself
8155403 we just wanted to give our institutions a heads up that our examiners are going to be focusing on this area
8155404 reducing or freezing credit lines may be a prudent response for lenders managing their risks
8155405 but for consumers who use home equity lines to pay for major purchases or to pay off higher priced credit having their source of funding reduced can result in significant financial hardship

8155409 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8155410 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8155411 but in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president
8155412 there is no way in hell he should have been deployed the army saw him as just another set of boots on the ground
8155413 from the second tour on he changed 180 degrees three deployments is two too many the army took my husband from me the army destroyed my husband
8155414 army leaders are fully aware that repeated deployments have led to increased distress and anxiety for both soldiers and their families
8155415 there appears to be a direct relationship between the incidence of suicide and the number of deployments which of course is no surprise
8155416 the army is making great strides in treating soldiers with post traumatic psychological symptoms as well as decreasing the stigma associated with treatment for these symptoms
8155417 were not here to make you better were here to make you deployable
8155418 everyone treats you like crap theres a huge stigma to asking for help
8155419 but the real problem is the ptsd the real problem is the mental health condition
8155420 now making them better may mean taking them from a non deployable to a deployable status obviously theres a war going on but the goal is making them better
8155421 anything that burned reminded him of the sights and sounds of picking up bodies at the pentagon
8155422 chad would get very severe migraines that would knock him to his knees
8155423 he served his country for 12 years he went through more hell in one year than you and i will in a lifetime
8155424 the army takes suicide prevention very seriously we are honor bound to ensure we do everything possible to minimize potential risks
8155425 just had to sit and talk to someone over a tv
8155426 i thought well if thats how theyre going to treat you at least youre talking to someone
8155427 i know that he was by himself he sat in his room and played a video game
8155428 the outcome as well as patient satisfaction was the same
8155429 she was telling people she was going to kill herself
8155430 she had evidently told people about the history of abuse
8155431 she was laughing and singing she was sent with a male to the chaplain the chaplain couldnt speak very good english told her to start obeying orders it was a series of people who could have done something better
8155432 friendly fire because they failed to take care of a fellow soldier
8155433 he just kept doing it he was in love with her she was trying to get away from him
8155434 he verbally and physically assaulted her it was reported to the higher command
8155435 he was e mailing her and e mailing her and e mailing her she wouldnt answer his e mails he went into her room killed her and then he killed himself
8155436 the last time he assaulted her he drove around looking for her that was probably a week or two before he killed her
8155437 i asked after the second assault what did yall do then the only thing they told me was a lot of mistakes were made
8155438 chaplains are constantly working to prevent suicide at every level most importantly at the soldier level
8155439 caution is warranted in beginning changing stopping and or continuing
8155440 they sent him to anger management classes feeling somewhat deserted by his father he was so young they had also put him in suicide watch in boot camp
8155441 that is a suicidal medicine especially with teens i was livid i just couldnt believe they put him on prozac
8155442 both prozac and paxil are in the class of medications called ssris which are a very safe category of antidepressants
8155443 and they put me on something else they changed my medicine gave me a week of stress management
8155444 i dont think he should have ever been sent there why would you deploy someone who was a danger to himself and maybe others when they know its just unacceptable pushing them out there
8155445 lack of adequate staffing of nurses and a serious lack of qualified physicians to provide medical care to inmates
8155446 deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of plaintiff and others
8155447 we are disappointed and the county is going to reserve any comment on the case until we talk to the commissioners court about various options for appeal
8155448 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
8155449 any democrat or republican who said they were going to support us on health care or free choice and turns against us is going to paint a target
8155450 were not going to just win this election and hope barack obama does well people want something to happen
8155451 faltering economy and the increased cost of fuel have severely impacted the u s automotive industry
8155452 the declining automaker production volumes and significant changes in vehicle segment mix in the u s have reduced cadence innovations revenues during a period of rapidly increasing materials costs this combination of sky rocketing material costs and quickly deteriorating revenue precipitated todays filing for protection
8155453 were in the middle of a sale process and filing for bankruptcy is something we had to do to continue operations
8155454 the cause and effect in this situation is obvious and the cause is a clear set of external factors collapsing revenue and material costs increasing at double digit rates
8155455 we find the need to file for bankruptcy protection as a dreadful development particularly given the commendable efforts of our workforce and the many sacrifices the cadence innovation team has made the reality is that this groundswell of external factors and environmental change exceeds the flexibility of our business model
8155456 scientist finds way to convert old cars to run on cold fusion for 10 new cars exhaust is pure water and food new cold fusion cars cause random sterilization in people government pre approves the technology also driving car makes people smarter and reduces apathy
8155457 i heard this padlock being smashed and looked out to see a man wearing a white t shirt make off over a fence and down the street
8155458 i would have thought they should have been able to catch a man in a white t shirt as there couldnt have been many running about the area at five in the morning
8155459 when we got the text i just thought oh my god is this how cambridgeshire police respond to a 999 call
8155460 it just gives burglars the idea that they can get away with it because the police arent going to send anyone out
8155461 what message does that send to my neighbours here is it just pointless to call police if you see someone breaking in to a house
8155462 to text the person who calls and ask for the person to investigate what had been stolen broken into and who did it is incredible
8155463 lloyd following on from your call earlier on to the police please can you contact us if you are able to establish what has been stolen and where from
8155464 at this time were struggling to get the police to attend general calls for service many thanks
8155465 what is totally unbelievable was that we were under the impression that this type of crime came under the 999
8155466 we were totally gobsmacked and disgusted that this text was sent out an hour later to us
8155467 due to the number of emergency calls at that time we were unable to send an officer straight to the scene
8155468 all calls have to be graded by their urgency and unfortunately at this time there were a number of incidents including reports of disorder and assaults which police were attending
8155469 in 1982 having sold his jazz bar to devote himself to writing murakami began running to keep fit a year later hed completed a solo course from athens to marathon and now after dozens of such races not to mention triathlons and a dozen critically acclaimed books he reflects upon the influence the sport has had on his life and even more important on his writing
8155470 equal parts training log travelogue and reminiscence this revealing memoir covers his four month preparation for the 2005 new york city marathon and takes us to places ranging from tokyos jingu gaien gardens where he once shared the course with an olympian to the charles river in boston among young women who outpace him through this marvelous lens of sport emerges a panorama of memories and insights the eureka moment when he decided to become a writer his greatest triumphs and disappointments his passion for vintage lps and the experience after fifty of seeing his race times improve and then fall back
8155471 ive always wanted to do rural medicine which is why im applying to the cornhusker school of medicine etc
8155472 he was a tremendous athlete and a very hard worker
8155473 when you have that combination you have a chance to be great
8155474 all the people i wanted to be around were back here thats why i came back to be around the people who cared about me
8155475 id stay at my best friend matts and hed wake up in the morning chancellor you got class today you going to get up i didnt really think about it too much then but he was making me feel bad i didnt really think about what i was doing
8155476 he loved football but he had a lot of stuff going on in life he wanted to take a little break and really he needed to find himself
8155477 it wasnt the fear of disappointing them but like they kept saying as long as you do what you know you can do well always be supportive as long as youre doing what is right and handling your business but i knew i hadnt handled my business
8155478 even when i started working i wasnt pulling myself out of the funk it was just you have to do something
8155479 you cant just be sitting around doing absolutely nothing youve at least got to carry your weight
8155480 at that time i know he was thinking i dont want to do this the rest of my life
8155481 before i could even talk to coach i had to get back in school i knew that and i just started
8155482 he kept battling and kept doing the things to put himself back to being a member of this team because its something he very desperately wanted to do
8155483 and we held the door open for him to do that
8155484 willingham said to take care of school so i took care of my classes and made sure i was eligible then he finally let me talk with coach tim lappano and charlie baggett
8155485 they laid out the opportunities and said we needed to hit this thing running
8155486 they wanted people to bust their butts and get after it and i said i was willing to do whatever it takes
8155487 hell get his face on you in the running game and he could really help on special teams
8155488 hes still going through that period of getting readjusted to the system and catching up but i think just the mere fact that he fought to get back here points to that that he understands clearly that this is it
8155489 ive been seeing this for so long me coming back its like i finally get a chance to finish what i started
8155490 i might be two steps behind where i want to be but you have to take the opportunity that presents itself and its just refreshing to have that chance
8155491 and i pretty much screwed it up any way you can screw it up
8155492 hes going to be pretty excited for me and i got to give him this he plays fantasy baseball and i was in his lineup today hes probably the only guy in fantasy baseball anywhere who actually played me
8155493 but ill probably say something like we got your yankees tonight
8155494 theyre loud i killed the rally no one is more frustrated than me everyone is desperate for wins on a night like tonight i was booing myself
8155495 though i thought ive had better years maybe it was a down year in the international league
8155496 i threw a good changeup in a good count to bailey i think his name is bailey and he rolled it right down the line and off the bag
8155497 he doesnt know me its obvious my first two at bats he was throwing all fastballs and it was working he was throwing me in in in
8155498 im just wishing my family wasnt watching the game then i could tell them that i had two line drive hits
8155499 the defensive line i think if we are healthy is in better shape than i thought we might be
8155500 the only concern is that off and on they havent all been healthy at the same time
8155501 i dont think we have enough energy or are playing with enough enthusiasm
8155502 were not making anything happen right now weve got to make things happen not sit back
8155503 he used his changeup well pitched on the inner half of the plate very well and gave our guys a chance to get going offensively
8155504 we had to leave the house before it got worse
8155505 most indications are that gustav will be an extremely dangerous hurricane in the northwestern caribbean sea in a few days
8155506 im not too happy about it because i needed to get paid today
8155507 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came
8155508 our guys battled kept coming back but it wasnt easy
8155509 it really wasnt one of our better games but its in the win column and give these guys credit for really staying after it
8155510 sotos a clutch hitter with men on base he bears down
8155511 this is just something weve been doing over the past month playing good teams and being in there and havent been able to get the big hit or the big hold or save
8155512 he just needs to get back to his family and hell come back when he can
8155513 well keep doing it until we find the right way

8155517 if you get into that last hour and youre on time youve got a pretty good chance of getting done what you need to get done
8155518 theres a dialogue between the convention planners and the television network producers and a part of that dialogue is whos going to speak when keeping that dialogue open and managing the time so you can have the people at the podium when you say theyre going to be there is very important and mike berman taught me that
8155519 if youre running late or if something comes up that causes the schedule to go over youre the person who goes up to someone and says youre not speaking tonight
8155520 that has not happened at this convention but it usually happens once or twice
8155521 there comes a time when other people deserve a chance to have all the fun that ive had
8155522 you cant lose games like that when youre running out of time you cant let games like that get away
8155523 its a tough loss but there are still plenty of games to play
8155524 we had a lot of fun today we didnt have any pressure
8155525 i made some petty good pitches my fastballs kind of starting to get there the velocitys starting to come back a little bit i felt pretty comfortable

8155591 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever because he thinks americans overall are better off thanks to president bush

8155632 members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening
8155633 the timing and extent of any change in policy stance would depend on evolving economic and financial developments and the implications for the outlook for economic growth and inflation
8155634 worried about the possibility that core inflation might fail to moderate next year unless the stance of monetary policy was tightened sooner than currently anticipated by financial markets
8155635 the labor market continued to weaken significantly financial conditions remained unfavorable consumer and business confidence was downbeat and manufacturing activity was contracting
8155636 he saw a greater risk to the economy from upward pressures on inflation

8155690 the other party has tabled an agenda an economic agenda that runs diametrically opposed to everything that this government stands for
8155691 so i think you really have increasingly in parliament two visions of where we should be leading the country particularly during challenging economic times and obviously thats something im going to have to reflect on
8155692 has now in fact made it impossible for himself and his party to work with the government on finding common ground
8155693 he is breaking his word because he knows he has a fixed election date to respect
8155694 they are full of contradictions they claim that we need to agree with their agenda on the phone when nobody knows which agenda he is talking about

8155696 five years ago there were lots and lots of people whod never heard of a churro and many of the people who did know what one was had had one at disneyland or at a ballpark

8155729 at the halfway mark of the season we probably thought that we were going to play finals the way we were going
8155730 we had a bit of an easier run you could probably say after our first half and thats when we struggled a bit to finish those games off
8155731 id have to say wed be pretty disappointed with the way we finished off the year
8155732 we still knew we had a job to do and we had to win the games to do that but we certainly did drop off towards the end of the season
8155733 if we get away with a win this week well miss out on the finals but well go into next year with a bit of confidence
8155734 next time we play sydney well have a bit of confidence as well knowing we can knock them off

8155768 add all these issues together you still find that 10 years after being in government the health crisis continues to roll out unfortunately day in day out
8155769 im not much of a politician but i do know that the government of the day has a community service obligation to look after all queenslanders and that goes for the little places like aramac with 300 people
8155770 its hardly a hospital now when we havent had a full time doctor there for the last four years because we cant attract a full time doctor there
8155771 what we want to do is find a new model of care that will deliver health services for the people of aramac and stop this charade about pretending that they have a fully functioning hospital because they clearly dont
8155772 winter always is our busiest time but staff sickness hasnt helped on this occasion along with an increase in the number of elderly patients presenting to the hospital

8155774 violenze in india tutta colpa dei missionari che vogliono convertirci
8155775 sono molto preoccupato per la situazione dei cattolici nella mia diocesi e vorrei essere ora l presente purtroppo le violenze anti cristiane sono scoppiate proprio nel momento in cui ero appena giunto qui in kerala per partecipare alla celebrazione dellanniversario dordinazione di un mio confratello che qui svolge la sua missione conto di ripartire oggi stesso o al massimo domani per raggiungere la mia sede vescovile
8155776 tuttavia sottolinea monsignor raphael cheenath il livello di violenza ha compiuto un balzo in avanti mentre allora la rabbia degli estremisti aveva trovato sfogo nella distruzione dei beni dei cattolici ora invece diretta contro le persone il numero delle vittime non ancora definitivo ho ricevuto notizia che ci sono state cinque vittime e numerosi feriti alcuni in gravi condizioni prego dio che tutto questo abbia subito fine e si torni alla ragione nutro il massimo rispetto per i religiosi induisti tra cui anche il leader assassinato e credo che anche tra loro vi siano dei moderati che rispettano il nostro impegno a favore dei poveri non bisogna per tacere che c chi usa il pretesto pseudo religioso per scopi di carattere politico i cattolici dellorissa sono una piccola comunit circa luno per cento della popolazione i nostri fedeli sono tutti per una convivenza pacifica con gli appartenenti agli altri credi e hanno quando possibile buoni rapporti con i vicini induisti
8155777 ho parlato con monsignor babu mi ha riferito che la giovane missionaria laica morta per essere rimasta indietro nelledificio gi in fiamme mentre tutti fuggivano allesterno probabilmente il suo zelo laveva spinta ad accertarsi che tutti i piccoli orfani fossero effettivamente usciti anche padre eduard rimasto ustionato per lo stesso motivo oltre alle ustioni stato picchiato con ferocia dagli estremisti induisti che avevano appiccato il rogo i bambini insieme ad alcune suore si sono probabilmente nascosti nelle piantagioni delle vicinanze tuttavia finora non posso dire nulla di preciso sulla loro sorte prego dio che protegga queste vite innocenti
8155778 sicuramente fuggito per scampare alla folla di fanatici induisti radunatasi allesterno delledificio per appiccare il fuoco ho avuto con lui una concitata conversazione telefonica mi ha descritto con angosciate parole levolversi degli eventi gli ho raccomandato di pregare intensamente e di mettersi in salvo per quanto ne so il centro pastorale ha subito danni gravissimi forse irrimediabili questa era unopera che era costata tanti sacrifici ai fedeli delle mia diocesi eravamo molto orgogliosi dellopera realizzata
8155779 ho idee precise a proposito afferma larcivescovo di cuttack bhubaneswar ci sono forze ultra conservatrici che usano pretesti pseudo religiosi come le presunte conversioni forzate per imporre il loro controllo sulla societ le folle li seguono in buona fede spesso manipolate da false informazioni noi cristiani i cattolici in particolare veniamo perseguitati soprattutto per il nostro impegno sociale in favore dei pi poveri mi sembra evidente che c chi ha interesse a tenere i contadini e i fuori casta in uno stato di perenne soggezione noi cattolici non abbiamo mai fatto opera di proselitismo ma abbiamo sempre dato il buon esempio nelle opere assistenziali penso che per questi personaggi che soffiano sul fuoco questo nostro atteggiamento caritatevole sia unimperdonabile colpa

8155787 sir donald bradman was indeed a great australian and he remains a great example of australian sporting excellence
8155788 he was the greatest sportsman in any sport and in any era as far as i would be concerned
8155789 it is impossible to imagine an australian national portrait gallery without a portrait of bradman
8155790 we found the abducted japanese man minutes ago he has been shot several times
8155791 we are aware of press reports but are still checking
8155792 and the minister has yet to make a determination on this proposal
8155793 so obviously some of the issues you raised may be amongst those the minister will have to consider in the context of that epbc consideration
8155794 it is the case that the government and this minister are committed to proper and transparent administration of the epbc act
8155795 the ministers decision is within the context of the statutory framework and he has to have regard to issues under the act accordingly
8155796 that bradman made a century on average every time he batted is remarkable in itself but to realise his batting average is virtually twice as high as anyone who played test cricket for any length of time shows why he is one of sports great stories
8155797 of the 2 519 batsmen who have taken the crease in 131 years of test cricket bradman stands alone and untouched
8155798 i am no aware of any other sport which has one competitor so far above any other performer
8155799 violenze in india tutta colpa dei missionari che vogliono convertirci
8155800 the game requests the player to be a hero and save black balloons by performing a number of energy saving actions such as switching off lights and appliances before the snowman melts because of the effects of climate change
8155801 we have designed this game to appeal to late primary school and early secondary school students but i think lots of adults may also enjoy playing it
8155802 the game really gives kids the understanding and empowers them by letting them know that their individual actions can reduce their impact on climate change
8155803 im happy with the kind of films i am getting and yes the sex symbol tag that i had got after julie is fading
8155804 i am comfortable doing about four films a year unless i get burnt out and totally exhausted i think i will continue doing so

8155806 pakistanis will cash in on it it serves their interest to liven up the issue they have already livened up the border with ceasefire violations and increasing instances of cross border firing
8155807 it will be internationalised and questions will be asked in the international fora
8155808 india has succeeded in internationalising the issue after bringing it firmly in the ambit of the bilateral dialogue process its a setback
8155809 kashmir was being discussed in the back channels its now out in the open and will encourage pakistan to make it the main issue in the composite dialogue process
8155810 for the moment they are not taking full advantage of the situation but they will do so
8155811 this is not a military issue any more it is a mass movement kashmir is indias northern ireland its basque problem
8155812 we will solve these issues bilaterally we want to be seen as fair minded as the government defuses the crisis
8155813 violence had declined due to capacity constraints on the part of pakistan due to its internal turmoil and increasing international pressure on pakistan over taliban and terrorism and not because of a change in the governments policy
8155814 we have to be vigilant against pakistans attempts to capitalise on unrest

8155816 mr modis counter request was tell me the story in two lines i told him he immediately agreed then his staff got into action and a date was set

8155818 its very important for us actors to come forward and help a film thats done with sincerity of purpose and has got a message behind it

8155838 it is clear that poor construction was a problem why didnt other buildings here collapse
8155839 we have to be thankful to the media for their concern
8155840 because of the reports the situation here has ended much better than it would have otherwise
8155841 i am ruling out mr peters he simply doesnt have the integrity in my view unless he can somehow change that
8155842 and i have received an explanation which is that he refutes the suggestion
8155843 the fact that a minister is in his or her job is a statement that i have confidence in them
8155844 i think we really need to see the privileges committee work through the issue
8155845 he was behaving tough with a wriggle out clause its not clever its not experienced its not smart and its not wise
8155846 the answer is that they know they are going to lose
8155847 in the early part of this year mr peters held a press conference where he held up a statement and said at no time had he been involved in solicitation or receipt of 100 000 donation that according to mr glenn is factually incorrect
8155848 why it happened who it happened with and what mr glenn said

8155865 if you tell someone in the sports betting field that theyll get promoted sometime in the next year it is not nearly as helpful as saying youll get promoted in 6 months following outstanding performance reviews in your department
8155866 most sports betting companies start with the bottom and work their way up when establishing new levels of corporate responsibility
8155867 and this permeates all the way to upper leadership and helps get rid of the dead wood
8155868 our sports betting company had mediocre work ratings and efficiency but after we developed new ethics and values profits and production explded
8155869 weve noticed that over all performance and output has increased dramatically after implementing a solid corporate mission statement and list of commandments it has really helped these sports betting workers focus their efforts and most importantly believe in what theyre doing
8155870 we have also found that holiday bonuses are very helpful
8155871 when the holidays arrive employees tend to get stressed out and tired easier this is of course attributed to holiday family gatherings purchasing gifts and a tighter family budget in general so by providing sports betting workers with a bonus around the holidays the extra stress they feel melts away and gives rise to genuine gratitude and higher productivity levels
8155872 is one that likes what they do how they do it and why they do it nothing is more important in the sports betting industry than these things and i can speak for my company when i say that establishing these values in the office boosts results tremendously
8155873 many times we get so caught up in the numbers we forget that our business functions on the sheer productivity of our employees
8155874 and when we stop and examine how things actually work on a day to day basis we can find ways of tweaking operation and creating a solid morale for our company
8155875 hes been excellent i thought he was nearly our player last week against the dogs in what he did
8155876 its no coincidence that the team has been running a lot better with him at six
8155877 he finch is a big talker a few of us boys will have to step up and be pretty dominant this week
8155878 it is probably my biggest test this week but as hagesy said ive just got to do the little things ive been doing but be a little bit more dominant because finchys gone
8155879 they give you a lot of confidence when you do something right and theyre into you when you do something wrong
8155880 im really enjoying it first grade now and getting a feel for it
8155881 playing a few games in a row has actually given me a bit more confidence week by week
8155882 it doesnt require surgery hopefully that will settle down and allow him to play the last game but well have to work around that this week

8155896 oh im a freelance dancer and doing some work in beijing for a few weeks
8155897 well i am part of a dance troop and we performed the london segment of the closing ceremony of the beijing olympics
8155898 a concert of this nature is not conducive to teach the younger generation to become good citizens upright and competitive but instead would weaken them morally and mentally
8155899 if the concert organisers do not heed this warning to cancel the concert pas youth will order all muslim youth to turn up and protest the concert in order to prevent it from taking place
8155900 we were told there was going to be a welcome at the airport but we didnt imagine this many people its great to know theres this much support behind us
8155901 it makes you feel pretty special when people go through that sort of effort to come and wish us well at the airport it makes all the hard work so worthwhile
8155902 i love the olympics ive been to two now i just feel like i need to go and finish on a note that im happy with
8155903 i feel like although i gave everything this time i didnt get the results i wanted
8155904 im not even thinking that far let us just enjoy the moment
8155905 trident high school is the high school i went to and to have them up here is fantastic its a long journey for them
8155906 this is sensational its great to have come having achieved a goal
8155907 i remember how i felt in the airport after athens coming home on that flight and it wasnt a good feeling this is much better
8155908 this is overwhelmingly bigger than anything else ive ever been in and i think a neat tribute to the athletes and they deserve it most of them have been just blown away by the sheer size and scope of this
8155909 the support from new zealand right through the games has been unbelievable and this is a real manifestation of it so were really excited and im excited for the team whove worked so hard
8155910 already the team are talking about the athletes who are committed to going on to 2012 athletes like mahe who would have liked gold saying hes got to go back to london to get that gold medal
8155911 theres a whole range of athletes like that who i think because it was a great experience want to go on and have another crack in london

8155919 she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election i thought she was outstanding
8155920 she did everything she needed to do to unify the party
8155921 she made it very clear from the beginning that the way she was going to continue fighting for what she believed in and what she was passionate about was by fighting for sen obama
8155922 she made it very clear to all of us who worked for her that she expected other people to do the same
8155923 i think she was in a very difficult race and she said the things she thought would help her win the election
8155924 in my personal opinion i think it was a little excessive

8155926 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
8155927 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
8155928 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
8155929 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
8155930 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
8155931 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation
8155932 even though pneumococcus is very common until recently no one had realized that it could develop this pilus to reach out and touch a human cell
8155933 oral streptococci which are normally in the mouth and throat have the pilus genetic package and we believe pneumococcus picked it up in the back of the throat we decided to look at how the bacterium figures out how to use that package
8155934 when bacteria attack the lung there are two steps they need to do to establish pneumonia
8155935 they need to stick to lung cells and they also need to invade the lung cells our experiments were designed to separately test those two steps and we established that the pili are not used for adhesion but for invasion which was not understood before
8155936 so far only 20 percent or so of the clinically important strains of pneumococci have developed this trick of producing the proteins for making pili
8155937 in creating vaccines we want to use proteins that occur in a wide variety of bacterial strains these pili related proteins are not prime candidates so we can now concentrate on other proteins that we know are expressed almost universally by pneumococci and that we can put into a vaccine
8155938 current vaccines used in the developed world cost over 100 a dose and are limited to protecting against perhaps 10 to 15 types of pneumococci
8155939 but that price is far too high for developing countries and there are 90 types of pneumococci out there

8155941 that bradman made a century on average every time he batted is remarkable in itself but to realise his batting average is virtually twice as high as anyone who played test cricket for any length of time shows why he is one of sports great stories
8155942 of the 2 519 batsmen who have taken the crease in 131 years of test cricket bradman stands alone and untouched
8155943 i am no aware of any other sport which has one competitor so far above any other performer
8155944 sir donald bradman was indeed a great australian and he remains a great example of australian sporting excellence
8155945 he was the greatest sportsman in any sport and in any era as far as i would be concerned
8155946 it is impossible to imagine an australian national portrait gallery without a portrait of bradman
8155947 we found the abducted japanese man minutes ago he has been shot several times
8155948 we are aware of press reports but are still checking
8155949 and the minister has yet to make a determination on this proposal
8155950 so obviously some of the issues you raised may be amongst those the minister will have to consider in the context of that epbc consideration
8155951 it is the case that the government and this minister are committed to proper and transparent administration of the epbc act
8155952 the ministers decision is within the context of the statutory framework and he has to have regard to issues under the act accordingly
8155953 in the context of a statutory discretion there is no such thing as an automatic rejection and im sure the senator would be aware of that
8155954 i think well be able to strengthen legislation and apply bandaid solutions to give us breathing space but ultimately if you want to preserve koalas and everything we value such as less crowded beaches and roads then the population has to be stabilised
8155955 i am concerned that the state government is trying to manipulate the national strategy by being seen to be doing something about the dire state of koalas in queensland
8155956 ive read 700 post mortems of urban koalas and i can tell you a lot of these koalas are simply starving to death
8155957 at the halfway mark of the season we probably thought that we were going to play finals the way we were going
8155958 we had a bit of an easier run you could probably say after our first half and thats when we struggled a bit to finish those games off
8155959 id have to say wed be pretty disappointed with the way we finished off the year
8155960 we still knew we had a job to do and we had to win the games to do that but we certainly did drop off towards the end of the season
8155961 if we get away with a win this week well miss out on the finals but well go into next year with a bit of confidence
8155962 next time we play sydney well have a bit of confidence as well knowing we can knock them off
8155963 i dont think ill be up there i think theres a lot of boys ahead of me at this stage
8155964 i share in the joy felt by all malaysians on this historic day this is a victory for the people and its great to be back
8155965 we will restore the integrity of the judiciary fight corruption and build a truly unified nation
8155966 he does not have the minimal credibility needed to run the country day by day let alone to take it in the new directions we need to go in a complex world
8155967 this is a second time that the malaysian people have given a clear message with the first at the general elections it is a rejection of the present leader and he must leave now
8155968 we will all be there to welcome anwar as the leader of the opposition and the parliament will be very different with his voice
8155969 it is a real morale boost for the pakatan rakyat in parliament
8155970 it is time to face the music it is we who have been buried
8155971 its a decisive victory across races across economic classes for anwar ibrahim its a decisive message calling for change
8155972 that gives us some encouragement in regard to the prospects for our 2008 09 results but we will be very much dependent on average rainfall and average river flows going forward
8155973 we remain confident that low world stocks will help maintain the soft commodity prices above their long term average and that our marketing strategy will allow us to capture these high prices
8155974 a concert of this nature is not conducive to teach the younger generation to become good citizens upright and competitive but instead would weaken them morally and mentally
8155975 if the concert organisers do not heed this warning to cancel the concert pas youth will order all muslim youth to turn up and protest the concert in order to prevent it from taking place
8155976 how long do you have to masterplan before you actually do anything
8155977 aramac is again a symptom of the larger malaise that is impacting across queensland health
8155978 add all these issues together you still find that 10 years after being in government the health crisis continues to roll out unfortunately day in day out
8155979 im not much of a politician but i do know that the government of the day has a community service obligation to look after all queenslanders and that goes for the little places like aramac with 300 people
8155980 its hardly a hospital now when we havent had a full time doctor there for the last four years because we cant attract a full time doctor there
8155981 what we want to do is find a new model of care that will deliver health services for the people of aramac and stop this charade about pretending that they have a fully functioning hospital because they clearly dont
8155982 winter always is our busiest time but staff sickness hasnt helped on this occasion along with an increase in the number of elderly patients presenting to the hospital
8155983 people carry on calling it a third world health system that its in crisis thats nonsense
8155984 if it was in crisis we wouldnt be able to treat record numbers of patients wed be going backwards and that is not the case on every indices
8155985 these fast snapshots will let scientists monitor rapidly changing sources
8155986 this is 3c 454 3 in pegasus a type of active galaxy called a blazar its now undergoing a flaring episode that makes it especially bright
8155987 but when the going gets tough the tough get going
8155988 the extreme volatility of fuel prices exchange rates and pilot attrition makes it impossible to provide a reliable profit forecast for the year
8155989 if the fuel prices and exchange rate stays within current levels and if our pilot attrition rate does not go beyond 25 per cent per annum we believe that the group should be able to at least maintain its current level of profitability
8155990 to stop dipping i thought it worked great i mean literally right then right there you go for treatments three or four days straight and youre done
8155991 well ive seen that chart there and i damn sure havent had them where the chart suggests some of them go they definitely put them places where i havent had a necessity to dabble in
8155992 no its not painful at all best case scenario it feels like you had a massage kind of restful you had a massage and it solves your problem worst case scenario youve had a massage and it doesnt solve your problem
8155993 a lot of people want to quit the drugs the medication because medication has side effects
8155994 some people theyre scared of the needle everybodys different but we use real real tiny disposable needles if theyre scared we use something else not only the needle still natural
8155995 there was the asthma crew of which i was the poster child
8155996 i was on as much stuff as anybody and then mine asthma medication was none nones not a hundred percent true its down 90 percent from what it once was acupuncture worked tremendously but the people ive tried to explain it to tell it to that also have asthma to my knowledge nobodys really taken me up on it because they cant reconcile the needles
8155997 he wants me to try it though i might try it hes been trying to talk me into it
8155998 its good for so many different things like at dallas we used it for if a guy had a strain or something you could use the acupuncture go straight to that inflammation spot and it heals it a lot faster
8155999 hes always been wondering if it was a little more unhealthy than he needed to be getting hooked on coffee and drinking it so much
8156000 this finding represents a key extension of other studies on puma because such loss had never been shown before in human cancer
8156001 on the one hand patients receiving traditional chemotherapy can suffer the loss of immune cells and this loss occurs in part because puma induces the death of these cells
8156002 in this case the goal would be to protect patients bone marrow by developing drugs to inhibit puma on the other hand for patients with a lymphoma in which puma was inactivated drugs could be used to reactivate the gene to trigger apoptosis and kill the tumor cells
8156003 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
8156004 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
8156005 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
8156006 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
8156007 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
8156008 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation
8156009 this is a call to the global community that it is possible to increase pediatric cancer survival even in countries that have high under 5 mortality rates for other causes such as infectious diseases
8156010 with a modest financial investment we can improve survival very quickly
8156011 that is because these countries have developed twinning programs with st jude and other institutions
8156012 the data show a modest investment in health if it is well organized can produce an incredible increase in pediatric cancer survival
8156013 countries with limited resources should not be afraid to tackle pediatric cancer as a national health priority because they can have decent programs if they make a relatively small investment
8156014 and that investment can come from outside sources as well
8156015 target presents varietys power of youth campaign is a powerful one one that harnesses the energy of more than 150 young performers who are in a position to influence their peers and fans with the support of target and our other sponsors the power of youth effort has the opportunity to generate millions of dollars to benefit st jude childrens research hospital and create a bedrock of social awareness within the next generation of entertainment
8156016 our partnership educates and encourages young individuals to take action in their community
8156017 this event is important to target because of our long standing relationship with st jude childrens research hospital and the meaningful work they do
8156018 my father opened the doors of st jude through the generosity of the entertainment community
8156019 target and variety continue the tradition of entertainers giving back to people in need the dedication and enthusiasm of young hollywood and partners like variety and target enables us to carry on my fathers vision that no child should die in the dawn of life

8156022 i think its going to come down to what we feel like doing early in the game and how we want to go about business
8156023 all three of those guys are able to start it really doesnt matter who steps on the field first because all three of them are going to play and all three of them are going to make good plays
8156024 these findings emphasize that patients with aml especially those with high white blood cell count should be treated in an experienced tertiary center with a good supportive care team
8156025 for example at st jude we have a dedicated team of clinicians taking care of aml patients and they are more aware of the need to treat hyperleukocytosis are more experienced and are more vigilant in patient care than is usually found at a less specialized hospital
8156026 even though we had dramatically reduced early deaths in this group of patients in the latter period of the study the long term result for patients with these complications was still not good
8156027 we have continued to address their problems with new treatment approaches and have now improved not only the early results but also their long term outcome
8156028 some t cell receptors are adept at promoting autoimmunity some are poor and some are protective it is not clear why one t cell receptor can promote autoimmunity whereas another t cell receptor on a similar kind of t cell either doesnt do anything or even protects against autoimmune reaction
8156029 this finding of an association between t cell engraftment and spontaneous disease suggested to us that there is some barrier to the development of disease
8156030 why are cells that engraft better more likely to cause disease we really dont know the answer once the mice start to get disease they get very sick but there is sort of a triggering point our findings may suggest that disease triggering in these models involves a mass effect that requires some quantity of specific t cells to ignite disease but we really want to find out whether it is the cell number itself or whether receptor recognition properties that lead to increased engraftment also lead to increased susceptibility to disease these are things we can test
8156031 these findings dont have a direct clinical implication right now but if we understand which t cells induce pathology and why and which cells are protective or passive we will gain a better sense of where to target what are called antigen specific therapies
8156032 those therapies try to selectively target the t cells that cause disease sparing the rest of the immune system
8156033 a major issue we face in managing patients with recurrent sarcomas is the paucity of active agents
8156034 there is a limited number of drugs that are active against bone sarcomas and these are usually used as front line treatments when the sarcomas recur we have essentially no active agents
8156035 we were first very careful to see whether we would see any excess toxicity in children compared to that seen in adults
8156036 when we found that the combination was well tolerated we used it in more patients since our colleagues at rady childrens hospital were also using it for refractory sarcoma we decided to pool our data
8156037 further evaluation of this drug combination is warranted in these patients
8156038 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves
8156039 our findings hint that this delayed onset could be explained by subtle defects in the molecular controls on t cells
8156040 the itams we studied are little molecular tags inside the cell by which the t cell receptor communicates to the rest of the cell
8156041 the mystery we wanted to address was why the t cell receptor needs 10 itams to do its job why not just have a simple on off switch
8156042 we theorized that there were two possibilities why the immune system needs so many itams
8156043 one is that the requirement was purely quantitative and that the itams were there for signal amplification the second possibility is that different itams do slightly different things they do have slightly different structures so maybe they bind to some signaling molecules better than others and their positions in the t cell receptor are different so while our primary observation is that quantity is more important than itam type we also found that type has some influence
8156044 one implication of our findings is that a relatively small defect in the efficiency of signal transduction through the t cell receptor could give rise to a subtle failing in negative selection which gives rise over a long period of time to a few overly active t cells that might initiate autoimmunity
8156045 clearly from our studies there is the possibility that you dont really need a very big reduction in t cell receptor signal strength to have a defect in negative selection
8156046 we were surprised to find that many itams were required to make t cells divide and expand but only one or two was required to make t cells secrete cytokines
8156047 we believe this idea that t cell signaling acts more like a rheostat than an on off switch offers significant new insights into how t cell development and function is controlled
8156048 our findings show that children under 3 years with dpg can potentially respond better to treatment than older children
8156049 unlike other previous studies in young children where the diagnosis of dpg was based on either ct scans or magnetic resonance imaging mri the diagnosis of all our patients was based on mri only ct scans are not able to differentiate between dpg a tumor that occurs in the brainstem and other tumors which originate in the same area with a better prognosis
8156050 we believe that the more we learn about dpgs the more likely we will be able to design more effective treatments for children of all ages with this tumor
8156051 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy
8156052 the results also explain how the loss of neu1 can cause bone marrow transplantations to fail and therefore suggests that such failures might also be corrected by target therapeutics
8156053 our work represents an unexpected and important clue to one of the prominent clinical manifestations of sialidosis patients
8156054 we were surprised to discover that an old ubiquitous enzyme in lysosomes better known for digesting cellular waste products plays such an important role in a basic biological process that when exacerbated contributes to the outcome of such a terrible disease in children
8156055 the evidence strongly suggests that in children lacking a normal gene for neu1 disruption of the bone marrow environment causes the exodus of hematopoietic cells from the marrow to the spleen
8156056 that leads to development of the symptoms of sialidosis although we dont have a cure for this terrible disease we are now beginning to identify alternative ways to improve the disease outcome in affected children
8156057 the exciting thing about this work is that it sheds light on two major issues the cause of sialidosis and the reason for bone marrow transplantation failure in the absence of neu1
8156058 this wealth of new information gives us a better understanding of the physiological function of neu1 which appears to be much broader than originally thought this illustrates the important role of basic research in making discoveries that have major implications for medical problems
8156059 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy

8156067 it is always gratifying to see one of the nci designated cancer centers achieve comprehensive status recognition of excellence not only in state of the art care and cancer research but also in patient education community outreach and the dissemination of vital information to professionals and the public
8156068 these extra efforts to establish programs that reach out to surrounding communities and patients are the hallmarks of our comprehensive centers which now number 41 this enhanced designation is a timely recognition of important contributions and advances made by the dedicated staff of st jude
8156069 being designated a comprehensive cancer center is a prestigious accomplishment and to be the only pediatric center is an incomparable distinction for st jude
8156070 st jude is well known for having innovative programs led by the best and the brightest faculty and staff now being awarded comprehensive stature places an additional nci imprimatur on st jude and further validates our position among the countrys leading cancer centers this also speaks volumes about dr kastans strong leadership as our cancer center director
8156071 its rewarding to see a designation of comprehensive to an institution that is exclusively focused on children
8156072 they have a huge population of survivors that they alone have the resources and capability to bring back for follow up studies so they are to be congratulated and envied in that they are the only uniquely pediatric cancer center in the country
8156073 our international outreach program directed by dr raul ribeiro is a wonderful example of how a medical institution can provide important services to local national and worldwide communities
8156074 in addition to the effective web based efforts st jude has a long and successful track record of bringing modern medicine to less advantaged countries through education of local health care providers and establishment of pediatric cancer clinics
8156075 while maintaining significant activities in education and community service st jude will continue its major efforts in both basic laboratory research and clinical investigation to better understand the biology of cancer and develop novel treatment approaches
8156076 our findings show that children under 3 years with dpg can potentially respond better to treatment than older children
8156077 unlike other previous studies in young children where the diagnosis of dpg was based on either ct scans or magnetic resonance imaging mri the diagnosis of all our patients was based on mri only ct scans are not able to differentiate between dpg a tumor that occurs in the brainstem and other tumors which originate in the same area with a better prognosis
8156078 we believe that the more we learn about dpgs the more likely we will be able to design more effective treatments for children of all ages with this tumor
8156079 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves
8156080 our findings hint that this delayed onset could be explained by subtle defects in the molecular controls on t cells
8156081 the itams we studied are little molecular tags inside the cell by which the t cell receptor communicates to the rest of the cell
8156082 the mystery we wanted to address was why the t cell receptor needs 10 itams to do its job why not just have a simple on off switch
8156083 we theorized that there were two possibilities why the immune system needs so many itams
8156084 one is that the requirement was purely quantitative and that the itams were there for signal amplification the second possibility is that different itams do slightly different things they do have slightly different structures so maybe they bind to some signaling molecules better than others and their positions in the t cell receptor are different so while our primary observation is that quantity is more important than itam type we also found that type has some influence
8156085 one implication of our findings is that a relatively small defect in the efficiency of signal transduction through the t cell receptor could give rise to a subtle failing in negative selection which gives rise over a long period of time to a few overly active t cells that might initiate autoimmunity
8156086 clearly from our studies there is the possibility that you dont really need a very big reduction in t cell receptor signal strength to have a defect in negative selection
8156087 we were surprised to find that many itams were required to make t cells divide and expand but only one or two was required to make t cells secrete cytokines
8156088 we believe this idea that t cell signaling acts more like a rheostat than an on off switch offers significant new insights into how t cell development and function is controlled
8156089 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
8156090 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides
8156091 the study indicates that when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy this surgical approach provides an opportunity to preserve renal function while maintaining a high probability of cure
8156092 commonly when a child has bilateral disease the surgeon will remove the kidney that has the most tumor and do a partial nephrectomy on the other side
8156093 but if a patient then develops problems in the remaining kidney the options are limited because one kidney has been taken out of the equation at st jude we try to save as much kidney as possible in children with bilateral disease thus far 100 percent of the time we have been able to save normal kidney on both sides
8156094 the hunger strike period was generally a time when nationalist commitment to the struggle was heightened and refreshed but since then there have been concerted enemy efforts to confuse and demoralise
8156095 i think you have to deal with two separate circumstances it had little effect internally because people who are actively involved understand the situation and what the enemy is trying to achieve the use of
8156096 when the governor comes into your cell youre supposed to stand up but we just sat down anywhere on the bed on the chair the same in the exercise yard the screws would get flustered the other prisoners would stare at us
8156097 it is a waste of time shouting up the ira the important thing is to join

8156101 just hear those sleigh bells jingle ing ring ting tingle ing too cmon its lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
8156102 this motility is also called dancing because when you electrically stimulate an outer hair cell with a sound the cell body spontaneously elongates and contracts along with the sound
8156103 it is very dramatic to see these hair cells dance with the sound
8156104 we found that these mice showed exactly the same kinds of hearing deficiency as the previous knockout mice
8156105 therefore we believe that these experiments eliminate criticism of our earlier experiments with the knockout mice
8156106 with this study we still cannot really exclude stereociliary motility from contributing to cochlear amplification because eliminating somatic motility also reduces ciliary motility so it is not possible to totally isolate either form of motility in fact we hypothesize that the two mechanisms might work together in different aspects of amplification
8156107 for example an overdose of aspirin causes a high frequency hearing loss by inhibiting prestins function
8156108 also there is evidence that many cases of high frequency hearing loss are caused by defects in the cells molecular machinery that involves prestin and two mutations that have been detected in the prestin gene in humans are reported to be associated with deafness
8156109 one of the main reasons my family and i support st jude is because there is always something you can do for someone else
8156110 it costs more than 1 2 million a day to run st jude so every penny counts whats really cool about st jude is that it doesnt matter about things like race religion or a familys inability to pay they are really here to help the kids and that is what is really important it is great to be able to encourage kids to learn and help other kids at the same time
8156111 if you go out to eat for lunch or dinner on september 24 by going to chilis you will help seriously ill children become the ultimate survivors on that day chilis restaurants nationwide will be donating all their profits to support st jude
8156112 jim nantz has received many awards and honors in his outstanding career with cbs sports
8156113 to have the honor to present him an award that bears my name will indeed be a very special moment for me
8156114 we can all make a difference in the lives of others im proud to help st jude i feel like im just a regular person helping out
8156115 showcase is a fun filled weekend of events for the whole family to enjoy it features mans best friend working to provide funds for the best friend of children in need st jude
8156116 this is truly a win win event because the thousands of out of town exhibitors also have a major impact on the memphis economy
8156117 all the things that i wish i had told him all the thanks the news i could still tell him the conversation goes on
8156118 surely you must have some sort of defense mechanism that enables you to look away from all that sadness or numb yourself to the horror of a dying child
8156119 we speak frequently and proudly about the medical marvels that take place within the walls of st jude
8156120 but we all know none of this could be accomplished without the love dedication and financial support of each and every volunteer partner corporate sponsor and donor it is because of you that the most gifted doctors and scientists in the world come here to do their finest work
8156121 but because they are priceless god has blessed us with an army of truly dedicated individuals who are committed to the dream of danny thomas and the mission of st jude
8156122 i know if my father were here he would want randy to have this award
8156123 i didnt have the chance to know him as well as some of you but it shows you how a good man can inspire you in just a brief time
8156124 i have to be honest i didnt know much about st jude childrens research hospital before the create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign in 2006
8156125 that was my first introduction to the hospital and i was real excited about the fundraiser i got involved right away in doing whatever i could to make it a success but i have to say that this year is so much more personal for me
8156126 there was a pearl like reflective glow to her eye
8156127 we looked at them wondering if this was going to be katie soon
8156128 a lot of times in children as young as katie the treatment breaks down the bones in the face
8156129 they were tactful and truthful that meant a lot we made the decision based on quality of life concerns we felt it was best for her but that didnt make it easy
8156130 even people we just briefly met they all let us know that they were there for whatever we needed
8156131 we got messages and e mails from chilis employees all over the country sending us their thoughts and prayers
8156132 thats huge thats huge when youre going through this theyve given us all the time off weve needed to take care of our family were very grateful to have that
8156133 it was a shock to see her hooked up to the iv lines and oxygen
8156134 well forget that she lost an eye we honestly forget
8156135 we joke that every time she comes home from the hospital she has a new toy
8156136 once she gets outside she loves nothing better than just running through the grass
8156137 if we find a resource to help us and we think it might help another store we share it
8156138 i think this approach will be just as effective if not more
8156139 through their dedication nearly 75 000 chilis grill amp bar team members made the 2007 create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign a resounding success
8156140 this years campaign once again exceeded our highest expectations totaling more than 8 2 million for the patients of st jude bringing us closer to our goal of raising 50 million and making the chilis care center building we are dedicating today a reality
8156141 as we stand at the foot of the chilis care center in celebration today i want to thank chilis grill amp bar and our other partners who helped make this dream possible we are truly overwhelmed by your dedication to help st jude provide unsurpassed patient care and unparalleled scientific research and you can know that you have helped bring hope to thousands of children from around the world
8156142 the chilis care center is a significant part of our long term strategy to translate basic research at st jude into the most advanced and effective care of patients
8156143 integrating patient care and research holds the key to more rapid advances in science and medicine this new facility will help us maintain our leadership role in defining the forefront of research to advance the treatment of children with cancer and other catastrophic pediatric diseases
8156144 a series of complex developmental processes must be carefully orchestrated for the eye to form correctly
8156145 one important aspect of this coordination is that retinal thickness be the same irrespective of eye size for example the mouse eye is about 5 000 times smaller than that of the elephant eye but the retinal thickness in these two species is comparable
8156146 this represents the first example of a role for a myc gene in retinal development
8156147 on the basis of our data we propose that n myc plays a central role in coordinating retinal proliferation with eye growth during development
8156148 the determination of n myc target genes during retinal development may also contribute to the current understanding of retinoblastoma progression
8156149 importantly for retinas to maintain nearly constant thickness across species that have different sizes of eyes the total number of retinal cells must change several fold
8156150 the identification of n myc as a key regulator of these processes allows us to begin to understand the coordination of complex developmental programs in the developing eye and how these processes have evolved
8156151 on behalf of the entire global stanford financial group of companies let me say how honored we are to present this check to st jude childrens research hospital
8156152 this tournament is the flagship event for stanfords global relationship with st jude and we look forward to continuing to work together to raise funds and awareness for the battle against childhood cancer we were very pleased with the success of this years tournament our first as title sponsor and to be able to present the largest donation in the history of this event is a true honor for me st jude and these incredible kids is the reason we are involved and im delighted that we can do our part to help st jude work its miracles
8156153 with our donation today and as we have for the last 22 years fedex has supported the incredibly important work being done at st jude childrens research hospital
8156154 we remain strongly committed to this great organization through our continued involvement with the stanford st jude championship and we look forward to carrying on our charitable giving on a national level through the many opportunities with our sponsorship of the fedexcup
8156155 obviously i have my own motivation to make as many eagles as possible but with the eagles for st jude program theres an even greater reward when i do so eagles for st jude allows me to share that good feeling that i have on the golf course and turn it into something truly lasting and meaningful off the golf course i feel like my accomplishments help st jude accomplish its mission to find cures for these special children
8156156 we are grateful to stanford financial group and fedex for their commitment to make this event even more successful than in years past to see a professional like vijay singh get behind our event and support it with both his time and his money is very gratifying we see the stanford st jude championship only growing and we know thats because of the sincere and long term commitment by these incredible partners
8156157 all of the materials are provided for you and are ready to use so all we had to do was make it happen
8156158 with st jude we play our music our format isnt disrupted
8156159 even if a radio station isnt ready to put on their own radiothons
8156160 they should definitely visit another stations event to see what goes on
8156161 the people that tune you in keep us moving forward
8156162 give thanks for the healthy kids in your life and give to those who are not
8156163 i am so proud that these buildings are joining the thanks and giving campaign to support st jude
8156164 making eagles on the tour takes on a whole new meaning with the eagles for st jude program because i know my accomplishments help st jude achieve its mission to find cures for these special children
8156165 it touches my heart to see these brave kids they have so much courage to fight it makes me feel proud every time i make an eagle and it gives me added drive and passion to play my best golf
8156166 st jude is vital in the battle against catastrophic childhood diseases and we want the world to know it it is our hope that the eagles for st jude program will increase awareness for this special place and encourage golf fans and those who support st jude to donate to this worthy cause
8156167 eagles for st jude is a wonderfully unique program that shows stanfords amazing commitment to the kids of st jude it will be thrilling to watch the eagles accumulating throughout the pga tour knowing that each one will help support st judes ground breaking research and life saving care
8156168 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8156169 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8156170 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8156171 i could have voted from my home she is our captain and we dont want to see her disrespected
8156172 who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
8156173 on va repartir dans une nouvelle s rie partir du mois de d cembre et il y aura au moins trois prime times avec des c l brit s il nest absolument pas question que france 2 abandonne noubliez pas les paroles tout est pr vu il peut aussi bien y avoir des rafales en quotidienne 19 heures et revenir aussi rapidement dune mani re hebdomadaire

8156176 were going to have a banner hanging in our student union that says we are the 2006 2007 national champions
8156177 but the only thing harder than being no 1 is staying no 1
8156178 i have no idea if we are going to reach it but we will give it our best shot
8156179 for the first three years i helped peripherally i got prizes for their events
8156180 i saw it as a program that had a lot of potential
8156181 i thought it was something we could really turn into something big
8156182 weve had some great support and some great students and it has worked out for us these past few years
8156183 what i had been told about the hospital didnt compare to what it is actually like there
8156184 talking with students from other colleges and hearing about the programs that work for them was very educational
8156185 it gives us new ideas on what we can do at our campus
8156186 if we start making it a competition we lose sight of what st jude is about
8156187 we have 16 000 people on our campus and 10 percent of them participate in the event id like to believe we can get more than that if we do our job right in promoting the hospital the money will come
8156188 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
8156189 when the ring goes missing i will be using your fees to pay back to the sponsor
8156190 your fees is more than the cost of the ring you can play with it because you can afford it i could not afford
8156191 you can afford it dont lie this ring is for female does not suit me
8156192 its time to hand the torch to the next generation of young people to continue this important role of st jude in the international community
8156193 dr websters legacy is that he has highlighted the importance of the avian reservoir of influenza as it relates to human health
8156194 we now know that the avian reservoir is the initial source for all human flu he has helped the world understand that we need to keep an eye on whats going on in the animal populations and communicate with each other about those changes
8156195 richard has attended who meetings and has been accepted by the international community
8156196 because the control of cancer in the bone marrow has improved so much cns relapse has become proportionally more important
8156197 if we are to further increase the cure rate and improve the quality of life of our patients we need to concentrate on preventing cns relapse
8156198 most clinicians still feel strongly that high risk patients need radiation treatment because they think that without radiation such patients have a very high risk of relapse
8156199 but i disagree i think that we should avoid using radiation in all patients even those at high risk of relapse with optimal chemotherapy we can reduce the relapse rate to a very low level we should reserve radiation for the treatment of relapse whats more the salvage rate for cns relapse in patients who did not receive prior radiation is very high and if patients who are treated with radiation develop bone marrow or cns relapse later on it is more difficult to treat them successfully
8156200 optimization of intrathecal therapy to allow adequate distribution of intrathecal therapy in the cns and to avoid traumatic lumbar puncture which leads to an increase in cns relapse are essential for the success of cns directed treatment
8156201 however there are no conclusive trials that show this approach to be superior to intensive chemotherapy
8156202 so whether transplantation has any role in the treatment of isolated cns relapse is uncertain
8156203 cns relapse may just be the tip of the iceberg meaning that while we may see cns relapse there may be hidden leukemia in the bone marrow
8156204 at st jude our treatment protocols involve detecting subclinical cns leukemia early and treating it aggressively
8156205 such treatment has allowed both good cns and bone marrow control therefore we have achieved excellent outcomes for our patients
8156206 in addition to fulfilling your new years fitness resolutions and raising needed funds for the children of st jude this is also your opportunity to be a part of history by creating a new guinness world record for the most abdominal crunches done in one hour by a group
8156207 im extremely proud to lead this national campaign to benefit a very worthy cause while educating women on the importance of strengthening their core as a first step to greater fitness
8156208 st jude is an incredible research center where doctors and researchers are committed to saving the lives of children with cancer and other deadly diseases
8156209 our family is forever grateful for the courageous people at st jude and all that they do ab crunch challenge participants will be a part of a vital team supporting the hospitals life saving work and ensuring that no child is ever turned away because of a familys inability to pay
8156210 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
8156211 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides
8156212 the study indicates that when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy this surgical approach provides an opportunity to preserve renal function while maintaining a high probability of cure
8156213 commonly when a child has bilateral disease the surgeon will remove the kidney that has the most tumor and do a partial nephrectomy on the other side
8156214 but if a patient then develops problems in the remaining kidney the options are limited because one kidney has been taken out of the equation at st jude we try to save as much kidney as possible in children with bilateral disease thus far 100 percent of the time we have been able to save normal kidney on both sides
8156215 our report reflects how adept st jude has become at designing and conducting even complex clinical trials for twinning through iop
8156216 this is a powerful strategy for sharing our knowledge and skills with countries that have excellent clinicians but limited resources
8156217 through twinning we can ensure delivery of state of the art therapy to children in other countries while identifying additional research opportunities
8156218 it was definitely an honor to win the stanford st jude championship last year not only because of the talented field i competed against but because of the special place this tournament holds in this communitys heart and the wonderful charity it benefits
8156219 i look forward to returning to memphis in two months to defend my title
8156220 celebrating our 51st year in memphis the stanford st jude championship has a very rich history
8156221 it is the strong support of the community as well as the commitment from dedicated sponsors such as stanford financial group and fedex that make it one of the longest running tournaments on the pga tour were excited with the way this years field is shaping up and were looking forward to entertaining our fans with another first class tournament
8156222 this is probably the first description of what is happening mechanistically that contributes to the ability of cells to delay apoptosis
8156223 it provides incredible insights into how three proteins work and how they can control apoptosis
8156224 this suggests that the protein is playing basically the same role in humans as we described in mice
8156225 that was intriguing because several studies suggested that hax1 was controlled by cytokine signaling
8156226 also studies have suggested that if you overexpressed hax1 in cells the cells were protected from undergoing apoptosis
8156227 that additional window of survival is extremely important because in the body cytokines are limiting
8156228 the key observation was that hax1 was important in helping cells to survive importantly what happened to the mice we generated was remarkably similar to what happens if you remove the mitochondrial enzymes called htra2 or parl
8156229 these findings provide new avenues to pursue to gain a better understanding of these disease processes and ultimately to develop better therapies
8156230 it really takes a series of genetic lesions to lead to cancer
8156231 you may get activation of an oncogene but you may also need activation of a tumor suppressor gene and an alteration in a cell death pathway
8156232 it appears from our study and other work published previously that all you need to get cml is that chromosomal translocation and bcr abl1 expression
8156233 the vast majority of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemias are of b cell lineage
8156234 the loss of the ikaros gene is a nearly obligatory lesion for the development of bcr abl1 all
8156235 and clearly must be a genetic lesion that is cooperating with bcr abl1
8156236 that is an important finding that may give insight into how that transformation occurs or it may give insight into a better way to treat the disease if one can figure out how the ikaros deletion is working
8156237 we think we have identified a pathway that can be used to prevent tumor formation and a potential target for therapy
8156238 we were interested in whether there were signals that inhibited tumor formation
8156239 and if there were which ones were they could they be used to identify new therapeutic targets
8156240 what was not known and what we now find is that the effect of bmps on normal gnp cells is almost exactly mimicked in gnp like tumor cells
8156241 what we found is that using a lower dose of the sonic hedgehog inhibitor in combination with bmp gives the same therapeutic effect as high doses of the hedgehog inhibitor
8156242 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy
8156243 gene expression profiling will help us identify targets for future therapy
8156244 it is still crude but in the end you identify multiple genes for further study if you find a good target for therapy the next step is to develop molecular therapeutics for the target
8156245 pharmacogenetics is important to finding out a persons response and tolerance for a therapy
8156246 certain drugs may be good for 99 percent of patients but bad for 1 percent we need to find out who those patients are who are at risk so we can spare them from toxicity
8156247 we need to know the leukemic cell genetics that affect drug sensitivity or resistance and what role pharmacogenetics plays in treatment to improve efficacy and decrease toxicity
8156248 that way we dont over treat low risk patients or under treat high risk patients
8156249 effector t cells mediate immune responses like accelerators make cars go forward while a specialized population called regulatory t cells stop an immune response like brakes slow down a car
8156250 regulatory t cells actively suppress the activation of effector t cells that are reactive and damaging to self tissues thereby preventing autoimmune disease
8156251 in the context of an infection after the effector t cell has orchestrated the correct immune response and the pathogen is gone regulatory t cells can help calm down the immune system
8156252 in contrast there are very few that issue stop signals only two or three so il 35 is special
8156253 this discovery adds significantly to our understanding of how these cells prevent immune responses from running out of control and causing damage
8156254 to return to the car analogy il 35 may turn out to be a very important brake for the immune system
8156255 there is mounting evidence that regulatory t cells stop our ability to eradicate tumors
8156256 tumors produce a dilemma within the immune system on one hand the system wants to get rid of the tumor cells but on the other hand theyre a part of us thus regulatory t cells may prevent the immune system from attacking the tumor experimental studies have shown that if you can remove regulatory t cells or dampen their activity then tumor immunity becomes vigorous and the body can get rid of the tumor
8156257 regulatory t cells are seen as a major impediment to the development of effective anti cancer vaccines and may prevent sterilizing immunity in certain chronic infections such as hepatitis c and tuberculosis
8156258 blocking the activity of il 35 may reduce the function of regulatory t cells and their ability to block anti tumor immune responses so treatments that block il 35 activity may make anti cancer vaccines more effective
8156259 when i interviewed with dario he said the best thing about st jude is that your only limitation is your imagination and he was right
8156260 one of the best things about science is the fact that your discovery attracts the interest of other bright minds other scientists will hear about il 35 and say maybe this new protein is important in the disease process or condition that im studying by collaborating with others whose expertise is different than ours we can hasten progress
8156261 i believe this protein has a good chance of having therapeutic applications
8156262 im a st jude donor myself and like other donors i think its important to remember that at the end of the day the goal of our research is to treat patients especially the children we have here at st jude
8156263 decreased levels of transforming growth factor beta and increased levels of jnk are known to be associated with the transformation of myeloid cells into leukemic cells in humans
8156264 so those findings in our lab suggest once again that n myc is linked to aml
8156265 by eliminating il 3 from the culture we were able to unmask the apoptotic effect of n myc which greatly increased cell death
8156266 it was definitely an honor to win the stanford st jude championship last year not only because of the talented field i competed against but because of the special place this tournament holds in this communitys heart and the wonderful charity it benefits
8156267 i look forward to returning to memphis in two months to defend my title
8156268 celebrating our 51st year in memphis the stanford st jude championship has a very rich history
8156269 it is the strong support of the community as well as the commitment from dedicated sponsors such as stanford financial group and fedex that make it one of the longest running tournaments on the pga tour were excited with the way this years field is shaping up and were looking forward to entertaining our fans with another first class tournament
8156270 we think we have identified a pathway that can be used to prevent tumor formation and a potential target for therapy

8156275 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy
8156276 autophagy is a cell survival jack of all trades and were trying to understand the signals that trigger its onset
8156277 this process developed so early in the evolution of life that at least some types of microorganisms must have learned how to avoid this defensive response of the cell to being invaded we want to know how invading microorganisms avoid being destroyed by autophagy and learn how cancer cells use autophagy to resist chemotherapy drugs before they have a chance to work
8156278 we suspected that because tlr signaling triggers both phagocytosis and autophagy that this signal might also link these activities together as well as enable each process to occur separately
8156279 this would make sense since autophagy kills microorganisms that invade the cell and phagocytosis deliberately brings microorganisms into the cell to destroy them so having two totally separate and unrelated sets of signals to do a similar job would be like re inventing the biochemical wheel
8156280 this strongly suggested that tlr recruits parts of the autophagy machinery to enable the phagosome to fully develop and fuse with the lysosome even if autophagy itself doesnt occur simultaneously
8156281 we can actually see phagocytosis take place in live cells and we can study it in detail so we know the steps involved
8156282 but autophagy seems to occur suddenly and we know about it only after its very obviously underway now that we discovered that phagocytosis uses some of the same biochemical signals as autophagy does we can use that information to solve the mystery of how autophagy works we hope that we will be able to translate that new knowledge in the future into improved treatments for infections and cancer
8156283 this is probably the first description of what is happening mechanistically that contributes to the ability of cells to delay apoptosis
8156284 it provides incredible insights into how three proteins work and how they can control apoptosis
8156285 this suggests that the protein is playing basically the same role in humans as we described in mice
8156286 that was intriguing because several studies suggested that hax1 was controlled by cytokine signaling
8156287 also studies have suggested that if you overexpressed hax1 in cells the cells were protected from undergoing apoptosis
8156288 that additional window of survival is extremely important because in the body cytokines are limiting
8156289 the key observation was that hax1 was important in helping cells to survive importantly what happened to the mice we generated was remarkably similar to what happens if you remove the mitochondrial enzymes called htra2 or parl

8156327 i come to you on this night not just as micah goings but as the front line supporter of a man that is destined to do great things for his immediate and global community i come to you as a prime investor of a new aged system that in fact is not so new at all i come to you in hopes that your hearts be welcoming your minds open your eyes focused and your ears willing to not only hear but truly listen to the astounding recognition and support of a concrete idea that will change the mindset of a culture and a nation pushing us further to be truly undivided with liberty and justice for all
8156328 when i think back to my childhood and the things within my culture that i now perceive as generational curses i am automatically taken back to days of grade school where at any point in time on a random there would be groups of children myself included speaking about their family lives
8156329 when i met my husband i was not only impressed with his relationship with god but i was extremely inspired by his understanding of his role in the black community and his willingness to fully and wholeheartedly take on that role see he like i had come from different areas in this country but we shared the same examples of a broken home divided by the traps within our sub culture i love this man and i support him 100 for many reasons but one of the most profound reasons is that he shares the same tenacious spirit to strive for greatness that i do he can see into the future and see the hope for that future by looking into the past and accepting his responsibility as a man yet add a new twist on the conventional thinking by incorporating his woman appreciating her worth and value see i support him in the way that i do the same as the working mother who seamlessly transitions her roles as friend wife mother nurse etc supports him knowing that without his example the generations to come are lost and geared toward a road far more rough than they need to travel i support him in the way that the head of the household father who knows what it is to be the provider and protector of his family unit does and with the same tenacity because like these people i too understand the importance of the black community be not swayed i do understand that there are certain instances where some mothers and some fathers within our community will be a section of the single parent home however i do believe without a shadow of a doubt that non of them will agree that it is easier for the well rounded upbringing of a child in our community however in our support of the idea of bringing the black family back together again as a unit we realize with more examples of the strong african american undivided family there will be more for our children to look forward to there will be a greater sense of establishment less promiscuity in our teen children for the lack of ones sex groups attention from either parent has been proven to run a higher risk of dependency in on the opposite sex this brings the high percentage of sexually transmitted disease rates down to almost single digits and the alarming teen pregnancy rate down at least 40 this would also bring the high and rising rate of high school drop outs within our community to a halt for where there are two parents in a household its more effective on a childs education and educational experience we support the idea of the black community because we believe our children are the most valuable assets that we have we believe that we must invest in their future we must teach them to strive towards excellence and do so in all that they do we believe in the clich but oh so true statement that our children are our future for if not instilled in us as children to dig deeper push harder and do better where would we be so in closing i would like to leave you with a little food for thought regarding our vision as the forefront example of the beautiful black community as a testament to the fact that this new aged way of thinking as earlier stated is not so new at all and more than anything a promise that the immediate potential and future benefits far outweigh those of the way we as a community have been trying to go about our well being for i have chosen him that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the lord by doing righteousness and justice so that the lord may bring to abraham what he has promised him genesis 18 19 know that we have come from the blood of kings and queens from the blood of slaves and even slave masters think about it we have singlehandedly built this beautiful nation being an example of greatness conquering everything that we put our minds to we have come way to far to let something as minuscule and underlying as an attack on the foundation the black family to our existence blindly pull us down to what those who wish us nothing but the worst will have us become brothers sisters and elders please join me in the support of mr g who not only views this world through the eyes of beauty and greatness but applies his vision for the rest of the world to see my people i thank you god bless you and god bless the black community

8156441 we will do whatever we can to save these children
8156442 erano le 19 20 e mi trovato in coda ad un atr 72 della air dolomiti diretto a bologna tornavo da un lungo viaggio di lavoro a seul il velivolo con sessanta persone a bordo aveva gi rullato ma movimenti di altri aerei ci aveva fatto tornare indietro era tutto pronto per il decollo quando si sentito forte odore di bruciato
8156443 beh eravamo fermi al suolo sono quindici anni che volo nel mondo ed ho capito che non cerano rischi grosso qualche altro passeggero meno esperto di aerei andato invece nel pallone
8156444 un uomo quando ha visto che le hostess non aprivano le porte per farci uscire ha minacciato la dipendente le ha detto che avrebbe sbattuto allesterno lei ed il portellone se non avesse avuto la possibilit di uscire subito poi si calmato
8156445 i passeggeri sono usciti da due parti io ero in coda ed ho usato la scaletta attaccata alla porta situata in fondo allaereo chi uscito dalla porta anteriore invece non aveva la scaletta e neppure era stato attivato lo scivolo di emergenza chi sceso da l ha fatto un salto di quasi due metri donne con i tacchi si sono slogate le caviglie un uomo ha riportato una lesione ad un polso
8156446 per un surriscaldamento si era incendiato uno dei pneumatici del carrello il fumo denso aveva fatto pensare al peggio ma non cerano situazioni di grave emergenza sarebbe bastato un estintore usato subito per evitare allarmi
8156447 dopo nemmeno due minuti sul posto cerano ambulanze e vigili del fuoco c stato anche un momento quasi comico mentre i passeggeri scendevano illesi ed in ordine qualcuno stato investito dalla sostanza antincendio usata dai vigili del fuoco per domare le fiamme al carrello dellaereo ma qualche macchia al vestito non avr certo fatto male a nessuno
8156448 sono stati tutti molto gentili e professionali gi alle 22 30 cera un altro aereo per bologna si poteva pure pernottare in albergo potendo ripartire il giorno dopo con un nuovo volo o in treno sempre a spese della compagnia aerea di propriet della lufthansa
8156449 corsi intensivi per i prof del sud abbassano la qualit della scuola
8156450 mai detto che gli insegnanti del sud abbassano la qualit
8156451 un prezzo politico per pane e pasta lo stato crei un listino di riferimento
8156452 i think its best described in the way brooklyn smiles every day how shes a beautiful vibrant outspoken 3 year old and the way shes so full of life
8156453 die beiden haben sich freundschaftlich getrennt und ihre verlobung gel st
8156454 wir haben uns noch nicht entschieden wo wir heiraten werden aber wenn wir es wissen wird es sehr schnell gehen
8156455 son go inside and up the stairs and tell mr thomas that we are ready
8156456 i was told to tell mr thomas they are ready for him
8156457 they are joining in a personal way in the lifetime dream of my husband danny thomas in doing so members are ensuring the hospitals growth and effectiveness its preeminence in the world of medicine and its stature as a symbol of hope for children in the world
8156458 in 1962 of all of you standing only this group seated would have survived acute lymphoblastic leukemia
8156459 our goal is not to get bigger but to get better
8156460 it was everything we could do to save the lives of the children stricken with cancer
8156461 i expected to see a regular hospital i was not expecting to see a wonder world we feel very humble to be a part of this
8156462 donating our estate to st jude was the best decision my husband and i have made
8156463 we are relieved to see our estate going to such a great cause
8156464 there is always something new it is a living organism and the need to be a part of it is contagious
8156465 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8156466 the top 50 ranking shows melbourne is a world class operation ahead of sydney ranked 70 and brisbane ranked 100
8156467 excluding sydney the port of melbourne handles the same amount of containers as the combined total of all the other ports in australia including brisbane fremantle and adelaide
8156468 overall the port handles around 36 of the nations container trade which amounts to around 6 500 containers on average each day
8156469 me gust lo que hicieron en algunos truquitos se te vio insegura me gust
8156470 la coreograf a tuvo mucho estilo muy buena las vueltas de vals y ah el salto
8156471 when i was a boy growing up in kansas a friend of mine and i went fishing and as we sat there on the warmth of a summer afternoon we talked about what we wanted to do when we grew up i told him i wanted to be a major league baseball player a genuine professional like honus wagner my friend said that hed like to be president of the united states neither of us got our wish
8156472 if you want creative workers give them enough time to play
8156473 i was struck by one story the book about a man who went to his fireplace and told it
8156474 la realidad es m s incre ble que la ficci n
8156475 barack obama es mi candidato y debe ser nuestro presidente
8156476 se al la ex primera dama ante un oc ano de carteles blancos de
8156477 dijo clinton y el hall hizo una erupci n de aplausos y v tores
8156478 no necesitamos cuatro a os m s de los ltimos ocho a os
8156479 agreg en referencia a las dos presidencias del actual mandatario republicano george bush
8156480 si l es la respuesta entonces la pregunta debe ser rid cula
8156481 dijo el gobernador de nueva york david paterson sobre el candidato presidencial republicano
8156482 oh were not selling the company we just think its time we reinvigorated the mgm brand with someone else as its figurehead it been a longtime coming but spanky the lion needs to be put out to pasture steve irwin attempted to replace spanky with a croc in his film crocodile hunter collision course
8156483 not since his failed sex tape fiasco has the teen heart throb scraped so low
8156484 diese alberne ausgrenzungspolitik diese fortsetzung des kalten krieges mit l cherlichen mitteln bald beendet ist
8156485 einen solchen unsinn erz hlen den die nicht einmal selber glauben k nnen
8156486 das sollte die csu bedenken wenn sie jetzt ihre kreuzritterr stungen gegen die linke anlegt vielleicht kommen sie dann um die abtr nnigen cdu leute hinzurichten die sich mit uns eingelassen haben
8156487 dass diese alberne ausgrenzungspolitik diese fortsetzung des kalten krieges mit l cherlichen mitteln bald beendet ist
8156488 unsere ausgrenzung funktioniert teilweise ja nur noch weil die spd parteif hrung sich von der cdu durchs land treiben l sst
8156489 die spd spitze hat angst vor der cdu aber ich wei nicht wie lange die spd dazu braucht bis sie es sich wieder zutraut selbstst ndig zu denken und zu entscheiden
8156490 editor writer mary ellen korman has long been interested in spiritual transformation and its many approaches she teaches a yoga of body impressions and lives in southern pennsylvania
8156491 living with dogs tales of love commitment and enduring friendship
8156492 ethel and will had heard that madame blavatsky had only to point her finger at an object and it would fall the children watched her closely when finally she pointed and nothing happened they were disgusted with her
8156493 i did not try to stop the worry but just to separate it from the body
8156494 i did not go to him for spiritual teaching but solely for physical healing purposes
8156495 i have hopes that i shall find some interest in life
8156496 i visited the ashram each summer to sit in bhagawans presence
8156497 if i understood anything of the maharshis way of self inquiry it is entirely due to gurdjieff
8156498 she was an englishwoman always ready to do anyone a kindness no matter when or who it might be this she always did with great sensitivity
8156499 either the object is still there or the object was never there to begin with

8156502 durante un pranzo o una cena il momento della scelta del vino sicuramente quello in cui si concentra lattenzione dei commensali lo charme del sommelier pu rendere unico questo evento
8156503 im really pissed off and ill be contacting the dmca and a lawyer to proceed with legal action
8156504 your photos are nice but really whos going to steal any of our stuff were just a few people who like writing about the food we love and some of our experiences
8156505 when the numbers were high i would get stopped in the street maybe once a week
8156506 now that the viewing figures are lower on the tv everywhere i go someone will come up to me and say what a huge fan they are that just tells me that people watch the show in a more modern way and that it has reached its sort of critical mass
8156507 tivo had just sort of taken off this was four or five seasons ago and because we were on friday nights most people most fans dont watch it on first run they tivo it and watch it a zillion times
8156508 in fact i dont think we ever go into space
8156509 its really about big business the machinations and the subterfuge that go on inside of it when you have something that is groundbreaking and could change the nature of life and the future
8156510 its about a vibrant society its really at the height of its power and the height of its decadence at the same time
8156511 so its really a thriving vibrant culture thats going to come apart as we watch but its sort of the roller coaster its thrilling at the top when you see how far down youve got to go
8156512 each year the samaritan award is given to a broadcaster or organization that exemplifies the industrys commitment to serving the public interest through the airwaves
8156513 country cares is a program that truly embodies the spirit of this award as apparent through their tireless fundraising efforts and dedication to serving the patients of st jude childrens research hospital
8156514 there are a lot of heroes out there in radio who continue to make this happen
8156515 im just so happy and surprised by all the people especially in country music whove taken st jude to heart
8156516 he put on a mask too when we had our picture taken together
8156517 im just excited to be here doing what i can to help
8156518 the artists who come here need to take what theyve learned and pass it on the type of care offered here is revolutionary
8156519 all these people took the time out of their busy schedules to come here and help the kids
8156520 i dont want people to ever forget about st jude
8156521 long lived cells like those in the brain arent constantly being replaced like red blood cells are
8156522 these cells must have a way to remain healthy for a long time getting rid of mitochondria that threaten the cell by making ros is one of those strategies
8156523 the fact that reticulocytes must eject their mitochondria in order to form red blood cells makes it the perfect model for studying programmed mitochondrial clearance
8156524 the identification of nix as a protein that regulates programmed mitochondrial clearance is a significant advance because of the importance of this process in the health of long lived cells like those in the heart and brain
8156525 at univision and at each of the local stations in the univision radio network we are proud of the role we play for hispanics in the united states
8156526 our work with st jude is another example of our commitment to our communities the amazing response of our staff and listeners since we started our partnership 10 years ago demonstrates the importance of the st jude message of hope
8156527 we are very fortunate to have the support from univision radio and the hispanic community to ensure that no child is ever turned away from receiving treatment because of a familys inability to pay
8156528 we want the community to know that every donation even as little as 20 a month makes a difference in saving a childs life at st jude
8156529 part of my job is to motivate people when i see this for myself i want to make sure we have a very successful radiothon
8156530 eighty five percent of every dollar received comes to the hospital thats a very high number for any charity
8156531 i saw every hallway every child and every smile as i was sharing with my listeners
8156532 it makes you feel good to know you are a part of this
8156533 no s lo han matado a mi hijo tambi n a mi esposa
8156534 t is vijf voor zeven en die van twee huizen verder zijn al bezig
8156535 ik gok op een heggeschaar en die hebben wat hagen amaai

8156537 zal ik daarna wel met de graskantmaaier afkomen de ouwe die snerpt lekker
8156538 krijg ik ineens goesting om heel de oprit eens af te spuiten met de hogedrukreiniger s
8156539 als je haag en de oprit klaar zijn zullen we de auto kuisen ik zoek alvast een tof muziekje voor erbij

8156542 guido schat vanachter is er mij nog een beschadigde boom opgevallen allez binnen dit en twee jaar zal die toch zo rot als snot zijn
8156543 vooruit johan bind onze blackie aan die boom vast in t zicht
8156544 en nodig voor vanavond maar uw collegas uit als die wat op hebben worden die onaangenaam luidruchtig
8156545 only the chinese have the pride discipline the unity of the people amp the unity
8156546 proteasome inhibitors are currently being used to treat some types of cancer including multiple myelomas although many aspects of this cellular process remain poorly understood
8156547 our study sheds new light on how that process works
8156548 we wanted to determine what happens to defective heavy and light chains in plasma cells so we could get a better understanding of the molecules and channels that allow these cells to get rid of defective proteins that cant be used to make antibodies
8156549 the class of cancer drugs called proteasome inhibitors block endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation as well as the destruction of proteins from other parts of the cells and cause defective proteins to overload this system
8156550 we want to fully understand how endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation works for antibodies made by plasma cells so we can design more specific ways to block this process in myelomas
8156551 our study shows for the first time the role herp plays at the retrotranslocon
8156552 the study also describes how non glycosylated proteins are removed from the endoplasmic reticulum and disposed of this information helps to explain how the process works and how we might design ways to block it in cancer cells
8156553 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8156554 actually he was about six blocks away from the pepsi center the crowd behind him was probably no more than a hundred strong and at least one of them was dressed as a toilet a gesture that seemed to have nothing to do with clinton or obama
8156555 but this is how media fantasy gets made a miniature tableau of political discord played out in front of a couple of well placed television cameras and a television host who finds fetishistic hyperbolic meaning in everything having to do with the defeated democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton and her still sore supporters
8156556 in years past democratic candidates who won lots of primaries and accumulated hundreds of delegates sorry howard dean and bill bradley have always been allowed to address the convention and very often place their name into nomination its the norm its expected its a formality
8156557 musik r ingenting isolerat fr n livet fr n det vi erfar upplever och ser

8156559 to see whats happened in this business i dont want to go down with it
8156560 these fast snapshots will let scientists monitor rapidly changing sources
8156561 la combinaci n de tecnolog a de la imagen de la d90 heredada directamente del modelo d300 y las innovadoras funciones como live view pel cula d reconocimiento de escena y control de imagen confirma de nuevo el liderazgo de nikon en lo relacionado con la tecnolog a de la imagen si a esto le a adimos funciones innovadoras y de alto rendimiento como el sensor de im genes cmos y el extremadamente amplio rango de sensibilidad iso estamos convencidos de que esta nueva c mara atraer a todos los fot grafos apasionados que buscan lo ltimo dentro de la fotograf a
8156562 est claramente demostrado que cuando se trata de apoyar a barack obama se al las celebridades que lo respaldan no entienden de l mites en cuanto a campa as difamatorias o ataques
8156563 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
8156564 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
8156565 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
8156566 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
8156567 yeah but lets get to the entrance to our section first
8156568 i know i cant believe it though look at the time
8156569 maybe the noise ordinance kicks in at 10 p m i wish i had triple checked
8156570 at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring or substantive

8156573 estamos creando una coalici n para hacer frente a rusia con m todos diplom ticos pero no se trata de una coalici n militar
8156574 vamos a trabajar utilizando conductos diplom ticos para oponer resistencia a rusia y poner fin a su ocupaci n del territorio de georgia
8156575 soy afortunada el 20 de agosto yo volv a nacer
8156576 si jugamos el f tbol que nos gusta podemos pasar tranquilamente
8156577 estoy muy contenta de estar aqu orgullosa de ser americana y de apoyar a barack obama
8156578 sin importar si votaron por m o por barack este es el momento de unirse como un solo partido con un nico prop sito
8156579 estamos en el mismo equipo y ninguno puede darse el lujo de quedarse a un lado
8156580 mccain ha defendido el pa s con honor pero no necesitamos cuatro a os m s de mandato republicano con m s guerra y menos diplomacia no hemos trabajado tan duro durante los ltimos 18 meses para tener que enfrentarnos a m s l deres fallidos de ninguna manera no con mccain
8156581 queremos crear luchar por america luchar para defender los derechos de las mujeres y los gays proveer ayuda y lo mas importante cuidar de nuestra familia
8156582 recordad que lo primero que debemos de hacer antes de continuar el camino es apoyar a barack obama
8156583 debemos hacer del gobierno una instituci n de todos y no privada trabajaremos por una am rica que haga frente a los retos al terrorismo y a las amenazas globales por todos aquellos que han sido invisibles durante ocho a os por ellos luch como candidata y por eso apoyo a obama
8156584 y quiero que os pregunt is a vosotros mismos si est is en la campa a solo por mi o por aquellas personas en este pa s que se han sentido invisibles durante estos ltimos ocho a os
8156585 no hay l mites de lo que podemos hacer por am rica pero ser imposible si no luchamos juntos para conseguir que los dem cratas lleguen a la casa blanca por eso nos unimos bajo la figura de obama necesitamos un presidente en el que confiemos para solucionar los problemas
8156586 y cuando obama llegue a la casa blanca reavivar la econom a lo hizo antes el ex presidente clinton y lo haremos de nuevo con obama
8156587 todos los que escucharon el discurso que michelle pronunci ayer sabe que ser una genial primera dama norteamericana

8156592 ive known about this for some time that the mossad was involved in murdering our troops in a variety of methods to keep them there so we could finish the job by destroying syria and iran for years now ive suspected and now know for sure the mossad had a lot to do with the 9 11 attack on the wtc the attached mp3 is a recording of nypd radio transmissions on 9 11 listen from the 3 minute mark almost to the end this was never reported in the media
8156593 theres a big truck on king street with the mural of an airplane painted on it diving into new york city and exploding
8156594 unfortunately i dont know any more details about the king st
8156595 these captured israeli mossad agents referring to the five dancing israelis which i wrote about it in
8156596 die betroffene bev lkerung unter ihnen ber 350 000 indigene wurde aber nicht gefragt
8156597 2 day course cloud computing managing services that are in the cloud the itil service management way
8156598 there is a lot more to cloud computing than initial thoughts
8156599 i found this an extremely valuable experience to assist my understanding of cloud computing concepts issues and the processes needed to develop successful migration strategies or implement cloud computing solutions
8156600 the 3 most useful things i have learnt on this course were service level management positioning of cloud computing and seeing opportunities for use in our organsation
8156601 lately there is a lot of media exposure on cloud computing on demand computing and virtualization most of the presentations and articles focus on the technical side of it presenting the newest generation of vmware or the way virtualization of servers can be organised but what about the other side of the story how do you manage the continuity of the services that make use of could computing how do you ensure consistency in service levels how do you choose the best provider of your on demand computing services and that doesnt even touch on information security an important side of any it services especially when it uses the cloud for part of the delivery we felt it was an important step to enable us to become a more rounded organisation in terms of it service management solutions expectations on all of us are increasing and this course gives our clients that additional knowledge to show we are a progressive organisation
8156602 with the right training staff will feel more confident satisfied self reliant and actively communicate more effectively introducing and implementing virtualization and cloud computing training programmes will have a ripple effect throughout a company thus improving morale retention efficiency and productivity
8156603 practical education is at the heart of the art of service
8156604 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8156605 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8156606 your love comes out your hands it all comes out of your hands make me remember who i am
8156607 you should know and you will see the air you breathe across the shining sea youll always be a part of me no matter where you go you will always be a part of me
8156608 madonna seems to be an extraordinarily brilliant business woman in the business of culture
8156609 shes controlled her controversy so every time shes been in controversy it does her good not bad
8156610 outrageous to invoke nazi imagery in the context of john mccains candidacy

8156630 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
8156631 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
8156632 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero

8156836 unannounced visits are even more important in aged care where frail elderly residents are cared for 24 hours a day and are often unable to speak out if they have concerns about their care
8156837 unannounced visits give an accurate picture of a facilitys day to day operation
8156838 unannounced visits are all about the health safety and well being of residents

8156840 i will continue to work in partnership with older australians aged care providers unions and consumer groups to improve the quality in residential aged care and ensure the long term viability of the sector

8156877 i love football so im sure ill be involved in the game in one way shape or form and as i get older management seems the direction that id like to see myself in
8156878 he has fantastic energy and im really delighted hes getting the credit he deserves
8156879 hes got great capabilities in terms of passing making the right runs making the right decisions on the ball and his work rate is phenomenal
8156880 terry is a thick yob who is unfit to lead his country
8156881 i know brian very well and had a good working relationship with him
8156882 the way they england have turned themselves around from michael vaughan and paul collingwood going is exceptional
8156883 but i am fortunate to have four guys bowling at around 90mph and if previous captains had those guys firing on all cylinders at the start of their campaign or whenever it was i am sure they would have been all right
8156884 to have anderson broad flintoff and harmison operating at around 90mph just fills the fielders with so much happiness you know that we can make a bowling change and have a guy coming on and bowling at 90 and that there is another guy waiting to do the same
8156885 from asking the lads to turn up today to finishing at 5 15 is spectacular it is a remarkable victory and one to be enjoyed because we are always the ones on the receiving end of thrashings like that in one day internationals we have never hammered a team as convincingly as that in my time and afterwards i told the lads to go out and enjoy themselves
8156886 it is back to the drawing board this morning he said and we have to work as hard as we have every day so far in this series to win game three and why not four and five the next game is the most important it is a hell of a fixture for us because if we knock them over it will be a great win
8156887 the thing i am trying to drum into matty and the young players is that it is great to be on top of a wave but you have got to get to that level where you are cool and calm and you are responsible
8156888 problems mcclaren alluded to was the intensity of the english season which yesterday forced capello to delay announcing his 23 man squad for the forthcoming world cup qualifiers against andorra and croatia
8156889 i know the problems an england manager has more than anyone else and people are finding that out now said mcclaren whose fc twente side visit arsenal this evening
8156890 the problems will not go away i dont take pleasure seeing england struggle i had great affinity with them for six or seven years
8156891 you the media have given your judgment but it is an over reaction i experienced that and we are experiencing it again
8156892 the qualifiers are yet to come england have a very good manager one of the top managers in the world in capello i wish them good luck in the qualifiers
8156893 it was good to see him get it said mcclaren who appointed terry captain in succession to david beckham after the 2006 world cup
8156894 i had a text from him last week and congratulated him again good choice
8156895 i have not spoken to him yet to wish him good luck said mcclaren
8156896 i know him well and i had a good working relationship with him at the fa
8156897 nothing affects the team when they cross the white line
8156898 its so dutch people can understand explained mcclaren not altogether convincingly
8156899 twente fans were happy about the performance but we have to be angry about the result a 2 0 loss but i wouldnt say it vindicated my decision to come here
8156900 do i have pride at being a high profile english coach abroad no no i am just coaching in holland and trying to make fc twente a success why do more english coaches not go abroad the money is good here they stay for that maybe they dont get the opportunities
8156901 i have not been out of the media spotlight he claimed that he had been greeted positively on his return
8156902 the majority 95 per cent of people are supportive because they can understand said mcclaren indicating that the public recognised the huge problems facing any england coach

8156915 he has not said hes done that how many times have people asked him and he hasnt answered that question
8156916 i hes replied on other forums as recently as yesterday but if he doesnt care enough to answer it then i dont care to continue to debate it
8156917 if he has enough signatures good for him if he doesnt its not douglas fault for pointing it out off to the night shift
8156918 id check into what they explained to me and call the appropriate agencies to find out if what they said is accurate which by the way it is then id get my butt down there and check them not just assume they are right or wrong or that i am right or wrong
8156919 then if i was wrong id try to continue my efforts some other way
8156920 what i wouldnt do is make it seem the like the messenger is the bad guy for pointing out my mistake if i did make a mistake
8156921 which if its true no one is faulting him for
8156922 its his first effort but he has never said whether he checked the signatures against the official data base
8156923 you dont have enough valid signatures you need to withdraw
8156924 oh okay well if you say so then im sorry and i will drop out of the race and go away quietly
8156925 i have checked my signatures and believe them to be valid im not about to withdraw
8156926 hi bigjim i guess well have to agree to disagree because i see it as a heads up before she filed suit to give the kid an out you see it as a threat
8156927 okay whichever you see it as if the kid doesnt have enough valid signatures then hes not a valid candidate standard operating procedure
8156928 somewhere in here somebody says the signatures are validated by someone official but what i found out is that they are not unless someone challenges them so apparently you could go submit a bunch of phony baloney and get on a ballot if no one challenges you
8156929 i suspose if you did this knowingly youd get in trouble somehow but i really dont know adam chose to respond to douglass call by starting this blog but never really telling us if he has actually checked his signatures against a valid data base
8156930 on the afternoon of saturday august 16 2008 i got a very disturbing phone call the call was from peoria unified school district governing board president diane douglas the sole incumbent candidate in this year s school board election
8156931 and bet the house and dog on this there will be a radical right wing republican filing as a write in candidate before the end of the week and they will be part of the douglass political cabal remember maricopa county gop chairman larry pickard a friend of douglas declared just a few years ago that his intent was to take over every school district in the county and starve them of money that systemactic destruction of an excellent school district is happening before your eyes and all you can do is complain about a couple of bloggers you might want to start looking into a priviate school for your kids now
8156932 they did it to ask me how i am doing in the venezuelan domestic league and what my situation will be in december
8156933 they can offer a contract for several years but i dont know who the team is
8156934 i have only spoken with him aparicio i havent spoken with anyone of wigan or other teams
8156935 i would like to be called by a coach because that would make me certain that i will have the chance to play
8156936 i have also been called from mexico to ask me if i am interested in going back there but i havent been told the name of the team

8156941 offensive and misleading because it implied that small newsagents were involved in the drugs industry
8156942 the experience of uk police officers was that some criminality had been found in a small number of retail and business outlets
8156943 you will discover sides to your community you never knew existed youll be in a position to improve peoples lives by helping reduce crime and just as importantly the fear of crime
8156944 suggesting that small or local newsagents were likely to be involved in the drugs industry
8156945 any way that we can get people to sample stanford football is something we need to explore

8156996 they said that i need to come prepared because theres a good chance i could play early there
8156997 i really like how they always seem to prepare their players well for the next level
8156998 im really impressed with what hes done at rutgers and i think theyll continue to win

8157064 better that a truck hit one of these things than hit a bridge
8157065 i think that this has reached the point where weve got to remove the barriers to truck barriers
8157066 is a violation of state and federal standards and so i would be very reluctant to do anything until the state and federal government modify their standards to allow it
8157067 does not authorize height bar restrictions commonly used in parking garages to be used as traffic control devices
8157068 we phased them out a number of years ago due to liability issues
8157069 if a truck hits one of these structures and suffers damages were actually responsible

8157073 had made the decision to seize the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali despite the fact that its forces did not have enough anti tank and air defenses to protect themselves against the possibility of serious resistance
8157074 unfortunately we attached a low priority to this we did not prepare for this kind of eventuality i didnt think it likely that a member of the un security council and the osce would react like this
8157075 we said dont do it dont be drawn into a military conflict its not in your interest
8157076 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
8157077 the most incredible opportunity any president and vice president will have since franklin roosevelt
8157078 that all changed in 1960 when kennedy chose lyndon johnson as his running mate
8157079 will make the next president cautious about giving the vice president too much authority
8157080 one thing is clear biden does nothing to brighten obamas prospects in the electoral college
8157081 if for some reason obama is incapacitated or perish the thought dies in office people know he would be a competent president
8157082 the office of vice president has changed forever the office has explicit legal powers now maybe some will be rolled back but they cant be rolled back easily the template of being a big player in foreign affairs is established
8157083 all vice presidents since walter mondale vice president from 1977 81 have played a more important role than had historically been the case i look for biden to play a role more like al gore to clinton
8157084 hes a rudder he has a handle on the bureaucracy and knows how to get things done
8157085 today is an extremely sad day for the trail blazers family
8157086 kevin will be remembered by fans as one of the most popular and recognizable players to ever wear the blazers uniform but to people who knew him hell be remembered as one of the warmest and biggest hearted

8157095 your purpose isnt to know god your purpose is to win souls thats what you are here on earth to do be a witness and win others to christ
8157096 many jews can no longer subscribe to the biblical idea of god who manifests himself in history who they say with wiesel died in auschwitz
8157097 islam is a religion of success the koran taught that a society which lived according to gods will implementing justice equality and a fair distribution of wealth could not fail muslim history had seemed to confirm this unlike christ muhammad had not been an apparent failure but a dazzling success his achievements had been compounded by the phenomenal advance of the muslim empire during the seventh and eighth centuries this had naturally seemed to endorse the muslim faith in god al lah had proved to be extremely effective and had made good his word in the arena of history now however something seemed to have gone radically wrong with muslim history and this inevitably affected the perception of god
8157098 for someone who wants to watch the game you are either going to watch on a big screen at home or in a pub
8157099 the screen was too small and the action too fast for the handset and the picture was often pixelated
8157100 and this is certainly a complementary service something for people who are on the go and unable to watch games live on a big screen but it is successful
8157101 our experience has been very good and shows that the german bundesliga is our most popular video content
8157102 it has helped us attract customers to our other video channels
8157103 there is a huge quality difference between watching a sporting event on a big screen versus a tiny mobile phone

8157133 a new party has come into existence today under the leadership of chiranjeevi in democracy everybody has a right to form party but we have already done everything what new can they offer
8157134 he has a right to form a party we are not afraid of that congress is a 123 year old party and is still very relevant
8157135 chiranjeevi has not spelt out his stand on key issues confronting the state

8157140 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8157141 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8157142 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8157143 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8157144 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8157145 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8157146 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8157147 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8157148 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8157149 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8157150 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8157151 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8157152 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8157153 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8157154 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8157155 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8157156 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8157157 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8157158 i just dont want it to open up pandoras box with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8157159 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement
8157160 what well obviously do is look at it after the world series were hopeful that were going to say it was great
8157161 we talked to the technicians and he explained what theyre going to be doing

8157173 if barack obama werent so pathetic he would be funny but he isnt hes prickish and offensive and like the majority of his kind he pompously presumes to be the exact remedy for the ills he perceives america has and more tragically while he speaks in oblique references pursuant to his intentions for the redistribution of wealth should he be elected it appears his own siblings will have to wait because obamas plans for largesse of other peoples wealth to his so called least of these doesnt extend to his personal family when it is his dollars one can hardly be condemned for questioning why someone with obamas connections and a combined income of approximately 5 million annually allows his half brother george to live in a mud hut in nairobi on less than 12 thats right less than 12 a year

8157175 we chose cisco because of its proven expertise and leadership in networking technology we now realize that we have made the right choice and are well on schedule thanks to the innovative features of ciscos wimax solutions and the support from their local regional and global teams
8157176 cisco is pleased to be given this opportunity to be part of the first operational rollout of a wimax network in thailand mobile wimax enables high speed broadband services to be deployed in remote and rugged environments like chiang rai which will help bridge the digital divide in thailand once the project is completed the staff and students in mae fah luang university will be able to enjoy a richer educational environment that will fully employ voice video data and mobility services over the wimax network
8157177 we believe that wimax will change the malaysian broadband landscape and the way we live learn work and play and lay the foundation towards achieving malaysias national broadband plan and myicms 886 objectives because of the very strong proposition of the wimax eco system known as the dna device network and applications are all in place

8157188 yeah only your speech was a little longer than mine
8157189 were not going to find out standing around lets go
8157190 we dont even know anything about your new powers yet
8157191 crittone stop sometimes matoran are destined to become toa this is a good thing

8157197 when i first went on the court i was very excited and i started to play really well
8157198 obviously the lack of practice showed a little bit later
8157199 were not set up to go out and do the great big fight in one night it takes us several nights to go out and catch up
8157200 i live on the bay side and i cant even sit on my deck
8157201 were not set up to go out and do the great big fight in one night it takes us several nights to go out and catch up
8157202 i live on the bay side and i cant even sit on my deck
8157203 i cant walk out to the bird feeder without having my legs completely covered with them
8157204 i was talking to my sister districts and theyre all scrambling too trying to catch up with these things hopefully by the weekend it will be better i wont say theyll be gone but hopefully theyll be better
8157205 he said he is feeling better and is ready to go home
8157206 he was not totally unconscious but it was hurting him he was moving his arms when they took him away on the stretcher
8157207 a witness near him saw what he believed was a spark of electricity between him and the tool he was reaching for
8157208 a few guys saw it but im not sure if it hit him or right beside him
8157209 one of the guys said it hit the top of his head but i didnt see his shoes messed up
8157210 i knew it hit somewhere i could tell it was close then everybody started yelling and i ran over there
8157211 part of the roof was knocked off and it landed on braniff road and knocked down some power lines

8157213 when i learned that these men volunteer for this dangerous work and often grow so fond of it that they can imagine doing nothing else i knew what my next film was going to be about
8157214 ive always had a fascination with the older generation particularly those who are not at ease with the ageing process
8157215 i always thought 30 stolen bases was a big chunk i didnt think it was possible
8157216 well if i keep taking pitches he will reach 30 stolen bases
8157217 hes fast but hes also smart he reads pitchers well
8157218 this is the fastest i have ever felt in my career so if i get a good jump i should make it
8157219 and talking to willy and pods helps they pay closer attention to it than i do because its such a big part of their game
8157220 when you have an umpire running out trying to see a ball 300 feet away it was impossible
8157221 why wait if they have technology they should do it right now
8157222 its really hard because if the umpire loses the ball for one second you cant pick it back up
8157223 its probably only going to happen once every two weeks so i think those extra two minutes are worth getting a very important call right
8157224 i think to wait until the postseason that struck me as awkward
8157225 its not einsteins theory of relativity the technology is wired theres so much evidence that its the right thing to do theres no reason not to implement it
8157226 but most of them know theyre not here to make it rich
8157227 they will be tempted there are people out there who are all over those guys
8157228 i compliment mendenhall and rose for what they are doing here as long as it lasts
8157229 i would have been out of a job within a few years if id gone to detroit
8157230 its not so much that were trying to measure up against anyone else
8157231 what i try to do is keep in communication with coaches to keep them coaching here they are good coaches who could undoubtedly make more money elsewhere and someday that might happen
8157232 one theres a notion that some portion of your time needs to be service in that is implied some sacrifice relative to what you might get elsewhere second they want to be fair and give sufficient for your needs third something unique over the past four or five years theres a willingness to entertain and discuss what the market is like out there
8157233 as we talk its not me me me its we we we
8157234 with what were doing here at an lds church owned school its probably not appropriate to pay a coach 2 million but byu president cecil samuelson has been supportive
8157235 the only way i can look at it is are coaches happy here thats an ongoing thing we keep talking
8157236 if you cant get up emotionally and mentally when youre two or three games out of first place you need to find another job another occupation
8157237 thats what i see ive seen teams play like this when theyre 30 games out theres no excuse for it

8157262 the situation with robbie is still up in the air so he wont be involved against grimsby
8157263 these things do take time especially when the agent gets involved
8157264 im not unsure about robbie im just unsure as to when it will get done
8157265 there is no deadline though because he is a free agent and not tied down to the transfer window
8157266 andre ooijer and roque santa cruz played 90 minutes for their national teams last week and again against hull at the weekend
8157267 i shall not be bringing in anyone today or tomorrow so for now everyone should be concentrating on the job in hand and that is making sure that liverpool reach the group stages
8157268 the team have forgotten the match in liege it was just a bad day and we are thinking about qualifying at anfield
8157269 for liverpool the champions league is a huge competition and it would be a disaster not to get through
8157270 nobody in the squad is thinking about anything other than qualifying i am always optimistic and i am convinced we will beat standard
8157271 but there are no easy games in europe and we are aware that this match is not decided
8157272 i am not even considering the option of liverpool not qualifying for the group stages i am just thinking about winning
8157273 my concern now is to improve how we play we can play better liege were good in the first leg but we were really poor
8157274 if we improve and play at our real level it will be very difficult for them
8157275 liege are probably the hardest opponents we have faced in champions league qualifiers but we know we are better than them even though they played well in the first leg
8157276 at anfield we are confident we can win and i expect us to win the key is to be calm and confident in your team and the ability of your players we have the players who can win this type of game
8157277 whatever happens it will not really disrupt my transfer plans we are so close to the end of the window things will not change
8157278 but yes i am aware of the financial implications of liverpool not qualifying money is really important but that is always the situation in football
8157279 that is a danger to be complacent but there is so much at stake it would be criminal not to be focused
8157280 it is either being in the group stages on friday or being out
8157281 anything can happen at that level because we had a very difficult first leg but it cannot be just because you were taking this game lightly
8157282 the tie is not dead because you could see from the first leg how quickly we could score two goals from nothing

8157349 this man anwar can convince even the devil to follow him
8157350 the permatang pauh by election results is a clear message for barisan nasional umno and its leaders within five months after the march 8 polls barisan lost the seat again with a bigger majority than the last time
8157351 this is not only because the by election was held in permatang pauh and one of the candidates was anwar ibrahim i believe this will be the trend at other places as well and those who came out to vote on tuesday had voted for the opposition
8157352 i dont think abdullah is a match for anwar this man anwar can convince even the devil to follow him he is going to raise all kinds of issues and questions and will demand and pressure the prime minister for answers it is going to be a tough time for barisan
8157353 the people sent a message at the march 8 polls and again in the permatang pauh by election leaders should sit up and take stock of this they want changes and they want it quick not in june 2010
8157354 if changes are made two years from now then umno will face an uphill task to gain strength and the peoples confidence if they fail to do so then barisan can expect defeat in the 13th general election
8157355 we took a sample and discovered 80 employees had filed approximately 170 claims
8157356 thats an average of two or more claims per employee that seems very excessive
8157357 and more than half of the claims were single vehicle accidents many involved windshield damage which appeared to be excessive that just seems very high
8157358 the review found we were lax in our fiscal oversight and authorized a number of reimbursements without ensuring the required procedures were followed
8157359 this failure to follow procedure negatively impacts our integrity as a fiscally responsible agency this is especially troublesome at a time when we are expecting reductions in our county and department budget
8157360 we have over 3 000 social workers who are responsible for visiting children in their homes schools and communities and interacting with approximately 35 000 children under the supervision of the county
8157361 as a result there are a lot of individuals on the highways but we dont know if all of these were legitimate or if fraud has been committed but the action plan we have instituted will reveal that
8157362 one employee submitted four claims in one year all single vehicle accidents totaling approximately 6 000
8157363 the employees vehicle required minor bumper repairs for 1 100 which included eight hours of labor
8157364 for example an employee approved her own field itinerary by signing her supervisors name and putting her initials next to the signature

8157472 so it was pleasing the way the young guys had a real dig and finished the game strongly
8157473 we knew that every game would be a challenge and leinster have clearly got some world class players but at the end of the day this tours not about going through undefeated its about setting guys up for super 14 in two or three years time so its certainly serving the purpose for us there

8157519 maybe if the live action star wars tv series goes ahead i might try and wheedle my way back into the affections of lucasfilm and write an episode
8157520 the weird thing and i think this goes for both star trek and doctor who is that neither of them are remakes i often see star trek being referred to as a remake and it really isnt its another star trek film its another movie in the series its the continuing mission
8157521 doctor who is like that as well and because of the nature of how doctor who evolves you become part of that tradition rather than a re handling of it
8157522 both of those are perfect examples of taking the spirit of the original material and entirely maintaining it

8157551 on the al jazeera english web site the analysis of biden presented by marwan bishara senior political analyst was seriously flawed factually and poorly researched

8157572 perch larabo una lingua morta come leggere un testo in latino
8157573 perch lidea di scrivere un libro erotico in arabo una cosa naturale con la sterminata eredit che abbiamo in materia la nostra una civilt talmente raffinata sulle questioni relative al corpo e alla sessualit che quello che arrivato tradotto nelle lingue occidentali veramente poca cosa
8157574 lislam accetta la sessualit come un aspetto normativo sia della vita ordinaria sia di quella religiosa
8157575 nella cultura araba non c colpa nel sesso il sesso libert nella vita sociale di oggi c anzitutto uno scarto una distanza tra la pratica e la legge religiosa
8157576 la liberazione esiste gi la letteratura non fa altro che esprimerla se guardiamo le societ arabe in maniera superficiale vediamo solo donne velate e religione se invece osserviamo pi nel profondo quello che sta succedendo ci accorgiamo che contemporaneamente sono le stesse relazioni tra uomo e donna che stanno cambiando in libano in algeria in giordania ma anche nelle societ pi tradizionali e si tratta di cambiamenti radicali
8157577 quella che passa in europa unimmagine stereotipata unimmagine altra delle societ arabe
8157578 societ che sono invece diverse multiple complesse un esempio per tutti la donna musulmana la figura unica della donna musulmana non esiste cos come non esiste il clich dello hammam per gli arabi andare allo hammam normale come se andassero al caff un gesto della vita quotidiana

8157583 our stockpile of ribbons needs to be refreshed so were hoping to get a whole lot of people in to build up those supplies
8157584 were really trying to get people to take up a table get some friends involved and all come down to listen to some djs and have some snacks and drinks while they put together some ribbons
8157585 theres nothing confronting about putting together ribbons the worst youre going to get is a prick on the finger so it will be a lot of fun and there will be prizes throughout the day for the neatest ribbons and the tables that manage to produce the most
8157586 theres no obligation for anyone to sell them once weve put them together though that would be great if they wanted to obviously the aim is to make 50 000 and then sell every one of them
8157587 up until relatively recently the resilience of the german economy was a very important theme in the debate about the outlook for the euro area economy and by implication ecb interest rates in gdp terms the economy surged ahead by 1 3 q q in the first three months of the year admittedly with some though certainly not all of this strength due to a weather induced spike in construction activity this resilience was also evident in the ifo index of german business confidence a closely followed and timely indicator used as a proxy for the business cycle indeed as recently as may of this year the ifo index while down modestly from its end 06 peak was still actually above the highest level reached at the top of the last economic cycle in 99 00 but weak q2 gdp data and an unprecedented fall in the ifo confidence index give cause for concern however both the latest national accounts report and recent readings of the ifo confirm that the situation has changed materially in recent months this morning s detailed national accounts report confirmed output fell by 0 5 in the second quarter in line with last week s preliminary estimate the expenditure breakdown revealed in today s report highlighted the broad based weakness which pulled growth into negative territory in the last quarter investment declined by1 9 q q following a very strong q1 in which it rose by 3 4 but perhaps the most worrisome element of the report relates to ongoing weakness in household spending private consumption was down 0 7 in the three months to june while the q1 outcome was also revised down significantly from 0 3 to 0 4 this marked the third consecutive quarter of contraction for household spending and the weakest sequence since at least the early 1990s that this has happened against the backdrop of the unemployment rate falling to its lowest level since the early 1990s casts more than a little doubt over the ability of consumption to meaningfully drive a sustained expansion in germany
8157588 so after the evans fight i want the title shot yeah i was asked about fighting forrest when he won the ultimate fighter three years ago and i said hes not ready and id beat him up but hes ready now and it would be a great fight
8157589 i want to fight rampage real badly i actually think i match up very well against him but ive managed to lose to him twice now
8157590 but the third fight will not have anything to do with the first two it will be a fresh start rampage is the one fight i really want as much as i want my title back
8157591 hes lost the belt now so i cant beat him and win the title back in one fight but i want to fight him just as bad as when he was champion
8157592 many international people are moving to dublin to take advantage of the good economic situation
8157593 even when poland joined the eu in 2005 many gay poles flooded into dublin
8157594 as i talk to my friends more and more gay boys now feel comfortable enough to come out of the closet at a younger age
8157595 gay was never talked about when i was a child i cant ever remember anyone saying my son is gay it was not open to discussion
8157596 i heard that gays would go to hell that really turned me off
8157597 religion is the biggest headache gay people face in ireland
8157598 i believe equality for same sex couples can be achieved through a diversity of legal arrangements we should proceed now to bring in a law that will give recognition and protection to same sex couples who are involved in loving stable relationships
8157599 it wouldnt be appreciated if i got married in belfast my family wouldnt be impressed and probably wouldnt come to the wedding
8157600 i saw on the television show australia uncovered a segment about the gay scene in sydney and how open it was it looked so amazing
8157601 sydney has been better than expected i am free to do whatever i want australia has given me the courage to be me to be stronger
8157602 at first when i was younger i was really inspired by sophie ellis bextor and the way she did pop and disco
8157603 i also loved early madonna and of course kylie i love what she created with her own image and i think its beautiful
8157604 the gay community seems to really appreciate how i make my shows colourful and artsy i also have a lot of dancers and wear unique outfits
8157605 im very much all for the music and the lyrics are very important to make the music sound how i want it to
8157606 i love to do the dance disco pop stuff at the moment a lot of dance songs are being released without heart and soul with cry for you you really feel the tears in the lyrics and the deeper meaning of the track i love the sound of desperation you can hear in it
8157607 there would be people who have been practising for weeks in the lead up to this
8157608 there are couples who take it very seriously but that doesnt mean that people who are new to dancing should feel left out there are special rounds on the night where new dancers can register to dance with a more experienced person we want them to join in on the night everyone can have a go its not as hard as you think
8157609 the sounds are deeper but they still have plenty of soul and groove and most importantly are uplifting
8157610 when i was writing it i was really sick of seeing on gaydar profiles straight acting only no fems no faggots its so self defeating and self loathing
8157611 i think its the biggest issue we fight in the gay community this internalised homophobia its okay to be yourself whoever that is if youre a stereotype if youre a gay clich then own it
8157612 but he did have a little glitter l on the back of those camouflage shorts
8157613 i think we went a little bit overboard in the costume department with all of lukes jewellery and stuff casper filmmaker said at one point why are you putting so much jewellery on no one is going to believe that someone like stephen his love interest is going to be into this flamer
8157614 i was like thats the whole point of the film stephens attracted to luke because he is so unabashedly himself and stephen is unable to be himself
8157615 each year at our agm our members vote on which charities they would like to donate to if we manage to turn a profit
8157616 it just so happened that we had a really good year so all of our charities the glcs the luncheon club and monicas doggy rescue all received 2 500
8157617 the glcs was this year once again voted as one of our charities of choice i think for our members its important because we can all remember what its like to be young and coming out and want to do what we can to help people
8157618 this season we are hoping to have 11 teams play in the competition that is over 160 players
8157619 the competition is open to both men and women and is all inclusive
8157620 were hoping that the social game at the sports day out might get some new people interested in playing softball this summer
8157621 they can come and have a hit and see what they think it really doesnt matter how good people are this competition is open to all levels
8157622 we will be organising a couple of training sessions on a sunday once the season starts for new players and others who wish to fine tune their skills
8157623 we intend to make this the most successful season for sydney outfielders which would be fitting with the celebratory factor of 10 years in existence
8157624 we want to continue encouraging the gay and lesbian community including transgender and bisexual people to participate in both the competitive and non competitive aspects of being a part of this softball group
8157625 there is a sense of togetherness fun and support our players offer each other both on and off the field
8157626 hello darling ive got a mouthful at the moment but its not what you think
8157627 well hes attempting to direct me i can be a handful
8157628 im known for my crowd surfing and such but this will be a new take on it there is a trapeze i perform with a band and theyre quite an exquisite gypsy punk orchestra this piece is all original music written by the divine iain grandage with lyrics doggerel by me
8157629 i align my show to what real cabaret is which is fairly without rules and is really based on an intimacy with the audience thats the beauty for me of live performance political cabaret is always dealing with the body and with sexuality for me the body is always going to be interesting whether its to do with censorship or repression of the body its all sadly relevant
8157630 theres so much thats utterly predictable in television and films and we keep missing the point of live flesh in a space what could happen you can just walk out and leave i could just pass out on stage or i could lie on the floor and cry for the whole show
8157631 i have to laugh at myself and i get terribly distressed about the state of the world so i have to try and find a balance with that i guess i live my life on stage as i do off im open
8157632 well sometimes the island of the gays likes to label but i think most of us are into a more fluid system of existence arent we
8157633 were committed to entertaining people well be presenting some of our favourite arias and ensembles from opera as well as some more popular songs which we love to sing
8157634 first and foremost the idea in putting on this concert is for the five of us dominica matthews shannon foley barry ryan david miller and me to have some fun performing together some of our favourite music
8157635 this is the whole point of performance to come together as friends and colleagues and entertain the public for a few hours if you can do this and at the same time help to give back to the next round of young singers coming through the ranks then thats also fantastic
8157636 each of the different characters in the play represents a different aspect of that narcissistic culture that has arisen
8157637 the thesis of the play i suppose is that were comprehensively narcissistic at the moment everyone it seems is interested in this gratification of the self and the cult of the young beautiful self who values things over intimacy
8157638 its been surprising its definitely struck a chord that i didnt expect
8157639 there seems to be something about the immediacy of the pop cultural references that has connected with audiences but i think the core idea that people are connecting to is the idea of intimacy the fact that all of these people are being driven by a fear of being left behind and stranded at the altar
8157640 the play is about the search for intimacy and a whole range of fears which have been interesting to explore through a gay character just a decade ago you wouldnt have seen a central gay character at all let alone being the medium through which you would explore these sorts of anxieties but i think thats changing and its definitely something i want to work towards and get more central gay characters up on the stage

8157650 it was great to come fourth but it was agony
8157651 to have something here in my hand to bring home would be fantastic the line between success and failure is so small out there
8157652 i know how it feels to be branded a failure on the back of two 90 second runs after putting in four years of hard graft branded by people who are only interested in you for a few weeks
8157653 so i know how others are feeling here today and i know how difficult it is for them
8157654 and when you come home and you see scenes like this it does sink in that youve missed out you dont need to be told
8157655 i just want to say thank you on behalf of the people of the country to all of you the athletes for the sheer excitement for the rollercoaster you brought us all on for the joys to the highs to the lows the upsets to all the different levels of emotions that is brought during such a fantastic spectacle

8157927 that process is in line with the procedures established by the previous government on the consideration of visa applicants he said
8157928 mr broadus has not been granted a visa there are further steps required beyond character assessment before a visa is granted
8157929 the department has now decided to do a full assessment of the character of mr broadus
8157930 community complaints have no effect on the grant or otherwise of a visa each application is assessed individually on its merits a spokesman said
8157931 as a result of public concern and interest the department has decided that in fact we will be undertaking a more thorough assessment of mr broadus character
8157932 however the decision on the granting or refusal of a visa application is made on the individual merit of the case consistent with the legal criteria for the class of the visa bizarre case

8157952 i like it better when a lot of people are playing at once
8157953 you dont have everyone listening so you can kind of focus

8157955 the kids really are mature for being young and i think that comes with the discipline of learning an instrument
8157956 i aced it it was really good that was probably my best audition ever
8157957 i was just pretending i was practicing in front of my dog
8157958 its a week of hearing a lot of very talented kids play and theyre under a lot of pressure

8157971 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8157972 you owe me nothing thank you all for allowing me to be a part of this
8157973 im not getting massive success with the marketing ive done so far in fact not one person has called
8157974 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8157975 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win
8157976 she struck the right sentiments and demonstrated some real emotion
8157977 whether its a career in the u s senate to be the equivalent of a ted kennedy a sort of uber senator or whether its to maintain her viability so if obama loses she doesnt even have to say i told you so and shes the front runner for next time
8157978 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him
8157979 were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8157980 its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8157981 whether its a trip to the zoo with the first grade or a trip to china with a group of high school students theres always an anxiety
8157982 i definitely think it could impact some peoples willingness to chaperone
8157983 if we decided not to have any insurance at some point a year or two from now some parents might say they cant take the risks
8157984 many parents do chaperone and dont think a thing about it for a second
8157985 almost everything a school does involves some amount of risk

8157992 i believe that the reason we find sunsets so fascinating is because we are capable of seeing them in an ever changing perfection
8157993 how do we gather knowledge about how societies came to operate the way they do we cant travel in time and observe how complex networks evolved but we can collect organise and interpret their remains and we can apply what we learn from the past to help us address pressing issues we face today
8157994 we look at objects ranging from cooking wares and coins to wall paintings and loom weights we trace the links between the people who made used and taught others to make them
8157995 by investigating many crafts we explore the impact different technologies had on each other for example making a cooking pot isnt so easy how do craft workers come up with good recipes shapes and firing techniques for making convenient heat resistant pottery
8157996 where do they source their materials and sell their wares and how do the recipes themselves travel change and improve
8157997 by studying the connectivity of ancient craft production and exchange we aim to find good metaphors for new modalities of interaction and production in global ubiquitous computing by harnessing the past we aim to find new solutions for future computational systems that can operate in resource limited environments

8157999 bisher ist abb noch nicht sehr stark im solargesch ft verwurzelt
8158000 wir sp ren keine zur ckhaltung beim investitionsverhalten unserer kunden
8158001 wir sind zuversichtlich dass sich alle unsere kernm rkte weiterhin sehr positiv entwickeln
8158002 solange sich eine rezession auf eine weltregion beschr nkt k nnen wir damit recht gut umgehen
8158003 wenn sich allerdings auch das wachstum in europa verlangsamen sollte bliebe dies f r die m rkte in fernost und damit auch f r abb nicht ohne folgen
8158004 wir wollen beispielsweise in allen divisionen unser servicegesch ft ausbauen da es wenig kapitalintensiv und kaum zyklisch ist
8158005 wir rechnen damit bereits mitte des n chsten jahres die gewinnzone zu erreichen
8158006 es gibt eine konsolidierung am ende werden nur zwei oder drei plattformen brig bleiben
8158007 die halbjahreszahlen 2008 zeigen dass wir den nettoerl s gesteigert und den ebit deutlich verbessert haben
8158008 am 1 oktober 2008 werde ich zusammen mit mitarbeitern die firma jma j rg maurer asset management ag starten
8158009 es gibt einzelne f lle wo wir von reisen in regionen ausserhalb liechtensteins abraten
8158010 generell gilt dass ausl ndische offshore kunden f r gesch ftskontakte in die schweiz kommen
8158011 nach 2009 wird f r die pr mienzahler kostenwahrheit folgen dann werden die versicherungspr mien kostendeckend sein m ssen
8158012 eine zusammenarbeit etwa in der beschaffung wird gepr ft aber das hat nichts mit einer beteiligung zu tun

8158017 die ascom i75 ger te sind robust und zuverl ssig und eigenen sich ideal f r unser tracking system
8158018 die integration von ekahau in die ascom vowifi ger te war einfach und geradlinig da ihr system auf dem ieee 802 11 wifi standard beruht wir freuen uns sehr dar ber unseren kunden jetzt diese sichere nachverfolgungsl sung anbieten zu k nnen die die pers nliche sicherheit ihrer mitarbeiter erh ht

8158020 dar ber hinaus haben wir in den zur ckliegenden jahren einen wesentlichen kontinuierlich weiter wachsenden bestand an wartungserl sen aufgebaut die serviceleistungen der saf nehmen im zuge einer gestiegen kundennachfrage nach analyse und implementierungsleistungen weiter zu
8158021 aerial photography gives us important intelligence for managing the response to incidents and investigating incident scenes
8158022 although it is early days of implementation within our command and control operations we feel it will be a great asset in ensuring we can optimise resources and provide a fast and effective response
8158023 it is not always possible to obtain aerial views of an ongoing incident scene
8158024 weather conditions lack of helicopter resources or risk issues are common so this data will become an invaluable resource
8158025 wear valley successfully used ibs systems for a number of years so i was confident that deploying ibs openworkflow and dip was the best way forward
8158026 ibs openworkflow offered considerable scope for efficiency gains because it integrates fully with openrevenues this allows all information on a customer file to be accessed on one screen the system ensures that with over 2 500 new claims and changes in circumstances each month there is little requirement for manual data entry
8158027 the conversion of data onto the ibs dip system for wear valley and teesdales newly integrated benefits services was very efficient
8158028 data conversion to the new system happened overnight there was very little downtime once staff are fully versed with the system i expect to see some strong efficiency results
8158029 cynical and calculated attempt to divert police and public attention from the governments u turn on the democratic rights of police officers

8158032 there isnt a note or anything in the elevator stating that
8158033 well i got on the elevator on the 3rd floor and there was no note in the elevator there
8158034 you do realize it is the same elevator on all floors right
8158035 wir haben chiltern early phase mit der vision gegr ndet eine marke zu entwickeln die mit qualit t und ausgezeichneten serviceleistungen synonym ist wir verf gen nun ber das team die organisation und die einrichtungen um diese vision in die realit t umzusetzen und usserst fachkundige fr hphasen dienstleistungen zu angemessenen kosten anzubieten
8158036 ich bin hoch erfreut dar ber dass die integration so gr ndlich und fr her als geplant abgeschlossen werden konnte wir freuen uns nun darauf auf der langen liste wissenschaftlicher und medizinischer erfolge unseres gesch ftsbereichs aufzubauen dabei richten wir unsere anstrengungen sowohl auf bereiche in denen wir traditionell stark vertreten sind als auch auf neue spezialisierungsbereiche wie diabetes und kardiovaskul re medizin wir erwarten ausserdem die etablierung von beziehungen mit akademischen einrichtungen um fachstudien mit neuen biomarkern durchzuf hren
8158037 from 60 sites at present there should be no more than 20 in the future
8158038 we are counting among other things on people taking early retirement
8158039 theyve both made strides the last couple of weeks and theyre closer now than theyve ever been
8158040 our goal with them is hopefully both of them will be ready to play and well play both
8158041 well be running the same plays with both in there
8158042 were just wanting guys to execute the system and not make turnovers and make plays when there are opportunities to make them its the first game everything is going to happen fast to them
8158043 were accounting for all different roles in the spread offense
8158044 we expect them to be fast and good players if theyre on scholarship at michigan theyre going to be a good player
8158045 its as much as youd expect for the first year
8158046 our thing is we have to be careful we have inexperienced players and we have to teach fundamentals and schemes we wont have as much in early as we will later in the year or years to come but we have enough that our players are comfortable with it
8158047 it is i think the best offensive line since ive been at byu when you look across the board when you look at the experience and the ability
8158048 i think it could end up being the best one that ive been around that ive been fortunate enough to work with
8158049 i mean we are just big and athletic and the guys understand the offense and they are smart
8158050 we could have the best o line in the conference maybe the country theyre great
8158051 hes inexperienced i guess but hes a very fast learner
8158052 there will be some learning curve and there will be some mistakes he will make young mistakes but he is very mature and he is older than the average freshman and he is very talented
8158053 i am just trying to get it down obviously there is a lot to learn it is a challenge but i like it i have a lot of people around me helping me out so i should be ok
8158054 i think it is a six man line with willing the first backup in and then theres a seventh and eighth coming
8158055 a bunch of meth heads put together i dont know what they do
8158056 there is no credible threat right now and there was no credible threat
8158057 could not believe how close he obama was to becoming president
8158058 lapindo tidak salah dalam eksplorasi karena di bawah permukaan tanah memang benar ada minyak yang dicari
8158059 tapi lapindo tidak tahu ada dimana titik diapir itu apalagi lapindo tidak menggunakan casing padahal dua hari sebelumnya 27 5 2006 terjadi gempa di jogjakarta
8158060 pengeboran tanpa casing untuk permukaan bawah tanah yang memiliki diapir akan berbahaya
8158061 tanpa adanya casing membuat lumpur yang berasal dari endapan darat dari kedalaman 4 000 6 000 kaki itu akhirnya meluap dari rongga di kawasan yang banyak memiliki patahan itu
8158062 titik diapir itu akan menyembur meluap dengan sendirinya bila terjadi gesekan dan tekanan tapi belum tentu terkait dengan gempa di yogyakarta karena gempa jogjakarta pada 27 mei 2006 berjarak jauh dari lumpur lapindo yang muncul pada 29 mei 2006
8158063 teknik seperti itu tidak dikenal apalagi surat medco pemegang saham nomer mgt 088 jkt 06 sudah bocor ke media massa bahwa medco pada 18 mei 2006 sudah mengingatkan lapindo operator untuk konsisten pada program yaitu memasang casing 9 5 8 inchi di kedalaman 8 500 kaki melindungi lubang 3 580 8 500 kaki

8158065 local councils up and down the country first agreed to carry out equal pay evaluations in 1997 but it has taken them 10 years to do anything about it
8158066 thankfully things seem to be getting sorted in chorley now but there could have been a lot more people claiming
8158067 nevertheless the employees that have followed it up will hopefully get what they are owed in the next couple of months considering the council makes a sensible offer
8158068 our order book is in excellent shape to reach full year underlying revenue growth of around 6 percent in the medium term we work towards our adjusted operating margin objective of over 12 5 percent
8158069 gezien de huidige koers van gustav maken we logistieke plannen om personeel te evacueren dat niet essentieel is voor productie of booroperaties
8158070 ik weet niet of we aan het eind van het jaar kunnen zeggen dat we cashflow positief zijn geweest
8158071 we blijven met vechtlust kijken naar acquisitiemogelijkheden als de kans zich voordoet zullen we er bovenop spingen
8158072 kijkend naar de nettoschuldpositie van 1 2 ruim onder de doelstelling van maximaal 3 is er meer dan voldoende ruimte voor verder groei
8158073 er is veel consolidatie in onze sector veel bedrijven bieden zich aan het is alleen nog niet gelukt een goede match te vinden
8158074 de belangrijkste voorwaarde om dividend uit te keren is dat we winst maken
8158075 daarnaast moet de solvabiliteit minimaal 35 bedragen om 30 van de winst uit te keren in de vorm van dividend
8158076 jaime prendi fuego a aerol neas y quiere aparecer ahora como bombero salvador
8158077 prendi fuego a la empresa y quiere aparecer ahora como el bombero salvador

8158079 responsables de que el pa s tenga que hacerse cargo de los restos del titanic
8158080 no quiere ni necesita saber c mo va el mercado a reo argentino

8158084 no le ha permitido sobrevivir la ha tenido asfixiada con falta de actualizaciones de tarifas con una posici n absolutamente radical en cuanto al movimiento de aerol neas
8158085 tienen una gran culpa por supuesto los propietarios actuales de aerol neas argentinas es decir el grupo marsans porque no ha sabido conducirse la compa a con un criterio empresarial adecuado a la situaci n
8158086 est compartida la culpa las dos partes son responsables de haber llevado a la compa a a una situaci n para que el pa s tenga que absorber algo
8158087 jaime es el culpable sino es al cien por ciento por lo menos el 50 por ciento
8158088 no han sabido manejar la compa a eso es evidente
8158089 la deuda de aerol neas es m vil aumenta cada d a
8158090 cuando se haga una auditor a ver n que la deuda es mucho mayor que lo que l en alusi n a jaime est manejando de 890 millones de d lares y va a ser mucho mayor todav a por las p rdidas que hoy est teniendo
8158091 jaime lo que ha hecho es ocultar la realidad para tratar de sacar un proyecto que l mismo impuls de generar esta discusi n
8158092 aerol neas tiene que ser salvada y rescatada por el estado pero no a cualquier precio es decir hoy a la situaci n a la que se llega es como consecuencia de las medidas hostiles que desde la secretar a se han hecho contra aerol neas argentinas

8158107 subjects systematically favoured the prosocial option provided their partner was a familiar b visible and c receiving rewards of equal value
8158108 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
8158109 we believe prosocial behaviour is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices
8158110 capuchin monkeys spontaneously share food in both nature and captivity and commonly sit next to each other while eating
8158111 use it or lose it is the first principle of arctic sovereignty

8158114 what many thought was a somewhat silly flag planting incident in canadas arctic
8158115 the situation is quite different hindus are at the receiving end a highly respected saint was killed there is enough evidence to prove the complicity of christian organisations in the murder
8158116 the vhp gets the maximum amount of money india than christians christians have used money to serve and empower the poor and marginalized not a single case has been proved till date in the courts of forced conversion by christian groups
8158117 kandhamal is one of the poorest regions in the country seventy per cent people here are below the poverty line 51 per cent are tribals and 16 per cent are dalits
8158118 every conversion in orissa has to be registered with the local police or magistrate but no such thing happens where is the chance for hindutva politics when missionaries are going about aggressively and alluring people
8158119 an ideology of hatred has been propagated by some sections of the sangh parivar they dont hate christian service it is the very identity of being a christian that is hated there are just 2 4 per cent christians in india and we too have contributed to the growth of the country
8158120 every religion is respected in this country but christians criticise and attack hindu religion it this attitude of christians which is leading to tension in this country
8158121 the shrinking rights of tribals over forests and land and the coming of mega projects is the economic issue there they are all poor there and poverty is being diverted to communalism it is competitive politics
8158122 there is a clear cut division between hindus and christians and it is because of their missionaries wrongdoing and congress leaders a holy person is killed and the very next day the congress tables a no confidence motion against the state government what does it suggest the congress is a part of a larger political conspiracy
8158123 i hope the civil society wakes up before its too late
8158124 do not make this a christian versus hindu issue we must go into the sources of violence

8158159 oftentimes when people get their cat or kitten the breeder or previous owner will say theyve had their first shots but thats probably about it

8158283 we have observed previously that the idea of smoking a cigarette becomes increasingly attractive to smokers while they are craving
8158284 this study suggests that when smokers are not craving they fail to appreciate just how powerful their cravings will be this lack of insight while not craving may lead them to make decisions such as choosing to attend a party where there will be lots of smoking that they may come to regret

8158294 to humans that sounds very short but bats operate on a completely different timescale
8158295 the time from detection of an insect to capture is often less than a second typically when they approach an insect they wait only 20 to 50 milliseconds between sounds so if they go silent for 600 or 800 milliseconds thats a long time for them
8158296 there has been a lot of speculation that they could do this but i think this is possibly the first demonstration that they are listening to other animals calls in addition to their own
8158297 when one bat went silent it was typically trailing another bat so it was in a good position to listen to the echoes and vocalizations produced by the leading bat

8158306 let me categorically deny this we would like to further clarify and reiterate that there has been no realignment of our business strategy in any way we continue to learn from our experience and sharpen our customer offerings our overall retail strategy and joint ventures are completely aligned with what our chairman stated in his agm speech that we will aggressively pursue partnerships wherever appropriate which give us access to world class scale in the supply chain end and best practices on the operations end
8158307 as far as the reliance retail function goes our attrition rates are below at par with industry standards our businesses have achieved scale and new ventures continue to expand in this context some employees in functions are continuously reassigned to group companies on the completion of projects

8158321 with user generated content the agenda being set is coming from the population not the campaign
8158322 there are different groups participating in the political process this time younger people and constituents who are otherwise not from the traditional political establishment
8158323 its something more permanent than a spoken comment and less likely to be misattributed
8158324 the messages that are selling are overwhelmingly positive and thats with mccain too
8158325 we have just as much negative content available but thats not selling
8158326 you have a candidate on the democratic side who not only appeals to folks as a celebrity and is often presented as such on access hollywood and the cover of rolling stone but the fact is that his image sells
8158327 popular culture has always had a bad rap as an industry perceived as forcing things down peoples throats and manufacturing enthusiasm
8158328 but if you believe that obama products could be seen as a form of political brainwashing that model is wrong you cant force people to buy things and wear them just as you cant make people see films that they dont want to see
8158329 when we started we both had full time jobs but we wanted a way to get obamas name out there

8158335 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8158336 nothing to improve the prospects of peace in the caucasus
8158337 i want to remind you that cold war was a completely different beast when we were really at each others throats in a big way internationally and this is not going to happen under any circumstances
8158338 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
8158339 short of losing our dignity as a nation we couldnt act otherwise

8158355 we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt we must make our election between economy and liberty or profusion and servitude if we run into such debt as that we must be taxed in our meat and in our drink in our necessaries and our comforts in our labors and our amusements for our calling and our creeds we will have no time to think no means of calling our miss managers to account but be glad to obtain subsistence by hiring ourselves to rivet their chains on the necks of our fellow sufferers and this is the tendency of all human governments a departure from principle in one instance becomes a precedent for another till the bulk of society is reduced to be mere automatons of misery and the fore horse of this frightful team is public debt taxation follows that and in its train wretchedness and oppression

8158363 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8158364 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8158365 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8158366 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8158367 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election
8158368 this is the story of america of women and men who defy the odds and never give up

8158370 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days they are awfully hard to tell apart

8158374 russia may find itself in a very dangerous isolation if no other state supports abkhazia s and south ossetias independence
8158375 here one must see how russia advanced in building contacts over the past few years for example with the arab world it is not impossible that turkey iran syria or jordan may support russia in this but that is uncertain
8158376 examine from this point of view the consequences of russias decision
8158377 looking at a variety of options with regard to consequences for russias behaviour in georgia its aggression in georgia
8158378 if they want relations to worsen they will get it
8158379 russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the six point agreement

8158390 at a time where so many working people are trying to hold on to their houses keep gas in the tank and pay for college tuition its outrageous that billionaires are gaming the tax system so they not only pay a lower tax rate than the firemen and janitors who are taking care of them but they actually get subsidies to do it
8158391 what are identified as tax loopholes are often in there for legitimate policy reasons its not like businesses and executives have the run of capitol hill and they are sticking in all sorts of unjustified stuff
8158392 suntech has dropped about 19 since last month largely on concerns about solar panel sales in spain
8158393 thats one of suntechs major markets and the spanish government has discussed reducing subsidies in 2009 thats unlikely to happen but the company has the backlog to make up for the loss even if it does

8158408 they went gayly and light heartedly into the task of taking charge of what seems like all the population of the intermountain states and a large share of the east and today they know that they have sat in a mans game denver today is revising its estimates and trying desperately to straighten itself up for what is before it

8158471 both the bank and dvb were cautious in attempting to grow their lending and lease portfolios in the present interest rate regime since the debt servicing capacity of many borrowers especially those in the sme small and medium enterprise sector was strained by the combined effects of high inflation and high borrowing costs
8158472 the ability to more aggressively grow the credit portfolio without seriously impairing quality will be contingent upon inflation and interest rates reducing significantly
8158473 the recent drop in global oil prices if sustained may help to achieve this in the coming months

8158483 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
8158484 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
8158485 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

8158516 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in the eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
8158517 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
8158518 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
8158519 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens

8158522 this study suggests that when smokers are not craving they fail to appreciate just how powerful their cravings will be this lack of insight while not craving may lead them to make decisions such as choosing to attend a party where there will be lots of smoking that they may come to regret
8158523 to humans that sounds very short but bats operate on a completely different timescale
8158524 the time from detection of an insect to capture is often less than a second typically when they approach an insect they wait only 20 to 50 milliseconds between sounds so if they go silent for 600 or 800 milliseconds thats a long time for them
8158525 there has been a lot of speculation that they could do this but i think this is possibly the first demonstration that they are listening to other animals calls in addition to their own
8158526 when one bat went silent it was typically trailing another bat so it was in a good position to listen to the echoes and vocalizations produced by the leading bat
8158527 in the wild they could rely on spatial memory in familiar surroundings and they could also use vision in moonlight that would aid them in locating obstacles
8158528 face further inequity because they have less access to high quality childcare provision

8158530 in three years afghanistan has gone from 82 percent of the provinces growing poppy to approximately 60 percent of the provinces being poppy free
8158531 at this point in time i would like to ask nato and isaf to concentrate on these three very physical targets targets in the hands of either insurgents or criminal groups
8158532 and therefore not attacking the farmers but attacking those who provide the opportunity for farmers to cultivate opium

8158545 we have strict orders from our higher ups to give no quarter to curfew violators and deal with any violations firmly
8158546 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8158547 it is prudent for the governor general to remain in canada
8158548 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
8158549 if we leave before this government resigns that means we are defeated
8158550 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
8158551 we are continuing to collect information through the afghan authorities but his safety has yet to be confirmed
8158552 we will do our best so that mr ito is rescued as soon as possible
8158553 no one ever predicted that clownfish would be attracted to the scent of leaves i just figured they might like beach water
8158554 i saw the islands had heavy vegetation and i said lets give it a shot
8158555 its really easy to speculate that without the leaves clownfish might not be able to find their homes
8158556 off any island therell be eddies and currents that pull leaves out a fair ways from islands

8158559 ive been up and down the road in discussions with my ex wife dina and its to the point now that im going to confront samantha and jenny muro lindsays production assistant myself
8158560 samantha drinks and passes the drinks under the table to lindsay and behind the scenes it gets worse and worse
8158561 sam is using my daughter my daughter isnt working because shes always with sam even my ex wife knows it she just isnt doing anything about it
8158562 kristi kaufman has been called and we have agreed to go through a mutual lab for a paternity test over the next 30 days
8158563 the only advice i can give anyone in his situation is be upfront be honest and we have to try our best never to make the same mistakes again
8158564 we dont understand the purpose of sleep but it must be important because all animals do it
8158565 the very fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot be eliminated
8158566 sleep may be the price you pay so your brain can be plastic the next day
8158567 while there may still be no consensus on why animals need to sleep it would seem that searching for a core function of sleep particularly at the cellular level is still a worthwhile exercise
8158568 tests for perfect pitch have always demanded that subjects already have some musical training or at least familiarity with a particular piece of music which really limits the pool of candidates you can test
8158569 that means nobody really knew how prevalent perfect pitch is in humans in general
8158570 what gyurcsany wants is to go down to the hungarian book of records as the prime minister who held office for the longest time no matter what price hungary has to pay for it
8158571 if someone rides up to a convenience store with a sawed off shotgun and a prior record im not intimidating anybody by calling the cops if this republican campaign is going to be run in mccarthyite fashion by lawbreakers in an illegal way they are going to pay a price
8158572 why would barack obama be friends with somebody who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
8158573 if you cant get excited about voting for mccain these are the kinds of ads that get them excited about voting against obama
8158574 if he thinks his long association with an unrepentant domestic terrorist is nothing the american people should be concerned about hes delusional or naive
8158575 a knowing and willful attempt to evade the strictures of federal election law
8158576 well keep doing it until we find the right way
8158577 i think the whole ballpark knew he wasnt going to swing but he put on a good show
8158578 its frustrating but with this team in this stadium you never know
8158579 i would say some people thought we were going to die the woman sitting in the seat in front of us was whimpering
8158580 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear we really didnt see them during the main situation at all they didnt say anything they werent visible
8158581 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8158582 i was scared i think everyone was scared ive got three kids and my wife on the flight and i just sat there helplessly thinking it might be the end
8158583 i would say the crew didnt know what to do they didnt inform us for about 20 minutes which i think was wrong a little information would have calmed everyone down
8158584 my wifes oxygen bag inflated and so did my sons mine stayed flat all around me people kept tugging and saying its not working properly
8158585 the first thing we do in these situations is take the safety first option we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8158586 they usually inflate when passengers exhale its a trickle of pure oxygen you dont feel a rush of gas all its doing is enriching the low pressure air
8158587 the pilot is having to navigate having to communicate with air traffic control and having to avoid hitting other aeroplanes his priority is to keep the aeroplane safe
8158588 they satisfy every single safety level but it is the minimum
8158589 gustav could regain hurricane strength wednesday or thursday once it clears the southwestern peninsula of haiti
8158590 more significant strengthening is forecast on thursday when it passes between cuba and jamaica
8158591 if gustav is able to thread the needle passing through the yucatan channel into the gulf of mexico it could intensify to category 4 or 5 strength over the warm water in the gulf
8158592 gustav should pass between jamaica and the southeastern coast of cuba

8158599 youd be surprised how easy it is to suck that many calories through a straw without realizing it
8158600 it would be great if we could just get the facts and not scare tactics to mold the reader to the writers left leaning opinions
8158601 so we just do nothing or do we put windmills on the brooklyn bridge and the statue of liberty sure the oil companies will benefit but thats what they are in business to do in the end we will all benefit by going after those resources that belong to us
8158602 we havent decided to do anything other than continue the discussions and over time figure out what is the best thing to put on that property
8158603 we hope the childrens museum will be a major piece of the strategy
8158604 i wouldnt recommend this if i didnt think you would get five or six times the investment in return
8158605 i think we need to look at the plan and start implementing it

8158614 one of the many risks a spectator assumes while attending a baseball game is possible injury from foul balls
8158615 but its still exciting still exhilarating oh i miss the classroom sometimes i still want to put up bulletin boards and get the room set up but seeing all the children come back thats always exciting
8158616 hes my baby and now hes starting school it was the same with all of them i cried on their first days
8158617 for a lot of them its the first time away from their parents and they cling to me i like being able to help kids and i like being a positive role model for them thats the best part of my job
8158618 the new ones just out of college come in and theyre just as nervous as the kids but i tell them to take a deep breath and then i say make it happen thats what were doing here were making it happen
8158619 id say by thursday or friday well have it all running smooth

8158648 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life
8158649 certain writers have a style that can be best likened to body odor irresistible to some obnoxious to many and apparently imperceptible to the writer himself therouxs lack of self awareness his failure to observe the basic hygiene of modesty is compelling in its way how can anyone be this narcissistic you wonder in disbelief in appalled fascination after reading the auto hagiography of the turkmen leader niyazov theroux summarizes it as pages and pages most of it self reverential he could be writing a press release for his own book

8158659 we were considered the queens most prestigious troop but now weve been thrown out
8158660 the way i look at it i might be the free agent the flyers signed this year
8158661 i wasnt a big part of the team last year and i want to be a big part this season
8158662 when i first saw simon back in april he had neck pain dizziness and real bad headaches
8158663 but he also had a tilt to his pelvis and some back pain his symptoms were very similar to whiplash
8158664 he can now track the puck with no problems and his balance is perfect
8158665 it has really helped with my balance and foot quickness
8158666 im in better shape now than before i got hurt
8158667 hes changed his diet and he has set new parameters for himself hes pushing himself to the max
8158668 the first few days of training camp are going to be huge for him
8158669 if derian is healthy he can be a good player for us
8158670 im certainly concerned whether well have him or not there are some serious issues with that knee
8158671 derian went through a lot last season so well see how it goes
8158672 i know derian wants to play i told him repeatedly that we have to be able to rely on him and not have him in and out of the lineup
8158673 right now im getting my visa and as soon as it is ready i will fly to england to sign a contract i wont play in kiev everything has happened very quickly so i couldnt even say goodbye to my team mates
8158674 i could not decide if i wanted to go to england at first first yes then no
8158675 the only thing that stopped me from leaving was my family but now all doubts are behind me and i decided to sign a contract with tottenham and the formalities are practically settled
8158676 there is a concrete sum which tottenham proposed and we have agreed the amount
8158677 if roman will agree a contract then we are ready to let him go
8158678 i would say some people thought we were going to die that is how frightening it was
8158679 the woman sitting in the seats in front of us was whimpering
8158680 there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft
8158681 the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping my highest priority was to get a mask on my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state
8158682 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons
8158683 he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
8158684 from where i was sitting i could see about 20 masks and only a few of them were inflating it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8158685 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
8158686 the first thing we do in these situations is divert to safety
8158687 the crew cant be making passenger pa announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8158688 as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8 000ft where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off

8158696 we have previously banded in fellowship for what we believe is righteous we do so again this time to defend a good man
8158697 the fellowship continues as we stand together and say to the special prosecutor stay the course the fight against graft and corruption has always been a lonely battle this much we have learned in our time together time and true struggle will unmask the mere opportunist and those without conviction we have faith in you
8158698 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8158699 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8158700 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8158701 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8158702 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8158703 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8158704 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8158705 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8158706 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8158707 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8158708 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8158709 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8158710 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8158711 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8158712 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8158713 the presidency has made every man who occupied it no matter how small bigger than he was and no matter how big not big enough for its demands
8158714 if we pull together we can make a world of difference
8158715 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8158716 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8158717 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8158718 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8158719 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8158720 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8158721 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8158722 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8158723 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8158724 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8158725 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8158726 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8158727 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

8158730 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8158731 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8158732 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8158733 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8158734 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8158735 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8158736 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8158737 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8158738 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8158739 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8158740 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8158741 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8158742 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8158743 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8158744 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8158745 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8158746 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8158747 who are open to doing something on the production side
8158748 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8158749 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8158750 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8158751 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8158752 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8158753 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8158754 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8158755 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8158756 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8158757 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8158758 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8158759 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8158760 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8158761 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8158762 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8158763 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8158764 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8158765 my uncle bought this for me and i am trying to install this the problem is i have zero knowledge in installing a satellite dish i have been reading websites and forums trying their instructions as much as i can and still with no progress not even a blurry or mosaic picture

8158800 at 27 and injury free he has the necessary backing and the big stage on which to do great things to live up to the potential the whole of italy saw in him on his arrival six years ago the question is whether he will make the leap to consistency that true greatness demands or whether he will remain for the rest of his career in the ranks of the only fleetingly brilliant almost greats will he become a regular challenger for european footballer of the year the way zinedine zidane thierry henry lu s figo beckham and ronaldo have or will he remain like david ginola the perfect example of a player who had all the attributes but lacked the mental edge to make it really big
8158801 ruud van nistelrooy is the perfect example of a player who is the precise opposite of these almost greats ra l another neither has the technical ability of recoba cole or mostovoi neither is a brilliant trickster on the ball but they have the heads of champions they are clever they battle and they have the discipline and dedication to maximise what skills they have

8158846 i have painted the figures black to show the era that they belonged to while i have used bright coloured pattern for the background to make it attractive at the same time it conveys that these personalities have made our world a better place to live in

8158849 jika asumsi bi rate sesuai dengan yang ditetapkan pemerintah tentu pasar obligasi akan kembali ramai tahun depan
8158850 tapi kalau bi rate kembali di posisi 8 5 saya rasa akan banyak emiten yang melanjutkan rencana penerbitan obligasi
8158851 bi rate kalau bisa jangan sampai lebih dari 9 karena pasar obligasi bisa terpengaruh signifikan level 9 saja sudah cukup berpengaruh meski seminggu belakangan ini transaksi sudah mulai membaik
8158852 kalau bi rate terlalu tinggi dampaknya kan akan sampai ke sektor riil yang bisa menambah tingkat inflasi kalau demikian pasar obligasi bisa menurun drastis
8158853 menurut perhitungan kami pasar obligasi domestik akan sehat jika terdapat spread sekitar 300 basis poin antara suku bunga obligasi lokal dengan obligasi dollar biasanya spread 300 poin mendorong investor masuk ke pasar obligasi kita

8158857 life without music is like having your lover but without love in the relationship
8158858 music soothes the life inside each of us and expresses our feelings everyday my life is a continuous melody of love songs that i share with all of gods creatures
8158859 life without music is simply living without any story to tell
8158860 music is soul food to go music brings solace to ones soul
8158861 i grew up with music around me my dad was a musician and i suppose i inherited his musical genes music has always been my passion and i just cant imagine life without it
8158862 i would celebrate music because its really a large part of being human of humanity we people celebrate occasions like birth marriage national days of independence holy days and even sexual orientation i celebrate music everyday in my profession
8158863 i am thrilled anxious privileged humbled to be working with greats like karen jules mikey leander marvin and of course to have mon torralba for my musical director i have done shows separately with these guys but this is the first time they are collaborating with me in my own show and i can only promise that with talents as immense and as celebrated as them autumn will be a most welcome season when we celebrate music together
8158864 is to celebrate the gift of music we are not celebrating with music but we are actually celebrating music for what it is

8158902 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8158903 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8158904 i think it could well be said that nothing has so become her campaign as the way she has ended it here tonight
8158905 sen clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment
8158906 nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8158907 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8158908 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8158909 there is not a liberal america and a conservative america there is the united states of america there is not a black america and a white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america
8158910 its a very powerful speech hes going to come out of this convention the way barack obama came out of the last convention as the rock star as the next guy
8158911 it was an important speech because if this election is about experience and strength mccain wins but if this elections about the past versus the future republicans have a much tougher job
8158912 is a fight for the future and a fight we must win together
8158913 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8158914 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8158915 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8158916 we dont need four more years of the last eight years more economic stagnation more war and less diplomacy
8158917 to my supporters to my champions to my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits from the bottom of my heart thank you

8158923 this is an appropriate time to use these rainy day funds given the unprecedented financial storm pounding metro today
8158924 buying a car isnt really an option especially with the price of fuel these days
8158925 we can have a discussion about how much and how quickly
8158926 what no one wants is being put in a situation where were forced a couple of years from now to make drastic service cuts
8158927 that is unacceptable especially now that transit is more in demand than ever
8158928 im certain we cant have a real solution until we engage the governor and the legislature
8158929 i feel very uncomfortable with their past but neither of them is thought of as horrible types now so far as most of us know they are legitimate members of the community
8158930 you have mixed news here mirroring the mixed news in the economy last year
8158931 but i think it is quite reasonable to say 2007 was a peak year and still median income is slightly below the 2000 level poverty is higher and child poverty is way up you have a cycle here that was very sluggish
8158932 if we continue to turn a blind eye to the growing income gap between the very rich and the rest of us well find ourselves in a country with no middle class
8158933 bridging our countrys troubling income gap starts with universal health care because working families will never get ahead if they continue to be held back by medical bills and insurance premiums they cant afford to pay
8158934 programs like schip and medicaid are lifelines for providing americans with the health care they need especially during times when the economy is soft and more people feel vulnerable to losing employer sponsored health insurance
8158935 unfortunately were still seeing an unraveling of the private insurance system

8159002 bull which i loved writing was researched for about a year
8159003 other stories get kicked around for a few weeks before we go into the writers room to organize ideas on the white boards that takes about a week then another week to ten days to write the script followed by a week of rewriting episodes are shot in 9 weekdays occasionally less and occasionally on weekends as well about 6 to 8 weeks later the episode is ready for airing
8159004 in the us these diseases are defined as those which affect less than 2 00 000 patients or those for which cost of development is unlikely to be covered through commercialisation orphan drugs are thus used for rare diseases for which there is an unmet medical need
8159005 there is limited commercial opportunity for such drugs however research based pharma companies are able to apply their r amp d expertise in partnership with government and other medical institutes for orphan indications with unmet medical needs
8159006 considering that there are next to none pharma companies in india manufacturing or researching orphan drugs to my knowledge there will be no incentives for them however in 2001 a group of pharmacologists at an indian drug manufacturing association idma conference had appealed to the indian government to form something akin to the orphan drug act but i have not heard of any kind of development in this context since then
8159007 but we do have national institutes that specifically are focused on research and development on illnesses with high prevalence in india such as malaria tuberculosis leishmaniasis etc
8159008 orphan drugs though may be approved through fast track mechanisms are still subjected to clinical research testing to understand overall risk benefit about the product orphan drugs are not approved until the regulatory agency is not satisfied of the positive risk benefit for an orphan indication
8159009 the only flaw in the orphan drug act is that they should have some regulation for price control of orphan drugs so that the affordability and accessibility improves but that should not clash with the interests of the pharma companies to invest in the segment there should be a mechanism which brings competition in the segment for established players
8159010 genzyme had changed its production process and replaced ceredase which is made from human placental tissues with cerezyme which is developed through recombinant dna technology which meant that the investment in the manufacturing process had come down but the prices still stayed high
8159011 what generally happens is that when the market exclusivity period is on after some years the rare disease situation is checked by the authorities and if the market exclusivity given is justified then it may be extended to about 10 years or more
8159012 orphan drugs though may be approved through fast track mechanisms are still subjected to clinical research testing to understand overall risk benefit about the product orphan drugs are not approved until the regulatory agency is not satisfied of the positive risk benefit for an orphan indication
8159013 firstly when you talk about the clinical trials of orphan drugs you have to understand that the number of people available for these clinical trials is very less considering that the research is for rare diseases hence it takes less time for companies to wrap up with the trials
8159014 these regulations are just present ideally however there may be companies taking advantage of them
8159015 before the orphan drug act came in the picture in 1983 there was no proof at all of such a market segment in the pharma industry so the industry only picked up after the legislation was formed
8159016 people used to think that whatever orphan drug research was happening worldwide was being done by biotech companies which was true initially but now if you see the number of orphan drugs that have received orphan drug designation from the us fda they belong to the top five pharma companies ie johnson amp johnson novartis glaxosmithkline bayer and pfizer one would expect players like amgen biogen genentech genzyme etc to be on the top
8159017 what has happened here is that the big pharma companies have taken over the respective biotech companies and acquired their orphan drugs because during that time a lot of mergers and acquisitions were happening and finally j amp j got a lot of bulk drugs and biotech companies which is why it has the most orphan drug designations amongst the pharma companies
8159018 it is tougher for biogeneric companies to manufacture these drugs because they have to conduct clinical studies in order to prove that their product is a biosimilar with similar effects and is devoid of harmful effects pharma companies do not invest as much on a drug as biotech companies do otherwise with so much investment involved the biosimilar companies will rather make monoclonal antibodies related to cardio cancer or diabetes
8159019 you develop a drug and then you expand the indication with r amp d and block within the disease various indications so that it cuts your competition for the market exclusivity period and beyond
8159020 companies already have done the toxicology studies the only thing left to do is clinical studies hence the development process does not take as much time as it took the first time for a different indication they just have to expand and keep on blocking and there will be minimum loopholes for competitive companies to find
8159021 the future of the orphan drug industry will depend heavily upon the entry of biogenerics the biopharma market is highly attractive to generic companies and legislation permitting biogenerics will come sooner rather than later such legislation will have a tremendous impact on the orphan drug market with reduced profitability attracting investment in areas with low economic return will become a challenge
8159022 the only flaw in the orphan drug act is that they should have some regulation for price control of orphan drugs so that the affordability and accessibility improves but that should not clash with the interests of the pharma companies to invest in the segment there should be a mechanism which brings competition in the segment for established players

8159081 the governor remains committed that he is not going to sign any bills until we have a budget
8159082 however these four measures need to get on the november ballot
8159083 its time for the governor to stop sending letters and holding press conferences

8159096 its about pausing to experience the flavors and appreciate the effort that the farmer has made to grow the food and how it was prepared
8159097 its definitely about eating seasonally but also cooking from scratch rather than packages
8159098 here in sacramento we are very blessed to have so many farmers markets where we can meet the farmers learn where the food was grown or produced its important to preserve and support that resource

8159106 we had a bad game at fulham and credit to them because they played very well
8159107 no matter how good you are in life players are human beings and have been away for the whole of last week
8159108 when you have an away game it can happen that you are caught for 20 or 30 minutes
8159109 but i know my squad is good my team is good our spirit is good we are intelligent enough to know we did not play well but we know as well we have the needed quality to respond
8159110 your desire is to play well and win no matter how much experience you have if you dont play well you have more chances to lose than to win
8159111 our defensive line they work together as one its not really individuals everyone works together
8159112 like me and dere hicks were together as one but as a group i would give it to the defensive line they put the defense on their back and make plays
8159113 i feel its kind of a cliche in the game of football you win the game up front on both offense and on defense
8159114 whoever wins that battle usually is going to have a very good chance of winning the game we feel we have a strong defensive line and a very strong offensive line
8159115 i certainly like to think that we have a lot to do with it
8159116 juice has done a tremendous job maturing going from his freshman year to his sophomore year he got better too
8159117 i think that hoomanawanuis put himself in a position to have a big year
8159118 he had a really good spring and we were pretty pumped up about that im looking forward to the tight end playing a bigger position for us
8159119 sometimes youre not as confident with a position right off the top
8159120 but as time goes on you begin to gain that confidence and i think coach locksley has gained the confidence in his tight ends to go out there and make plays and stretch the field a little bit
8159121 theres a lot of things to learn about the game that you didnt know as a younger player
8159122 but being an upperclassman and playing my first two years here personally ive taken on a leadership standpoint with the two tight ends that just came in
8159123 we put the bodies in the main mosque he told the associated press by phone sometimes pausing to collect himself as he wept
8159124 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
8159125 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
8159126 nothing less than the fate of our nation hangs in the balance
8159127 i am so honored to be here tonight i am here tonight as a proud mother as a proud democrat as a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8159128 my friends it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8159129 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8159130 this is a fight for the future and it is a fight we must win together i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights here at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander our promise no way no how no mccain
8159131 tonight i ask you to remember what a presidential election is really about
8159132 when the polls are closed and when the ads are off the air it comes down to your lives and your childrens future
8159133 you taught me so much and you made me laugh and yes you even made me cry you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8159134 most of all i ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight years
8159135 those are the reasons i ran for president and those are the reasons i support barack obama for president
8159136 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8159137 or were you in it for that young marine were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8159138 it makes perfect sense that john mccain and george w bush will be together in the twin cities in minnesota for the republican convention because these days they are awful hard to tell apart

8159141 the bottom line is that i never questioned their faith
8159142 that science has to be testable and proven with evidence
8159143 my whole curriculum was based on evolution i integrated it into everything i taught
8159144 now this muddies the waters and keeps students from having a really good education
8159145 when they go to college they will be at a disadvantage because they will not have a good understanding of science
8159146 the phrase academic freedom has been used by creationists for decades

8159152 it was a tougher camp way tougher than last year and it was a better camp than last year

8159158 we will be airing a number of classic games involving the illini illinois football the journey is going to be an all access behind the scenes show
8159159 the big attraction for illinois football is whether or not illinois football will be able to do it again
8159160 a lot of people outside of the illinois program were surprised at the success they had at that level we look for the most intriguing story lines we can find
8159161 big ten network is kind of like espn for us
8159162 now you have the opportunity to see every game no matter where theyre playing
8159163 we have reason to believe that the suspects could be the same person
8159164 survivors prepare themselves both mentally and emotionally to do what it takes it might involve life threatening risk you may do something you never thought you were capable of doing
8159165 there are two extremes on the one hand is paranoia and on the other is oblivion
8159166 were just trying to get people to keep this on their radar
8159167 if you have the towel in your hand youre helping our football student athletes win and defend their home turf it will be raising the stature of illinois and our community all of those things all play into everybody being a part of the same team
8159168 i like that they have the charitable side in it
8159169 if we can do something every year to make illinois a little more unique i think thatd be good
8159170 the law recognizes a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the reported racist rantings of a drug addict
8159171 a bunch of meth heads get together we dont know why they do what they do people do lots of stupid things on meth
8159172 if youre talking about a true threat there has to be some evidence theyre not just talking about it or thinking about it especially in a drug induced state
8159173 it was a lot of hard work we put a lot into this weve been together for a month now 28 days away from my kids i cant wait to get back to see them we put a lot of work and effort into it and it all paid off it feels great for us to be the only anthem being played we represented our country the right way
8159174 i dont have an nba championship i dont have a college championship but even if i did id still think the same
8159175 this is for your country its not for your team its for your whole country for a whole nation of people back home supporting us for our troops overseas fighting for us this is for everybody
8159176 we knew we were headed in the right direction but you want to see change overnight
8159177 were pretty confident that were on the right track and that our test scores will keep going up
8159178 by building relationships with the kids we really learn what their needs are
8159179 if youre ever in a place where bombs are exploding around you get down
8159180 the shrapnel shoots up and will hit you if youre standing or running
8159181 terrell made it through the night and is getting ready to leave for yerevan
8159182 since beginning the leave we have had no communication with sheriff dorion whatsoever
8159183 it has been 25 days since the leave expired and to the best of our knowledge sheriff dorion has not been in the county not been in the office not doing the duties for which he is required
8159184 im pretty sure im going to be in the backfield getting handoffs any way to get the ball in my hands rashard is a loss for us but were going to fill this hole
8159185 i got angry sometimes because i had to catch some balls with my chest that i know i could have caught with my hands
8159186 now im not going to be timid to do certain things im just going to go out there and do it
8159187 do everything in his power to be the best he can be
8159188 i think anytime youve got a guy who comes up and tells you im going to return punts or im going to return kickoffs i just kind of smile i mean thats what you want you want a guy who wants the ball in his hands
8159189 last year we may have been labeled as a running team but juice has gotten better with his passing hes more of a quarterback
8159190 its definitely something that i didnt expect to have coming back from the olympics this time
8159191 there have been so many mens olympic teams that have gone and not brought back any medals
8159192 it just started with one article someone was just ripping into us like well the chinese mens team are just going to dominate everything and then there was a small blurb at the bottom about a paragraph long pretty much just saying dont expect anything from the u
8159193 the popular thought was that this team wasnt even going to be in finals not even in finals means were not even in the top eight and everyone on the team was just like no chance it was just unreal they got us pissed
8159194 this is the same team that went and got fourth in last years world championships without paul and morgan and were a stronger team this year
8159195 why all the sudden arent we going to make top eight the team never doubted itself we never freaked out
8159196 i think the significance of what they did was amazing we were not able to identify any time from any country when a team didnt have at least one former olympian
8159197 i think this is a group of guys that always believed in themselves that they were all one team and that they were all ready to go and that no matter who was on the floor that they were going to be successful
8159198 its probably one of the hardest sports in the world its awesome nbc switched over to the coverage the more people that watch it the better
8159199 justins an enthusiastic guy a very outgoing guy and he carries that exuberance onto the floor and to the team
8159200 he keeps everyone fired up about the competition hes like a cheerleader on the floor
8159201 the guys never counted themselves out although there was tremendous pressure without having paul or morgan out there they had to put it all on the line
8159202 i think justin and jonathan horton really showed their leadership those two guys really showed up
8159203 that was maybe the highlight of the olympic games for me
8159204 thats the moment i spent my life dreaming about having it be on the line for the team i just lost it it was awesome
8159205 we knew pommel horse was our weakest event we struggle to get through mediocre routines
8159206 i trusted sasha but i was definitely a little nervous but he didnt fall off that horse and thats all we needed
8159207 the chinese national anthem was playing but our flag was right there and being raised in the arena it was just a sense of pride for your team your country you represented all those things you hold dear and did it well so it was really cool
8159208 i think im just going to put it in my trophy case and have it kind of out because its more sentimental i dont think anyone would steal it
8159209 there is absolutely nothing to link hari puttar with harry potter
8159210 even if it does rhyme with harry potter surely there is a limit to cases
8159211 my name is orlando castaneda and i am a combat veteran
8159212 i believe its my responsibility to make sure other soldiers are ok soldiers do need a lot of help

8159215 the barn acoustically is quite live with the wood ceiling
8159216 i saw my neighbor flying a plane when i was 13 went over and watched him and i was done
8159217 six hours a day four to five times a week you have to approach it one piece at a time
8159218 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8159219 proud supporter of barack obama she dismissed republican john mccain with a few choice words
8159220 we dont need four more years of the last eight years

8159222 you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8159223 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me

8159232 but we understand its very difficult for new viewers to get involved
8159233 there is a core group of people where lg15 literally is their social network somewhere in the range of 10 000 people every day
8159234 but probably 100 000 people once every week or two weeks would binge and check out all the content then
8159235 take such and such pill and dont change anything else in your diet and lose 20lbs in 2 weeks
8159236 memang ada dua versi supriyadi yang satu supriyadi dari jawa timur dan andaryoko dari jawa tengah yang mengaku sebagai supriyadi
8159237 satunya lagi supriyadi yang kini bernama andaryoko berasal dari jawa tengah ya memang beda supriyadi nya dan berasal dari keluarga yang berbeda pula
8159238 itu kemudian saya tulis dengan berbagai catatan ini adalah bentuk tulisan sejarah lisan bukan mononarasi tapi multinarasi
8159239 ini dna siapa dengan siapa jelas keduanya berbeda dan tidak ada hubunganya supriyadi dengan nama andaryoko dari semarang jawa tengah dan supriyadi dari blitar itu jelas tidak ada hubungan apa apa andaryoko itu orang lain lagi
8159240 ya allah berilah aku cinta mu cintanya orang yang mencintai mu dan cintanya orang yang mendekatkanku pada cinta mu jadikan cinta kepada mu lebih aku cintai daripada air yang sejuk
8159241 setiap manusia normal mampu mengingat 1 000 000 000 000 10 11 bit informasi
8159242 cintailah semua yang ada di bumi engkau akan dicintai oleh yang ada di langit
8159243 tidaklah beriman seseorang di antara kamu sehingga ia mencintai saudaranya sebagaimana ia mencintai dirinya sendiri
8159244 cinta adalah agamaku kemana pun binatang penunggangnya menuju di sanalah agama ditambatkan
8159245 ragukan bahwa bintang bintang itu api ragukan bahwa matahari itu bergerak ragukan bahwa kebenaran itu dusta tapi jangan ragukan makna sebuah cinta
8159246 maka bila aku telah mencintainya akulah telinga yang ia gunakan untuk mendengar mata yang ia gunakan untuk melihat lidah yang ia gunakan untuk berbicara tangan yang memberi kekutan padanya dan akulah kaki yang ia gunakan untuk berjalan bila berdoa pada ku aku kabulkan permohonannya bila meminta dari ku aku kabulkan permintaannya aku tidak pernah bimbang dalam menentukan sesuatu seperti kebimbangan ku saat kematian mukmin yang menghindar darinya sedang aku membenci hal itu
8159247 aku diutus tidak lain kecuali untuk mereformasi budi pekerti manusia
8159248 aku tidak mengutus engkau muhammad kecuali sebagai penebar cinta kasih kepada seru sekalian alam
8159249 despite the searches made by myself and friends we have still been unable to locate snakey
8159250 we have been advised that there have been two suspected sightings of snakey during the last week and on both occasions medway police have attended thoroughly searched the area and provided support to the people who have voiced their concerns over the safety of themselves their family and their pets
8159251 i would therefore like to take the opportunity to express my warmest gratitude and praise to medway police
8159252 other police forces should follow the amazing standard they have set
8159253 keep windows and doors closed and small animals in the house if possible
8159254 we have been advised that six foot is not large for a boa constrictor however do not touch it or attempt to pick it up by the tail as these snakes do bite
8159255 they are also excellent swimmers if you see the snake or have suspicions as to where it may be call 999
8159256 oh great now were all going to dress the same
8159257 rogge has basically conspired against the sports to get them removed
8159258 i feel one person the president of the ioc a person from europe has taken it upon himself to ruin the lives of millions actually billions of women
8159259 you cant shut down major league baseball you just cant do it and nobody can reasonably expect us to
8159260 baseball will go on just fine its never depended in any way shape or form even slightly on the olympics
8159261 do we really need the natures peace and quiet in these times
8159262 rising fuel prices and general economic concerns are making people think carefully about how they drive
8159263 the upshot of less traffic is a drop in congestion levels meaning motorists can get from a to b quicker while travelling at lower and more economical speeds
8159264 qs big attraction is that it works on any platform with floating point support and it lends itself to any game genre
8159265 this is an important step for us not only are we taking our game development onto pcs and consoles but were also expanding our testing services
8159266 we looked at the options and concluded that q is the only engine offering a future proof solution that works rights across every single pipeline in a big studio good developers are always at a premium with q we can deploy their skills on any project at any time
8159267 it makes our workforce highly flexible and that allows us to deliver on time while maintaining high standards and keeping costs down
8159268 gamesindustry biz is essential reading i read it daily as my main online source of information about the european games market operating in a fast changing global business i have to have up to date reliable information gamesindustry biz is a great resource the team are highly professional and well regarded
8159269 first our money the pound or the euro is very strong and because of that the turnover from those countries is heavier than they used to be
8159270 so for ubisoft turnover europe is actually more important than the us now and by more than 5 per cent its become a very strong market for us
8159271 i think there are lots of customers that want to play because in europe we love to play the only problem we had was that the games were becoming more and more difficult to play now that theres more accessibility some accessories that are helping people to have fun i think this market has no limit in the growth it can have if we can make sure that the people that are coming in are staying
8159272 a game like endwar for example which you can control by voice its totally changing the industry because it gives you the opportunity to command whats happening and to have a quick answer to the orders you give
8159273 and its the same for a lot of other games like the party games you can play the games with guitars are also helping things to increase the fun and bring more people because when you have fun with your family on the game you take them into more games with you
8159274 it plays totally in that plan and on top i think we will be able to give a better experience as well
8159275 because you play a game but you want to know more about the story the character so you will read the book but you will also want to have a more linear experience where you can learn about the enemy the cities where things are happening and so on
8159276 gamesindustry biz is one of my starting tabs when i boot up so its always one of the first sites i see each day its good being able to catch up with whats happened in the us overnight and in the uk before im awake first thing and know that the stories will be accurate and thought out
8159277 the asia pacific region is on the minds of a lot of people in the industry right now and its going to be particularly exciting to see how the business there will evolve
8159278 games convention asia is a great event to watch that transition first hand and get to know the people at the forefront of it
8159279 gamesindustry biz is a truly international player and its readers are interested in the global games industry
8159280 by partnering with them and introducing our audience to the gamesindustry biz network we will be able to share the opportunities were seeing in the asia pacific region with the rest of the world
8159281 its a tossup whether i check gamesindustry biz or make my morning coffee first as both are essential to my early morning routine i find gamesindustry biz a key component of my research with the sites editors and reporters breaking news stories more often than any of its competitors
8159282 vi kommer til at bne marginalt lavere usa har ikke rigtig kunne f lge stigningen op efter n gletallene og jeg tror at man havde sat n sen op efter mere

8159303 drums that seem to breathe as they cartwheel forward with unpredictable fluctuations
8159304 theres a moth flock in my gut growing a tug at my groin like tides trying to pull moon towards them i cant ignore them and when we say your name our tongues catch flame and you wonder why we aint got nothing to say
8159305 going surfing is a big part of my creative process
8159306 surfing has always been a big part of my life ive surfed since i was nine years old leaving land is my favorite part of it i like being in a separate reality
8159307 its still my favorite thing to listen to a story through a song its like nothing else a song can preserve time and memory and history in a way that words or a picture alone cant a song can capture it all
8159308 it was a great time and a life changing time for me i felt like i had a peer group not only did i identify as far as politics and music but also age wise i had been with people because they were lesbian and women and we had a lot in common but they were all a lot older so for once i fit in where could a freak fit in in punk rock
8159309 so i came back from san francisco and the only people i knew here were lesbians and no way man i wanted punk rock i started going out to punk shows i would put on a little suit and tie and i would go there and try to look so cool though i didnt know a soul
8159310 he walks up to me and says hey want to be in a band
8159311 the fashions changed and the politics changed and people were wearing the swastika which they hadnt been up to that time because im jewish i would notice and it pissed me off so i wrote a song called take off your swastika it was right around the same time the dead kennedys wrote nazi punks fuck off i wrote the song as a direct personal reaction to the swastikas and i decided to play it on my acoustic guitar up til then id been playing electric guitar and synthesizer nobody in punk was really playing acoustic guitar at that time and the reason i did it was because i really wanted the words to be heard because as far as im concerned punk rock is the folk music of today though i didnt play it at some folk club i played it at punk rock clubs
8159312 people would yell and id get heckled and stuff but on the whole it was pretty great i remember playing at the whisky and seeing a couple of guys taking off their swastikas

8159346 but i cant picture us still being beatles when were 30 years old
8159347 when we opened in 69 the average age of our clients was 23 today its probably around 27 and thats taking a lot of people whove been listing their age as 25 for the last six or seven years at their word
8159348 ive never thought that much about age i mean ive always really liked chuck berry and he must be closing in on 50 by now
8159349 i dont think anybody would get real upset if they found out ill be 30 in a couple of weeks but why take a chance
8159350 shell kill me if you print this but our drummer is
8159351 did you see dave edmunds and rockpile at the roxy a couple of months ago or carl perkins at the whisky i didnt hear anybody calling them too old did you you could put four 59 year old men together and if they rocked like that nobody would call them old
8159352 throughout history men have been reaching their peaks at around 33 look at mozart and alexander the great and jesus if only people under 30 were allowed to play it it would be rocks loss
8159353 a couple of times when i was broke i had to join groups that were more like 9 to 5 punch in punch out jobs than music
8159354 but everybody kept asking me why i wasnt playing until i realized that i wasnt being true to my school as the beach boys would say that playing the guitar is what im really around to do
8159355 this is the last group ill ever be in full time if we dont get signed im going to find myself a nice well paying probably deathly boring job and live comfortably again ive done enough starving

8159420 pretty much from the get go i didnt have my good stuff
8159421 i couldnt get ahead my curveball and changeup werent really there overall not a very good night
8159422 right when i got out there i knew something wasnt right
8159423 i was struggling to get ahead it was just brutal
8159424 but even when he doesnt have his best stuff hes got quality stuff to get you out we did a good job of waiting him out and getting balls that were up in the zone
8159425 that was a very good inning against a guy who looks like hes on his way to the cy young
8159426 with brandon you have to be patient because he sinks the ball and tries to get you to chase his off speed stuff
8159427 i knew what to do to fix the problem but i couldnt do it
8159428 we cant for the life of us work out why they do it
8159429 were doing systematic observations now to determine if theres something that may trigger it but so far we havent found anything
8159430 this indicates that they do learn from each other which is not a surprise really but it does also seem that they exhibit elements of what in humans we would call cultural behaviour
8159431 these are things that groups develop and are passed between individuals and that come to define those groups such as language or dancing and it would seem that among the port river dolphins we may have an incipient tail walking culture
8159432 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8159433 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8159434 it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed and to recent russian statements
8159435 it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories
8159436 regrettable and we reaffirm our attachment to georgias territorial integrity
8159437 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8159438 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8159439 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8159440 i could have voted from my home she is our captain and we dont want to see her disrespected
8159441 who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
8159442 you never know which part of the internet youll need the do you need sun cream part the whats the quickest way to the airport part the what about an ocean view room part or the can you really afford this part which is why all parts of the internet are on the iphone
8159443 we noted apples argument that the ad was about site availability rather than technical detail but considered the claims youll never know which part of the internet youll need and all parts of the internet are on the iphone implied users could access all websites and see them in their entirety
8159444 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website
8159445 we concluded the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8159446 una costa trei dolari insa daca iei doua iti fac reducere de un dolar
8159447 am vandut vreo 150 incepand de duminica de cand am venit aici
8159448 am avut si magneti de lipit pe frigider la trei dolari insa i am vandut pe toti
8159449 avem si un site de unde puteti cumpara orice va place
8159450 our goal is to realize this facility not to talk about it but to realize it
8159451 i write books the way a glacier would write books
8159452 i hold auditions for characters and a character or two will show up then ill take a character and put him or her into a situation an opening gambit ill put him or her in a little boat and shove them into the current and ill just follow it
8159453 it is a literal trip a literal journey i go very very slowly because to work that way you have to go very slowly and you have to stay extremely focused the challenge and the thrill of it is to take those disparate themes which have no connection to one another and to take the characters which have no connection to one another either and make them come together in such a seamless way that the reader would believe that the whole thing part and parcel was in my head when i began
8159454 one of the things i try to do in my work is to somehow marry the terrible truths of life on this planet with a sense of wonder
8159455 i dont think im that different than kafka in my outlook my world view its just that kafka let it make him miserable and i refuse life is too short for that id like to think theres an afterlife but i certainly have no empirical evidence so im operating as if this is my only shot at it thats why i insist on joy in spite of everything
8159456 small towns in the rural south tend to get pretty drowsy in the summer and then one day these trucks would pull into a dusty vacant field
8159457 by nighttime there would be tents up and colored lights everywhere elephants would be walking about and there would be music too
8159458 not only did that enliven my childhood summers it instilled that notion of transformation that something thats dull and dreary could overnight be transformed into an area of enchantment it has shaped my psyche to a certain extent and my literary approach
8159459 theres no other place that would help me out and do this for me
8159460 they were able to furnish the dental lab for us the community foundation made that happen
8159461 the nicest part of this job is none of it is for us
8159462 at one point i was a highly paid gopher because thats what it took
8159463 we hit the ground running and running very fast we were busy
8159464 im extremely grateful for the foundation and im extremely grateful that they are looking at the whole valley
8159465 theyre so open to funding an agency like ours that serves the immigrant population
8159466 the money has really helped us to educate people about topics we think are important in their lives but which they have no information about
8159467 the reality is this isnt the first time and it wont be the last time the stock market hiccups
8159468 i want the citizens of yakima to feel this is an asset that can be utilized to benefit the whole community and not necessarily just a small part of it i think this foundation has really come to fruition
8159469 i feel this is the most important thing ill ever do
8159470 this is a calling for me i cant think of anything else id rather be doing
8159471 by default people dont think of taking care of their wills their estates the way they should they should think of the yakima valley
8159472 vom face apel la guvern pentru a ne asigura ca aceste lectii vor fi introduse in programa scolilor primare si secundare deoarece reprezinta o baza personala si educationala in formarea curriculum ului national
8159473 they see high schoolers and they want to act like high schoolers
8159474 theyre not mature enough to be mixed with the older kids
8159475 we dont want his facility wiped out which is what would happen it would be gone
8159476 i didnt see moving forward without talking to the medi center owner i hope to keep the medi center where its at
8159477 our hope is that the city will be helpful and look at alternatives that dont require the total elimination of the facility
8159478 its so hard to say anything definitive about scores that go up and down from one year to the next
8159479 there are many more decreases than i would like to see
8159480 please know that whatever the test scores say we know youre working hard
8159481 people said hold it we dont want our infrastructure owned by foreigners
8159482 theres a huge opportunity that the u s public sector is in danger of losing
8159483 it thinks there is a boatload of capital and when it is politically convenient it will be able to take advantage of it but the capital is going into infrastructure assets available today around the world and not waiting for projects in the u s the public sector may sponsor in the future
8159484 och dagen kom n r det var farligare att f rbli i knopp n att sl ut i blom
8159485 residents were able to confirm the number of casualties including names age and gender of the victims
8159486 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some seven to eight houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
8159487 i dont have any information that would suggest that our military commanders in afghanistan dont believe still that this was a legitimate strike on a taliban target

8159489 what is still coming forth is responsibility for their removal
8159490 im here tonight as a proud mother as a proud democrat as a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8159491 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8159492 my champions my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits you never gave in you never gave up and together we made history
8159493 i am still looking for the obama experience thursday night
8159494 did it bring closure no we need to save some tears for tomorrow
8159495 an america defined by deep and meaningful equality from civil rights to labor rights from womens rights to gay rights
8159496 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election i thought she was outstanding
8159497 meet the global challenges of our time democrats know how to do this
8159498 as i recall president clinton and the democrats did it before and president obama and the democrats will do it again
8159499 so che sei il responsabile di greenpeace a modena volevo sentire anche la tua opinione tu cosa ne pensi
8159500 a symbolic transposition which subjects things to the childs activity without rules or limitations
8159501 the capacity for consciousness of self and others arises from developing representational and perceptual activities especially during play
8159502 an individuals ability to deal with the world based on how they mentally process their experiences
8159503 ho mangiato tutto era buonissimo guarda che pancia grossa che ho
8159504 ha habido incremento en relaci n al a o anterior y esto no quiere decir que estemos fallando sino quiere decir porque nosotros estamos haciendo las acciones y es donde y seguiremos intensificando nuestras acciones como es la l nea 01 880 2900024 porque tambi n hay que ver el otro lado es decir los casos que hemos evitado sic
8159505 nosotros estamos capacitando a nuestros m dicos generales para que en determinado momento identifiquen la ideaci n suicida o la depresi n severa que es un s ndrome que acompa a a la persona que decide autolesionarse en un porcentaje que puede llegar hasta el 40 por ciento
8159506 en esta administraci n se han hecho acciones que nunca se hab an implementado en guanajuato y a n as se ha incrementado
8159507 tenemos que seguir trabajando sociedad y gobierno y los medios de comunicaci n con medidas preventivas para que todos vayamos alineados promocionando las medidas de prevenci n
8159508 est n solas y ese es un factor que se da en el mundo entero y aqu en guanajuato
8159509 las mujeres son las que llaman m s hasta un 65 por ciento
8159510 el 80 por ciento de las lesiones autoinfligidas de los suicidas son en hombres porque hay una concepci n de valor que no es la adecuada para autolesionarse que es la consecuencia de cuando ya estuvimos en una situaci n extrema de sufrimiento espiritual y no encontramos otra salida m s que lesionarnos y quitarnos la vida
8159511 se han evitado alrededor de 400 casos e incluso el 22 por ciento de las personas que requieren apoyo se les est dando seguimiento
8159512 for a long time choice between you and kids funny now i cant stand them
8159513 i never got to see you as much as i wanted
8159514 se lamat berjuang lum tetep semangat truz ya optimis semoga lancar dan sukses disana ati ati lum
8159515 papa kenapa papa nggak nulis nama dulu sebelum main itu kan aturannya
8159516 ya iya itu kan peraturannya biarpun papa yang bikin peraturan tetap harus mematuhinya
8159517 o est la diff rence dans votre fa on de gouverner o est le renouveau tant pr n vous n tes que la copie conforme de vos pr d c ceurs
8159518 it would be even better if we could setup terminator with devilspie i will have to find out and get back to you on that
8159519 dari fakta itu kita melihat ada permusuhan dan kekerasan yang dimunculkan dari tempat tempat ibadah karenanya saya mengapresiasi kegiatan kunjungan ke rumah rumah ibadah yang digelar icrp dan cws ini bisa berjalan dengan sangat baik
8159520 di sinilah tempat yang sangat efektif karena di dalam rumah ibadah ada dogma ada dakwah ada semacam legitimasi pada umat pengikutnya untuk menyakini apa saja
8159521 tidak sekedar sakral dengan orientasi vertikal tetapi peka terhadap kehidupan sosial dengan orientasi horizontal dari sinilah kemudian lahir sebuah perdamaian
8159522 selain memperdalam khasanah khusus ajaran agamanya juga menanamkan agenda semua agama yang ada seperti memerangi kemiskinan pelestarian lingkungan pendidikan dsg
8159523 meskipun pernah mengalami diskriminasi tetapi mereka tetap mengaku sebagai bagian dari bangsa indonesia
8159524 mereka tidak memandang perbedaan ras dan agama sebagai suatu penghalang untuk berkarya membangun bangsa ini
8159525 saya pikir kalau hal itu upaya untuk mengkontaminasi rekan rekan terhadap wacana pluralisme kerukunan dan perdamaian menurut saya kata kontaminasi sudah tepat sebab ketika berkunjung pasti ada interaksi dan interaksi itu akan mengendap dan akan tumbuh sewaktu waktu menjadi pengalaman tersendiri
8159526 saya pikir itu upaya yang palsu yang sewaktu waktu justru bisa menjadi potensi konflik
8159527 ini kan menunjukkan bahwa kita ketakutan ada orang yang bisa mendirikan rumah ibadah lebih banyak dari kita
8159528 soekarno dan hatta ketika memproklamirkan bangsa ini usianya juga masih muda tetapi kenapa anak muda sekarang diremehkan
8159529 kalau perbedaan perbedaan diantara kita yang kita sembunyikan pada saatnya muncul kita bisa pecah konflik lagi
8159530 misalnya ketika asfin merasa kurang sreg dengan ucapan assalamualaikum sebaliknya saya jika ada teman kristen mengucapkan salam kepada saya saya merasa bangga orang kristen itu juga bangga bisa mengucapkan assalamuaiakum kepada saya yang muslim menurut saya itulah merayakan perbedaan
8159531 kalau saya bisa mengucap om swasti astu kepada rekan rekan hindu dan anda yang hindu senang menerima itu inilah merayakan perbedaan
8159532 i dont have words i am just honoured its going to be a crazy year
8159533 if somebody says something nasty about you it makes you upset
8159534 but ive said that its not representative of anybody and the support ive got it makes you proud to be irish
8159535 contrary to media reports britney was never slated to perform on this years
8159536 shes in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and her focus remains on the studio
8159537 comeback performance during last years vmas was one of the most talked about moments of 2007
8159538 paramount pictures studios in los angeles previously announced award show performers include buying a laptop
8159539 the higher operating revenues were achieved from organic growth from the existing customer base and the impact of our recent acquisitions the company said
8159540 the highly publicised increasing costs of fuel has had a negative impact on the performance of the business in both may and june as the additional costs are not fully recoverable until july and august
8159541 the escalating cost of fuel can be expected to flow through to the ultimate consumer therefore impacting the strength of the broader economy
8159542 however economic conditions that currently prevail may lead to uncertain times ahead the company said
8159543 we are confident that we are well placed to deal with these uncertain trading conditions in the new financial year
8159544 we invested in the business based on a target growth rate in revenue that we did not acheive and as a result the profit result was well below our expectations he said
8159545 we rode that wave in radio really well he said
8159546 this year the august month was clearly impacted by the olympics we expected that
8159547 but over that national advertising is certainly softer tighter more cautious than it was 12 months ago
8159548 relatively well and flagged cost cuts to adapt to the tougher environment
8159549 theres not a significant benefit in terms of a platform we can offer to national advertisers if were at three rather than five mr dorney said
8159550 the declaration overnight by russian president dmitry medvedev i dont believe is a helpful contribution indeed some may regard that as provocative
8159551 australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and our ongoing position is that we believe that russia should abide by the ceasefire effected through the european union and french president nicolas sarkozy and return its forces to the positions they occupied on august 6 and 7
8159552 of course we are still analysing the full purport of this latest development
8159553 we found the abducted japanese man minutes ago he has been shot several times kuz kunar district governor malim mashouq said
8159554 we are aware of press reports but are still checking a foreign ministry official said in tokyo
8159555 yes they police have found him unfortunately dead noor zaman deputy manager of the organisation in eastern nangarhar province said
8159556 we found the abducted japanese man minutes ago he has been shot several times amp squo amp squo kuz kunar district governor malim mashouq said
8159557 i think well be able to strengthen legislation and apply bandaid solutions to give us breathing space but ultimately if you want to preserve koalas and everything we value such as less crowded beaches and roads then the population has to be stabilised
8159558 i am concerned that the state government is trying to manipulate the national strategy by being seen to be doing something about the dire state of koalas in queensland
8159559 ive read 700 post mortems of urban koalas and i can tell you a lot of these koalas are simply starving to death
8159560 in a broad sense i think ways of rewarding high performance are welcome but the devil is in the detail mr mcalpine said
8159561 so long as its done in a way that reflects the genuine complexity and context of schools and the challenges of both leadership and teaching then i think it will be good thing
8159562 make a real difference but questioned where the funding would come from
8159563 i think it would be much better if the federal government could make direct funding to schools of an average of half a million dollars each and that funding be used to improve the learning in the school rather than the state governments having to meet the federal governments commitments he said
8159564 we are really concerned that this government is really not talking to the people it needs to talk to before its making decisions about whats best for australia she said
8159565 hes stating he knows what parents want well were not sure how hes actually engaged with the parents of state schools when he hasnt run this past the national body
8159566 we dont support any league tables weve seen what they can do in the uk weve seen cases of parents fighting with each other buying addresses raffle tickets so you can get in the line to get into a school thats higher up the league table she said
8159567 its often based on incorrect information and theres much more to a school than the academic results for a start
8159568 i knew it was a robbery the first thought that came to mind was to save the money he told the
8159569 in the midst of the commotion the robbers grabbed the money changers bags thinking that i had already placed the money bag onto the trolley he said
8159570 but not for an average young person we wanted to re brand politics by young people for young people and bridge the gap between social life and politics
8159571 thanks to their work were going to see the trend in increased young voter participation continue
8159572 they could potentially swing battleground states and most likely have a dramatic impact on less well known down ballot races where a few thousand or few hundred votes can make the difference
8159573 its an amendment to the constitution on the ballot this november
8159574 when youth are participants in their political process they can be extremely effective in bringing about positive change
8159575 the first part of vote naked was making sure everybody was registered to vote and registered under their current address
8159576 we did a cool youtube video and had a bunch of swag that said vote naked on it and it really caught on
8159577 right now so many groups are doing voter registration but after the election theyll all leave
8159578 were pretty much the only ones out there doing it year round and not just gearing up for a general election
8159579 to be honest i dont think a lot of people knew what caucus meant
8159580 if youre not in a state that has a big caucus like some of the states that come early you wouldnt even know that you had a caucus
8159581 one of them was rock out with your caucus out that was really just an awareness campaign to get people to volunteer for caucus day know where their site is and to get their friends there
8159582 essentially its um two people kind of getting it on its steamy and over the top but meant to be funny
8159583 at the very end you see the girl kind of rolling her eyes and theyre done and then it says beware the caucus comes early this year then it gives you information on what it means to be a caucus state when it is and how you should be prepared for it
8159584 and it was very much geared towards educating people about the caucus we still ended up taking it down
8159585 it was chaos we never had more than a handful of people show up before this year we had hundreds at each site
8159586 i think all nine of those people in 2004 were homeowners who lived on the outskirts of campus so we had a huge increase with a lot of energy all of our volunteers ran the caucus they did all the sign in counted the official ballots and reported the results to the party
8159587 it gave me a sense of community and helped me not think about things that might be stressing me out like school or whatever
8159588 my favorite part of new era is called roll call where we register voters on roller skates and dress crazy its more fun than a regular bar crawl on any other saturday night
8159589 were bringing back people to people politics one bus trip at a time and then we throw a post trip party with all the typical tomfoolery
8159590 come on who really cares about expensive college tuition the economy or the job market and the future of our planet
8159591 if young people stay out of the process it means more pie for all of the other groups
8159592 the only thing young people have to lose or gain is their future
8159593 i would love to see new era colorado create more media like videos podcasts and publications to further take advantage of the way in which youth communicate
8159594 i think a lot of people are looking to see what happens in 2008
8159595 tengo el gusto de conocer a jeff desde mis primeros a os en hollywood siendo el propio freilich quien me seleccion para trabajar junto a
8159596 the complaints are rising and were seeing a lot of green pools
8159597 i think you ought to give credit to kevin mannion
8159598 kevin has really had a great camp i dont think it takes anything away from simoni at all
8159599 this is pretty uncommon to see a young healthy person die within a relatively short amount of time from a fairly common organism
8159600 it seems logical that its mrsa but i cant say without a doubt
8159601 it may be a very very subtle entry into the skin and it gets into the bloodstream
8159602 once its past the skin barrier it can be quite a problem
8159603 we need to get out of our ivory tower philosophies and down on the ground where people live
8159604 it looks like we will continue to be weak until the end of this year and into next year it could be a year from now until we see things get better
8159605 i told her imagine what it must be like for an iraqi
8159606 just cause i call clinton a bitch doesnt make me sexist i love women
8159607 the writer of these lines is a man about your age who was and still is dreaming like you of change and reforms in our countries legitimate dreams all too often turn into horrifying nightmares
8159608 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
8159609 im here tonight as a proud mother as a proud democrat as a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8159610 my champions my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits you never gave in you never gave up and together we made history
8159611 by a family of pragmatic hardworking kansans who believe in faith in family and in community
8159612 barack obama has a plan to save the dream of homeownership for families whove lost their homes or fear they can never afford one unlike john mccain who has so many he cant keep track of them all
8159613 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home well in john mccains version theres no place like home and a home and home
8159614 a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8159615 i dont know about you but thats just not right thats four more years that we cant just afford
8159616 and a whole lot of good folks who didnt see themselves as either democrats or republicans but as virginians
8159617 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8159618 if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8159619 for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
8159620 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8159621 the declaration overnight by russian president dmitry medvedev i dont believe is a helpful contribution indeed some may regard that as provocative
8159622 australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and our ongoing position is that we believe that russia should abide by the ceasefire effected through the european union and french president nicolas sarkozy and return its forces to the positions they occupied on august 6 and 7
8159623 of course we are still analysing the full purport of this latest development

8159635 we are aware of press reports but are still checking a foreign ministry official said in tokyo
8159636 yes they police have found him unfortunately dead noor zaman deputy manager of the organisation in eastern nangarhar province said
8159637 we found the abducted japanese man minutes ago he has been shot several times kuz kunar district governor malim mashouq said
8159638 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war but we dont want t and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8159639 i think well be able to strengthen legislation and apply bandaid solutions to give us breathing space but ultimately if you want to preserve koalas and everything we value such as less crowded beaches and roads then the population has to be stabilised
8159640 i am concerned that the state government is trying to manipulate the national strategy by being seen to be doing something about the dire state of koalas in queensland
8159641 ive read 700 post mortems of urban koalas and i can tell you a lot of these koalas are simply starving to death
8159642 in a broad sense i think ways of rewarding high performance are welcome but the devil is in the detail mr mcalpine said
8159643 so long as its done in a way that reflects the genuine complexity and context of schools and the challenges of both leadership and teaching then i think it will be good thing
8159644 make a real difference but questioned where the funding would come from
8159645 i think it would be much better if the federal government could make direct funding to schools of an average of half a million dollars each and that funding be used to improve the learning in the school rather than the state governments having to meet the federal governments commitments he said
8159646 we are really concerned that this government is really not talking to the people it needs to talk to before its making decisions about whats best for australia she said
8159647 hes stating he knows what parents want well were not sure how hes actually engaged with the parents of state schools when he hasnt run this past the national body
8159648 we dont support any league tables weve seen what they can do in the uk weve seen cases of parents fighting with each other buying addresses raffle tickets so you can get in the line to get into a school thats higher up the league table she said
8159649 its often based on incorrect information and theres much more to a school than the academic results for a start
8159650 it was sort of funny to watch the city and the newspaper which i think overreacted to the possibility of drama on the streets
8159651 this was the anti confrontation confrontation it was more like duty at coors field you arrest a few drunks and sit back and watch the baseball game
8159652 its fun to have the whole media world looking at you
8159653 hell make the acceptance speech in front of 75 000 people at invesco field at mile high which is normally where we watch the broncos which are in most cases the most important story that happens in denver
8159654 but in this case i think barack obama might even be a little more important than that
8159655 for us this is like normandy its that big of a deal and hopefully it will come out ok in the end

8159667 since that time omega has had a total transformation here just like china itself
8159668 goldeneye was released that year and it was at just the time that our market in china was really starting to develop
8159669 it was a powerful indicator of just how much the country has been opening up
8159670 was a huge present for me it was like living a dream
8159671 it was 120 pages long on those 120 pages there was one horse mine
8159672 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8159673 these guys in parliament are so wrong when it comes to slavery i cant be a part of an institution that supports this therefore im leaving and he may be transformed in the process as well

8159680 the goal of the tracemonkey project which is still in its early stages is to take javascript performance to another level where instead of competing against other interpreters we start to compete against native code
8159681 even with this very very early version were already seeing some promising results a simple for loop is getting close to unoptimized gcc
8159682 actually as long as you are running a good anti virus and firewall you are pretty safe
8159683 if when linux becomes mainstream it will suffer from the same problems windows does once the malware virus coders focus on it and they are froced to patch it as often was ms does
8159684 things have now evolved to the point where linux subsystems are set up so that you can use a removable device in the same way you use them in windows
8159685 i managed to fix it over ssh using my mobile phone while i was on a train try doing that with windows
8159686 you can use a removable device in the same way you use them in windows
8159687 even though linux has reached well beyond its school project roots linux users tend to be soapbox dwelling fanatics who are quick to spout off about why you should be choosing linux over windows
8159688 there are just as many help sites lists forums for windows as there are for linux

8159690 10 sets of rambling disjointed thoughts full of fallacies and assumptions on both sides
8159691 this is not in the least to say one is better than the other
8159692 well i think my reputation and opinion precedes me so i probably dont need to say i feel strongly that the advantage leans toward linux
8159693 we dont have a single box with mainframes power lets get them to share the work
8159694 he said he is feeling better and is ready to go home
8159695 he was not totally unconscious but it was hurting him he was moving his arms when they took him away on the stretcher
8159696 a witness near him saw what he believed was a spark of electricity between him and the tool he was reaching for
8159697 a few guys saw it but im not sure if it hit him or right beside him
8159698 one of the guys said it hit the top of his head but i didnt see his shoes messed up
8159699 i knew it hit somewhere i could tell it was close then everybody started yelling and i ran over there

8159708 i thought it was good i thought it was just really straightforward tonight tuesday nothing super special i didnt try anything too crazy
8159709 if anything i tried something a little opposite than i usually try i think i tried a little less and tried to be a little more consistent so that was actually something new

8159716 we need to back up rural and regional sa for the long term
8159717 so i am asking the premier to get his department to establish the impact on rural and regional communities as a result of this massive drop in income loss of jobs from and hardship in the sector
8159718 we need to establish the impact these losses have had on rural and regional sa and what initiatives need to be put forward to assist rural and regional communities to regrow their economies
8159719 with the decline in manufacturing and our critical need for food security that is to feed ourselves we must look after this critical industry
8159720 the computer models are all over the place right now
8159721 its too early to theorize on galveston the potential is there but its too early to narrow down where it might go
8159722 weve basically taken a ton of lessons that weve learned from lonelygirl15 and katemodern and were applying it to this new series trying to make it more accessible to a passive audience
8159723 during the week rather than it being five videos that are these posts that the characters are making leading up to this episode its going to be a text blog maybe a photo post its not all going to be video content
8159724 i love buffy and im a big joss whedon fan
8159725 some of the commenters on our forum were on the original buffy forum back in the day they were calling the world of lg15 originally the breenaverse
8159726 in general its certainly great to have the big traditional people and new media companies producing content for this space
8159727 it helps consolidate the medium it makes advertisers feel more comfortable and it just makes the market bigger
8159728 there have been some isolated programs that have been funded by the department
8159729 but comprehensive understanding that keeping kids out of detention is actually a community building strategy and something that we need to invest in is something that hasnt reached the mainstream policy makers
8159730 barack is a fine person but i dont think hes ready to be president
8159731 well be monitoring every word that comes from the podium looking for factual inaccuracies responding with whats appropriate
8159732 its important because you cant let a news cycle much less an hour or two hours go with an attack that is a distortion of your candidates record

8159738 dell will take advantage of a licensing option in vista business and vista ultimate that lets pc makers provide xp under the vista license which microsoft calls a

8159748 it was a lot similar to those games last year very much so
8159749 i think any time somebody pops off i think it catches some fire to it between the media and the fans and our players
8159750 i think our players hear that and they kind of take that to heart they get up and they get more determined and everything thats kind of like fighting words it kind of sets them off
8159751 if you notice we seem like we are in a more business frame of mind so that means we dont particularly want to associate with them i like that ive always liked that i think when we come to the ballpark when i put my uniform on were going to come out here and beat you i dont have any friends on the field when were playing weve got a couple guys like that and i really love that part about them

8159759 whoever he picks as vice president could become the next guy in line if he picks a mainstream conservative then the conservatives can get excited not just about the mccain candidacy but the future of the party
8159760 a week ago romney and pawlenty looked like the two most likely conservative choices but i think over the last several days events have conspired against both of them
8159761 i think his aides floated the idea of lieberman to prove to mccain that it would get knocked down
8159762 whatever is done from love always occurs beyond good and evil
8159763 in the end one loves ones desire and not what is desired
8159764 the best friend will probably acquire the best wife because a good marriage is founded on the talent for friendship
8159765 heaven is not a place its just an idea but its a very strong idea because if we didnt have it we wouldnt have any hope
8159766 madness is rare in individuals but in groups parties nations and ages it is the rule
8159767 he who does not know how to put his thoughts on ice ought not to enter into the heat of battle
8159768 if we live together with another person too closely what happens is similar to when we repeatedly handle a good engraving with our bare hands one day all we have left is a piece of dirty paper the soul of a human being too can finally become tattered by being handled continually and that is how it finally appears to us we never see the beauty of its original design again
8159769 never to speak about oneself is a very noble piece of hypocrisy talking much about oneself can also be a means to conceal oneself

8159779 de amerikaanse autoconstructeurs investeren massaal in de auto van de toekomst als wij die autos ook willen produceren zullen de belgische productiecentra van ford en general motors in genk en antwerpen zware inspanningen moeten leveren
8159780 de stijging van de brandstofprijzen heeft in de vs gezorgd voor een mentaliteitswijziging zonder voorgaande voor ons is vier dollar voor een gallon ongeveer 3 8 liter niet veel maar in de vs heeft dat gezorgd voor een ommezwaai
8159781 maar het is niet populair om voor de autoconstructeurs op te komen het is gemakkelijker om er op te schieten
8159782 de amerikaanse constructeurs willen tegen het jaar 2020 de co2 uitstoot met ruim 30 procent verminderen dan staan ze ongeveer even ver als europa nu en dat is toch wel onthutsend
8159783 de auto van de toekomst kan even goed geproduceerd worden in china hongarije als in belgi als wij willen dat die autos in genk of antwerpen worden geproduceerd zullen daar zware inspanningen voor geleverd moeten worden werkgevers vakbonden en overheid zullen opnieuw rond de tafel moeten zitten zodat ons land niet uit de boot valt
8159784 toch zijn biobrandstoffen op korte termijn het beste middel om iets aan de schadelijke emissies te doen
8159785 zo blijkt dat bio ethanol in de toekomst vooral zal gemaakt worden van afvalproducten in de vs wordt volop de kaart getrokken van ethanol nu de prijzen van diesel en benzine naar elkaar toegroeien kan ethanol ook voor europa een goed alternatief zijn
8159786 als we ons niet haasten halen we nooit de 5 procent en zullen we door europa aangepakt worden
8159787 het is goed dat europa die limiet naar voor schuift ik pleit wel voor een systeem van beloningen voor autoconstructeurs die extreem milieuvriendelijke autos op de markt brengen
8159788 vooral deze brug is een dumpingplaats dit jaar hebben we hier al een achttal voertuigen bovengehaald
8159789 barack is a fine person but i dont think hes ready to be president
8159790 well be monitoring every word that comes from the podium looking for factual inaccuracies responding with whats appropriate
8159791 its important because you cant let a news cycle much less an hour or two hours go with an attack that is a distortion of your candidates record
8159792 chevrolet has always stood for expressive value and cruze delivers on that promise like never before
8159793 if you were to say who is the unluckiest person i know in the world
8159794 if you were to say who is the luckiest person i know in the world
8159795 not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8159796 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer
8159797 he is handsome hes incredibly bright hes incredibly well spoken and hes incredibly successful
8159798 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy sound bite
8159799 you know were democrats theres always somebody complaining about something
8159800 but i dont think anybody is distraught that ed rendell has compared sen obama to adlai stevenson
8159801 im just here to cover the most important state in the union pennsylvanias going to decide the election
8159802 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8159803 i think average voters are turned off by the tearing down
8159804 but not by the building up i think voters like to see people coming together
8159805 hillary at points disappointed me on how far she went to try to tear barack down but i take my hat off to her for how shes handling it now
8159806 it depends how much you want to win all that early stuff was intramural sports now were into the real season and in the end she wants him to win i believe that
8159807 the question is does that tough clinton obama primary make obama tougher a lot of hillary supporters are saying yes
8159808 i believe it does you really dont know what to believe
8159809 rising fuel prices and general economic concerns are making people think carefully about how they drive
8159810 the upshot of less traffic is a drop in congestion levels meaning motorists can get from a to b quicker while travelling at lower and more economical speeds
8159811 esto asciende a una suma mensual de un mill n de pesos por ser abogado de la corporaci n sin que se haya podido demostrar que l haya prestado servicios a sta lo que nos hace presumir que estar amos frente a una figura similar por la que fue suspendido

8159819 theyre committed to an election well before then oct 19 2009 if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behoves the government to provide some responsibility
8159820 the opening is to talk at any opportunity not to wait three weeks to have a meeting obviously that indicates a fundamental difference between the government and the opposition parties
8159821 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8159822 he wants to go to an election before canadians see he is ill prepared to face the difficulties of the economy

8159826 the race for the future will be won when old partisanship gives way to new ideas and when hope replaces fear
8159827 right now in this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right and the status quo just wont cut it
8159828 the district now has around 40 homestays most of them have come up in the last three years
8159829 we come to know about these homestays largely when we process their application under the classification scheme
8159830 there may be many others but we have no way of knowing about them
8159831 most of the tourists coming to wayanad at present are it information technology professionals from bangalore only five percent of total tourists who visited the district last year are foreigners
8159832 in wayanad there is a shortage of rooms we need around 1 000 rooms but we have only 400 now
8159833 i think there are around 60 homestays in wayanad but we have to see how many of them offer quality service to tourists
8159834 many of them are arabs who come to the nearby resorts we offer them a cruise on our 12 seat boat
8159835 we have tie ups with around 50 homestays and resorts in various parts of the state many of them are located in wayanad
8159836 we also had a few corporate customers who wanted to organise their get togethers at resorts
8159837 only a small number of tourists visit the beaches here the numbers are very small compared to tourists visiting beaches like kovalam foreign tourists are not visiting our beaches here because we lack good infrastructure and proper marketing
8159838 people here are not worried much about skimpily clad tourists sunbathing on beaches the tourists on their part are aware of the culture here we also mention this in the leaflets provided to them they usually take care to dress in a way that it wont hurt the sentiments of the people
8159839 this kind of cultural problems could be affecting tourist inflow here but it is not a major problem
8159840 nowadays not many people stare at tourists about 10 years ago this was not the case
8159841 i am writing to you to urge you to oppose an exemption for india from the rules of the 45 nation nuclear suppliers group nsg
8159842 as you know the nsg operates by consensus so by blocking such an exemption south africa can prevent grave damage being done to the international nuclear non proliferation regime
8159843 the us india nuclear agreement effectively grants india the privileges of nuclear weapons states nws despite the fact that india developed nuclear weapons outside the nunclear non proliferation treaty npt regime the agreement doesnt even require india to accept the same responsibilities as other states i e full scope iaea safeguards for non nws and a commitment from nws to negotiate in good faith for the elimination of nuclear weapons
8159844 it continues to produce highly enriched uranium and plutonium for nuclear weapons and retains the option to test nuclear weapons again in the future under these circumstances an exemption for india offers no benefits it will only serve to set back efforts for nuclear disarmament and undermine the international non proliferation regime
8159845 i think the people of assam cannot ask for anything more as all these world class institutes could go a long way in developing the state in terms of human resource development
8159846 the package is really noteworthy as the prime minister instead of just doling out cash incentives decided to go for specified projects and that too with a vision aimed at developing the skills of local youths by way of setting up several top notch educational facilities
8159847 i have never come across a prime minister like manmohan singh who has generously agreed to all our proposals this shows how sincere and committed the prime minister is to the welfare and development of the state
8159848 i think all these time bound projects would help develop assam by leaps and bounds
8159849 announcing the decision to recognise the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia
8159850 by the aggressive attack against south ossetia on the night of aug 8 2008 which resulted in numerous human losses including among the peacekeepers and other russian citizens and by the preparation of a similar action against abkhazia georgian president mikhail saakashvili has himself dashed the possibility of the territorial integrity of georgia
8159851 the unilateral recognition of georgian provinces is a breach of fundamental norms and principles of international law on territorial integrity sovereignty and inviolability of the borders of the states
8159852 the russian action directly contradicts all un security council resolutions
8159853 georgia will exercise all possible diplomatic means to preserve its territorial integrity and sovereignty
8159854 along with a full respect of territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia within its internationally recognised borders
8159855 we are ready to address this issue and explore ways in a way that would potentially have secured consensus of the security council
8159856 however todays decision by russia makes it much more complicated to continue this discussion
8159857 catalu a sola gana la mitad de las medallas de espa a
8159858 personally it doesnt bother me but in the context of a place of business you should respect their dress code if they have one
8159859 why would you ever need to go shirtless in public
8159860 i dont like that at all theyre all sweaty and gross looking
8159861 skin has a long association with intimacy or sexuality and for a long time society has thought sexuality belongs in the private sphere
8159862 some people might see a pot belly or the man boobs as they say and say e www they dont want to see it
8159863 on the other hand some people enjoy seeing good examples of our aesthetics
8159864 i just think its too much information it also seems kind of unhygienic
8159865 its ok at the pool or jogging in the park its not ok in a business its not ok at stadiums unless you have your chest painted some color
8159866 you cant really discriminate if youve got someone whos a little overweight if the guys comfortable letting it all hang out more power to him
8159867 people got more careful about the impressions they gave off monitored themselves and the reactions of others as the gaze increasingly focused on behavior and the body all manner of social prescriptions and taboos came to rest on the body
8159868 transgressing these norms sends a message to people which is a kind of a threat
8159869 out on their backyard decks sunning themselves sure in an airplane or anywhere else where strangers must sit near them which includes the stands of athletic stadiums no clothing standards are a matter of context would you trust your lawyer if you showed up to consult him and found him sitting in his office half naked
8159870 today you can see matthew mcconaughey and all these guys running around shirtless
8159871 the refrain i hear is you dont want to be the guy at the beach with the hairy back that people are snickering at
8159872 so much of it is about sex appeal they want to look and feel attractive whether theyre straight or gay and the criteria for that is broadening
8159873 lets put it this way if we go bike riding his shirts off
8159874 it creeps me out that people can represent themselves as whoever they want to be through these online profiles
8159875 everyone represents themselves as what they wish they could be and not what they are
8159876 if somebody messages too much teenagers think of that person as a weirdo
8159877 thats a way of developing a norm for who youre going to engage with
8159878 i have a job i have a little baby i have a social life
8159879 it seems like an added burden every day i get a hundred e mails and the last thing i want to do is go on a site to see if people are contacting me
8159880 people find you on it then they send you e mails and its almost like leave me alone
8159881 as a stay at home mom its nice to connect with grown up people during the day and have real adult socialization
8159882 the users are always going to be way smarter than we could ever be
8159883 we have to respect that and give them what they want
8159884 we must be willing to take the lead in the health matters that affect us and those we love and it can begin with a visit to the doctor
8159885 i would wander in all the time and then i offered to substitute there once i did i realized that i was finally in the right place
8159886 i hope that someday somebody wants to hold you for twenty minutes straight and thats all they do they dont pull away they dont look at your face they dont try to kiss you all they do is wrap you up in their arms without an ounce of selfishness in it
8159887 never discuss sex politics finances or religion in polite society
8159888 even the devil can quote scripture for his own purpose
8159889 do not tell me what a man believes but rather what a man loves then i will tell you what kind of man he is
8159890 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the twenty first century
8159891 sheriff has a lot of explaining to do about bugging incident
8159892 pakistanis will cash in on it it serves their interest to liven up the issue they have already livened up the border with ceasefire violations and increasing instances of cross border firing
8159893 it will be internationalised and questions will be asked in the international fora
8159894 india has succeeded in internationalising the issue after bringing it firmly in the ambit of the bilateral dialogue process its a setback
8159895 kashmir was being discussed in the back channels its now out in the open and will encourage pakistan to make it the main issue in the composite dialogue process
8159896 for the moment they are not taking full advantage of the situation but they will do so
8159897 this is not a military issue any more it is a mass movement kashmir is indias northern ireland its basque problem
8159898 we will solve these issues bilaterally we want to be seen as fair minded as the government defuses the crisis
8159899 violence had declined due to capacity constraints on the part of pakistan due to its internal turmoil and increasing international pressure on pakistan over taliban and terrorism and not because of a change in the governments policy
8159900 we have to be vigilant against pakistans attempts to capitalise on unrest
8159901 elections are a crucial component of this process militants will do everything to make it a more eventful and violent election
8159902 in a broad sense i think ways of rewarding high performance are welcome but the devil is in the detail mr mcalpine said
8159903 so long as its done in a way that reflects the genuine complexity and context of schools and the challenges of both leadership and teaching then i think it will be good thing
8159904 make a real difference but questioned where the funding would come from
8159905 i think it would be much better if the federal government could make direct funding to schools of an average of half a million dollars each and that funding be used to improve the learning in the school rather than the state governments having to meet the federal governments commitments he said
8159906 we are really concerned that this government is really not talking to the people it needs to talk to before its making decisions about whats best for australia she said
8159907 hes stating he knows what parents want well were not sure how hes actually engaged with the parents of state schools when he hasnt run this past the national body
8159908 we dont support any league tables weve seen what they can do in the uk weve seen cases of parents fighting with each other buying addresses raffle tickets so you can get in the line to get into a school thats higher up the league table she said
8159909 its often based on incorrect information and theres much more to a school than the academic results for a start
8159910 a clear message that the jury wants these parties to fight in the marketplace and not in the courtroom we are disappointed that they awarded any damages however it is a rebuke to mattels aggressive and overreaching tactics
8159911 were pleased that the jury agreed with mattel that what mga did was wrong and that damages were awarded
8159912 under the decree recognising independence of both republics which i have signed our country will help abkhazia and south ossetia to ensure their security and if they are attacked we will certainly offer them appropriate support
8159913 a special case in kosovo a special case in abkhazia and south ossetia
8159914 until recently we tried to help restore georgias state unity but the last nail was driven in following georgias decision to attack
8159915 as to our involvement in other conflicts we naturally are not going to do this
8159916 however russia is a state which has to ensure its interests along the entire length of its border this is absolutely clear
8159917 forty eight people have been booked under the ndps act this year last year 29 people had been booked
8159918 we are aware of the problem and it has to be curbed
8159919 were launching a special month long drive from sep 1 in kullu mandi and chamba districts this is the time the poppy crop is ready for harvest
8159920 during the drive were taking the help of 18 sniffer dogs to detect houses in villages where hashish and opium have been stored
8159921 people involved in this clandestine trade are spreading their wings by luring more villagers into this multi billion dollar trade alternative farming is the only way to control cannabis cultivation
8159922 i knew it was a robbery the first thought that came to mind was to save the money he told the

8159940 when a wednesday which addresses itself to an issue thats close to mr modi as a politician was ready i wanted him to watch it i called him and requested him to do so
8159941 mr modis counter request was tell me the story in two lines i told him he immediately agreed then his staff got into action and a date was set
8159942 it the screening went off fabulously let me tell you media perceptions of mr modi are completely wrong he is misunderstood because he is outspoken he is a politician destined for very big things the good thing was he came with no prejudices and he brought his entire ministry and government machinery with him
8159943 its very important for us actors to come forward and help a film thats done with sincerity of purpose and has got a message behind it
8159944 tahaan is a kashmiri fable its got some interesting actors but the best performances come from child actor purav bhandare and then the donkey who plays his companion all others in the cast have to take a backseat to the duo
8159945 my three films in two weeks offer me a chance to play completely different characters
8159946 theres so much new talent and appreciation for them sachin yardi who has directed c kkompany and neeraj pandey who has directed a wednesday will be major names after their films release
8159947 there are no plans that i know of to change the agreement but you know in life you never rule things out
8159948 but its obviously got to be something that both the united states and india can agree to if there were going to be changes
8159949 but ive heard no mention of a need to you know adjust the agreement in any way
8159950 were working very hard we would like to see this agreement come into fruition because its critically important for both the united states and india
8159951 and we are aware that the congressional clock is ticking and we are going to be consulting with other governments particularly governments in the nsg to try to move this process forward as quickly as we can
8159952 but theyre good questions and we think weve got good answers to those
8159953 we are aware that the clock is ticking but it is a very important agreement for both countries and we want to see it happen
8159954 well do our best to address those concerns as the indians are trying to do to address concerns that other governments may have about the agreement
8159955 i think we have to see how this plays out its very important as i said to come to fruition on this agreement and so it wouldnt do any good for me to speculate on what may or may not happen at this point
8159956 harassing the superintendent of the womens protection home by persistently pressing for information
8159957 some of the questions he asked were irrelevant like who is responsible for munnis barbadi depredation how can i name any official

8159975 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8159976 i think well be able to strengthen legislation and apply bandaid solutions to give us breathing space but ultimately if you want to preserve koalas and everything we value such as less crowded beaches and roads then the population has to be stabilised
8159977 i am concerned that the state government is trying to manipulate the national strategy by being seen to be doing something about the dire state of koalas in queensland
8159978 ive read 700 post mortems of urban koalas and i can tell you a lot of these koalas are simply starving to death
8159979 the declaration overnight by russian president dmitry medvedev i dont believe is a helpful contribution indeed some may regard that as provocative
8159980 australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and our ongoing position is that we believe that russia should abide by the ceasefire effected through the european union and french president nicolas sarkozy and return its forces to the positions they occupied on august 6 and 7
8159981 of course we are still analysing the full purport of this latest development
8159982 next generation supply chain staying competitive in the global marketplace
8159983 to a grocery retailer entering a produce cooler first thing in the morning its common to see collapsed corrugated cardboard boxes of fruit and vegetables hopefully not a lot of the product is damaged and discarded and hopefully a lot of time isnt consumed in cleaning the mess
8159984 this is about women in general i think theres going to be another movement coming a different kind of movement of women for women weve been silent for some time
8159985 i think the grave mistreatment of hillary during the primary has been an awakening for a lot of women who didnt consider themselves to be feminists in the past
8159986 millions of folks feel like the democratic party abandoned its loyal base of women in this election
8159987 we believe that once women in this country have power in government and the workplace and money things like abortion will not even be on the table for discussion
8159988 the womens movement needs to stand up and say sexism is wrong we made a mistake because we allowed it to happen and we will not do that again to women or any other group
8159989 women are like tea bags they never know how strong they are until theyre in hot water
8159990 we have to educate these women who are disappointed hillary didnt win
8159991 we have to help them to understand whats at stake we cant have mccain appointing two supreme court vacancies
8159992 fmd is shifting toward generating fees via providing origination and marketing services to lenders
8159993 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8159994 or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8159995 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8159996 i want you to think about your children and grandchildren come election day
8159997 weve got to ensure that the choice we make in this election honors the sacrifices of all who came before us and will fill the lives of our children with possibility and hope
8159998 this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8159999 we believe that everyone should have an opportunity to get ahead and with success comes a responsibility to make sure others can follow
