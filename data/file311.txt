3110000 we are now in a fight against the great russia
3110001 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own
3110002 its important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
3110003 we need help from the un and from our friends headed by the united states and israel today georgia is in danger tomorrow all the democratic countries in the region and in the entire world will be in danger too
3110004 why not just down tune why not why the fuck not
3110005 ummm i came from school and went to a friends shindig
3110006 i just wanted to see if you were carryin any alcohol or drugs
3110007 in light of what we have seen this year in horror

3110014 can you keep an eye on this for a second for me
3110015 its particularly a moment where john mccain can claim to have been prescient
3110016 david broder is this a 3 a m moment for foreign policy for these candidates
3110017 it is and its particularly a moment where john mccain can claim to have been prescient because in his basic foreign policy speech two months ago and in an interview that i did with him last week he draws a very sharp line when it comes to russia he says these people are being aggressive and imperialist there is no confusion in his mind about the character of the putin medvedev government and he is prepared i think to make the case that this is a demonstration of exactly what he has been arguing for
3110018 appears to have been ahead of the curve in his assessment that moscow was the bad actor here
3110019 when violence broke out in the caucasus friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position it has been a rough few weeks for mccain on the foreign policy front paging dr maliki but he appears to have been ahead of the curve in his assessment that moscow was the bad actor here
3110020 its not just this part of the world but senator mccain has been to so many exotic places like waziristan and south ossetia and hes very comfortable with these issues he knows what he thinks
3110021 do i believe i can improve as a player yes
3110022 i have probably been the leading player in europe for close to six years
3110023 its a big step to move up now and start competing on a different level im world number three and ive got phil and tiger ahead of me
3110024 i dont necessarily pay attention to what theyre doing i pay attention more to what im doing
3110025 throughout my career ive always applied myself looked for what would improve my game found that and worked on it to improve
3110026 but its always taken some time ive had lulls where ive been in between things and come out stronger
3110027 it is a long way to catch tiger at the top but i know the only way of focusing on doing that is focusing on me what im doing controlling what i can do i cant control tiger or phil
3110028 i probably pushed too hard on the 17th hole thinking i needed to get back after making my first bogey of the day on the 16th
3110029 but i walked away from that tournament knowing i could win a major
3110030 he won the league and the cup and it would be irresponsible to replace shum to improve we need to add another experienced man who will work together with him
3110031 ivan has a wealth of experience having played at the highest level for many years and he can be a great asset for us
3110032 there will certainly be pressure it all depends on how we manage it
3110033 if we manage it well it will motivate us if we handle it poorly it could be like a storm
3110034 what happened was that i went to georgia tech and north carolina didnt want me to we parted ways and i decided to back off my commitment im not really looking at north carolina anymore
3110035 now im going to look at miami west virginia and georgia tech
3110036 i liked the campus and facilities the weight room was pretty good i got to talk to one of the coaches it was a good visit
3110037 i like both of them west virginia is a top school that is always going to bowl games miami is a respectable school to go to i plan to visit both of them and make my decision soon about what school i want to go to
3110038 i just want to look for a good degree a school that cares and somewhere i can get playing time
3110039 i like to play in big games against good competition
3110040 im really looking forward to next year thats the biggest thing
3110041 this year i have been handicapped the whole time i probably should have had this done at the end of last year i drove the wheels off that car and now its time to get a new one
3110042 probably there are few women who have not had some first friendship
3110043 its interesting how the author constantly compares it to love but never says it actually is
3110044 and yet it is not the real thing not friendship but rather a kind of as jealous as exacting as unreasoning as wildly happy and supremely miserable ridiculously so to a looker on but to the parties concerned as vivid and sincere as any after passion into which the girl may fall for the time being perhaps long after colouring all her world yet it is but a dream to melt away like a dream when love appears or if it then wishes to keep up its vitality at all it must change its character temper its exactions resign its rights in short be buried and come to life again in a totally different form
3110045 afterwards should laura and matilda with a house to mind and a husband to fuss over find themselves actually kissing the babies instead of one another

3110059 the majority of georgia amp squo s territory is occupied
3110060 until now all that we have had from the international community is humanitarian aid which is starting to arrive and statements
3110061 of course this is important but we need much more
3110062 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3110063 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3110064 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future
3110065 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication
3110066 the soldiers were provided with combat first aid by other members of the sotg to stabilise their condition and the area surrounding the blast site was secured in preparation for a helicopter casualty evacuation
3110067 the prime minister was freed this afternoon along with three other government officials i understand that only the president is still being held
3110068 the six representatives firmly condemned the coup and said it was unacceptable to overthrow a democratically elected president and demanded that the president and his prime minister are set free and constitutional order is restored

3110079 tbilisi was bombed bombs hit the village of kojori and makhata mountain
3110080 ceasefire agreement is signed by two sides when they meet
3110081 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia

3110089 with the live algae we can explain to children and families how algae grow and how we extract the oil and convert it to jet fuel
3110090 however they expressed great interest in the growing algae and the potential it has for production of oil that can be used for transportation fuel especially since using algae eliminates the problem associated with converting crop foods to fuel
3110091 the critical issue is the biomass feedstock not oil conversion
3110092 to bring the cost down we need much more breakthroughs and innovations bioreactors are expensive at this stage we need a cost efficient way to sustain high growth
3110093 our effort will be geared to developing a pilot scale facility that will enable us to integrate various components of oil production and evaluate the economics of the process
3110094 since asu is a leader in developing approaches to sustainability it could for example incorporate the use of algae produced biofuels on some of its vehicles over the next several years as our production increases

3110100 it was so sad to hear about isaac hayes so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best god bless
3110101 i last saw isaac a while back in washington d c at a concert where we were both performing although he was under the weather he was still performing he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls god bless his family
3110102 three time grammy winner isaac hayes was a true renaissance man singer songwriter producer session musician actor activist and more his groundbreaking theme song and score for the movie shaft cemented his status as a musical icon the world has lost a true creative genius and a passionate humanitarian but his indelible legacy will remain ever present our deepest sympathies go out to his family friends and all who were inspired by the man and his music
3110103 i am shocked we have lost not only an incredible talent but a wonderful leader to his community and a dear friend to me there will only be one isaac hayes gifting us with years of performing writing and a voice that penetrated deep into our souls he is to be admired for changing his life around and standing steadfast to his beliefs his integrity and to helping others isaac you will be missed but never forgotten
3110104 isaac was one of the more genuine and beautiful souls i have had the privilege to cross paths with and befriend in this life he was an incredible friend this is a tragic loss my heart goes out to his wife and children wherever he is going to just became a brighter and more beautiful place and i will miss him dearly
3110105 i owe so much of my fame and success to isaac hayes as it was isaac who wrote produced and actually invented what is known as the

3110111 earlier this year the council together with mayor bloomberg passed the new york city plastic carryout bag recycling law local law 1 of 2008 requiring stores across the city to establish in store recycling programs for plastic bags and film plastic such as plastic wrap dry cleaning bags and newspaper bags the law which officially went into effect on july 23rd applies to stores that use plastic bags and occupy 5 000 or more square feet or have more than five branches operating in new york city despite all the hard work that went into making this law a reality last month the state legislature quietly passed a statewide plastic bag recycling bill that if signed by governor paterson would eliminate the citys program and replace it with a far weaker one dictated by albany for example the states bill would significantly reduce the number of stores in new york city required to recycle plastic bags the states bill also only applies to carryout bags and not film plastic and would do away with the citys ability to enforce any bag recycling law or ensure that businesses are in compliance i am hoping you will join us in calling on albany to take the necessary steps to ensure that the citys plastic bag recycling law remains in full effect please contact the state representatives below and urge them to modify the states bill to allow the citys more robust plastic bag recycling program to continue

3110122 instead we will be going one better and will focus on long term unemployed by requiring them to get paid work and get off the benefit
3110123 within 12 months of taking office national will require everyone who has been on the dole for more than a year to re apply for their benefit and undergo a comprehensive work assessment
3110124 the 1990s is back and today the national party showed how bereft they really are of new ideas
3110125 the reality is that people get off the dpb at the earliest opportunity that they can and evidence that people stay on it longer than they need to be simply isnt there
3110126 long term welfare dependency locks people into a life of limited income and limited choices
3110127 were really indicating that those people are the ones we are going to encourage to undertake 15 hours part time work or training or be at least looking for work

3110129 ive talked to my mum quite a bit and the phones ringing and theres a lot of media interest and of course its just my mum in christchurch shes not equipped to deal with something of this magnitude not that shes not capable its just that its so surreal that all of a sudden she gets drawn into this
3110130 we have a small family in new zealand but were tight i know shes hurting and shes very much a part of the broader picture
3110131 our two families were very close and it is a good in law relationship shes rocked its hard for all of us
3110132 volleyball is my job my family is my life so that distinction has been very easy for me
3110133 i am passionate about the game my job i enjoy coaching volleyball has been wonderful to elisabeth and i but at this stage its very easy for me to focus on the task at hand which is taking care of my immediate family
3110134 once weve got it taken care of we can look at other things in life but right now thats purely where my focus is
3110135 the one thing that has been incredible has been the huge groundswell of support to help us pick up the pieces and help us manage this difficult situation as best as we can he said
3110136 interest has been global but in no way have we exposed ourselves with dealing with our emails and our phonecalls or anything like that its just too overwhelming we appreciate that everyone is with us we are just in no capacity to deal with that right now
3110137 stood for all the right things and he lived them
3110138 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence there is no indication her that there was an pre meditation it seems unfortunately to be a case of the wrong place at the wrong time certainly in our opinion that is the way it seems to be
3110139 it hurts its its something that no one should have to got through lifes not fair so its never going to be about that kind of stuff
3110140 at the end of the day it happened and it seems the the sooner we can come to grips with that and kind of process it the better off were going to be anger isnt an emotion im going to allow myself to indulge in
3110141 certainly the team has been influenced by this its not exactly how you would want to prepare for your first match having to deal with a tragedy of this nature

3110147 discussing a the may 2008 survey of 305 respondents asking questions about 16 factors that have the potential to raise productivity
3110148 seventy nine percent of the most productive organizations say that to a high or very high degree the cultures of their organizations help raise employee productivity
3110149 seventy six percent of highly productive companies said that to a high or very high extent leadership in their companies raises productivity compared with 48 of all respondents
3110150 whereas just 31 of average respondents said their organizations use engagement practices to a high or very high extent to boost productivity 59 of highly productive organizations said they do engagement means that workers are mentally and emotionally invested in their work and in contributing to their employers success
3110151 people like to work for organizations that send strong signals that they care for their employees these particular programs may be sending those signals more than most other types of initiatives do its also possible that such programs actually boost the physical and mental well being of workers leading to higher rates of work productivity
3110152 former president and co founder of greenpeace patrick moore supports nuclear power plants
3110153 going nuclear a green makes the case by patrick moore sunday april 16 2006 page b01
3110154 in the early 1970s when i helped found greenpeace i believed that nuclear energy was synonymous with nuclear holocaust as did most of my compatriots
3110155 and although i dont want to underestimate the very real dangers of nuclear technology in the hands of rogue states we cannot simply ban every technology that is dangerous
3110156 nuclear reactors emit generally low doses of radioactivity into the air and water not just from accidents but during routine operations it is important to understand emission patterns and trends in evaluating safety and health risks
3110157 more students especially those in new york city and other large urban school districts are graduating from high school thats excellent news
3110158 ironically success at closing the achievement gap is threatened by an ill conceived tax cap which offers only the illusion of relief for taxpayers but real pain for children and their schools
3110159 poor districts will simply not have the resources to invest in their schools and will have little chance of over riding the albany imposed cap something more affluent communities will do easily and often a tax cap is simply a gimmick and a way for some politicians to balance their election year needs on the backs of children and public schools
3110160 teachers parents and students are working hard and the higher graduation rates show it
3110161 many students are now taking five to six years to graduate and that kind of persistence and dedication should be rewarded with a continued investment in programs to help them continue their studies
3110162 we know that many students new to our country need additional resources and when we provide additional support they graduate and contribute to the success of our country
3110163 rather than limiting students futures with an arbitrary and destructive tax cap we should continue to invest in programs to help every student graduate high school

3110187 bloggers are free individuals and can write what they want and how they want in their blogs
3110188 in any event this is how my voice gets heard i see that i can assist in making changes
3110189 the blog is sort of like my notebook everyday i jot down things and in order not to lose those references and themes i put them in my blog in addition i see the comments of my readers
3110190 today in armenia theres a very active blogger community and they are active outside the borders of the internet as well apparently these people are active citizens with a definite orientation
3110191 the issue is that political circles and people in general have started to seriously think about transferring their activities to the virtual arena
3110192 blogs are news sources this became apparent after the previous elections and one of the reasons for their development is perhaps the growth of the internets popularity in armenia
3110193 when somebody starts to work at something others join in also
3110194 the role of the blogs in terms of information will only grow with time following the example in western nations the influence of bloggers on political social and cultural life will increase such long term prospects are quite realistic
3110195 in my estimation bloggers are in the 30 40 year old range that are users of the internet and more or less belong to the middle class consequently their opinions cannot possibly reflect the views of the society at large however due to the fact that bloggers are active not only in the internet but in their daily lives has attracted a great amount of attention to the blogs
3110196 according to information at my disposal the national security service attempted to offer money to people or to coax individuals to start up blogs covering certain specific pre election topics or to publicly chide certain candidates
3110197 i dont know if getting paid to run a covert ad is ok or the opposite there was the case of a top economist who ran a blog and received a rating later on he published a few negative blurbs about a certain company as a result the shares of that company dropped drastically the firm went bankrupt and closed its doors afterwards the blogger was taken to court and during the trail he confessed that he had taken money from a competing company
3110198 we must understand that for example the people following livejournal came from the forums they are the same names the same photos they simply migrated from one network to another more up to date one
3110199 a news outlet blog creates a feeling of kinship with the reader also they cover issues that arent written about in the main pages on the paper
3110200 when news reporters run their own blogs firstly they gain recognition and furthermore the news outlet undergoes a process of socialization
3110201 the advantage of the blogosphere lies in its diversity however one still encounters personal insults and the use of uncivilized language
3110202 in general issues and problems related to the life of homosexuals are raised in the pages of gay armenia
3110203 i dont consider myself a blogger in the classical sense im more a carrier of the traditional media but it seems to me that all of this must be consolidated all reporters must see what is taking place in the blogs as a source of material
3110204 it is the human subjective factor thats important for me in the blogs and it is precisely this that differentiates blogs from the news outlets
3110205 i find that blogs are already competing with the news outlets but that this fact isnt fully comprehended this is clearly evident when the activities of the blogs and news outlets are compared side by side heres a fairly crude example our news outlets dont operate from friday evening till monday afternoon many news stories that take place within this timeframe can only be found in the blogs at the very least the blogs are way ahead of the armenian media on these off days
3110206 one writes about politics another about her female musings and another about knives or automobiles the interests vary one writes because of the lack of real contact the more varied the society the greater the difference in the blogs the more numerous the colors the better

3110227 where we have a government that thinks it has the apparent authority to confiscate children at will as we can see from the recent issues in texas earlier this year something needs to be done
3110228 we are dealing with a fundamental liberty and civil rights issue that has to be recognized and respected by our government the protected right of parenthood

3110331 growth in our defense products during the quarter more than offset declines in sales of our wireless broadband products while we do not expect to repeat last year s second quarter performance which included significant wireless broadband billings based upon ongoing discussions with our customers we believe we are well positioned to participate in the growing need for our products in jamming and in flight data applications we expect to see this participation translate into healthy growth for us over time
3110332 we have achieved considerable measurable progress over the past year to transform the company from one serving disparate industries to one focused on the security industry we noted at the beginning of fy2008 that our key objectives for the year would include strengthening our management team streamlining operations expanding our product line and enhancing distribution efforts we have made noteworthy progress in all areas while we recognize there is still considerable work to be done we believe our corporate reinvention is substantially underway and beginning to show tangible results
3110333 as we orchestrate a wholesale corporate reinvention from a company addressing diverse markets to a high tech company focused on the urgent needs of the homeland security and related markets we felt it was important to bring more relevant security experience on board
3110334 we now have a very talented industry savvy management team we believe our recent sales successes exemplify this and our year over year sales growth demonstrates greater market credibility while sales volumes are expected to fluctuate our growth should continue as we roll out innovative product solutions to address the security needs of our growing customer base
3110335 in late fy2007 we announced our intention to embark upon a plan to exit from our medical and semiconductor businesses since then we successfully concluded the sale of two segments of our medical business a third sale is scheduled to be concluded in the first quarter of fy2009 and we have an informal agreement to sell the remaining medical assets in the second quarter of fy2009 at the same time we have entered into a formal process to sell our semiconductor business we previously announced our goal to be completely divested of our medical and semiconductor businesses by the end of calendar 2008 and at this point we believe we are on track to meet that goal
3110336 we are pleased to report we have more than doubled the number of units of our quantum sniffer products sold year over year
3110337 our technical capabilities should allow us to participate in six key detection areas of the future handheld benchtop package scanners air cargo inspection people in motion and vehicle checkpoints this past fiscal year we have significantly expanded our servable geographies introduced a key new product and made considerable progress on our product roadmap as a result we believe the company is well positioned for continued growth
3110338 there are still challenges ahead of us and we have much to do in order for the company to be successful
3110339 specifically in fy2009 we will continue efforts to expand our security product line improve government reporting performance strengthen our cash position restructure reduce debt complete the divestiture of our medical and semiconductor businesses and continue to leverage relationships and distribution channels to expand customer reach all with the goal of continuing our year over year growth trend we have a clear path ahead and in our judgment the company is doing the right things to achieve sustainable profitability and long term success of course there are many factors that could impact future results but with the team we have and the various technological assets we have in place and under development we are confident in our ability to grow the company and handle future challenges

3110345 by integrating safety functions into their overall automation strategy platform manufacturers can create a safer working environment for employees reduce the risks of an incident that could result in a negative environmental impact and improve manufacturing processes that optimize productivity and key performance indicators such as overall equipment effectiveness which ultimately leads to increased profits
3110346 when manufacturers adopt this holistic approach to safety they are leveraging state of the art technology to help protect their people as well as improving their companys global competitive positioning
3110347 the holistic approach to safety is a best practice that arc hopes even more manufacturers adopt
3110348 manufacturers should challenge their automation suppliers to provide innovative safety solutions and services to support their quests to operate safer while simultaneously increasing productivity and profitability rockwell automation appears to have met this challenge with their integrated safety solution offerings

3110410 the fact that theyre armed and look sinister just makes things worse
3110411 whether or not this is just some ploy to try and force the georgians to give up what are likely pretty well defended and dug in redoubts in the two breakaway regions that theyve controlled for some time or the start of something bigger it is fair to say the war has entered a new phase
3110412 on our side of the pond both presidential candidates have

3110415 hank was the great saxophonist and arranger for ray charles in the 1950s and early 60s and his arrangements and playing were central to me in forming my ideas about what music was and should be
3110416 he had such a wonderful economy in what he did he didnt waste any notes and there was nothing superfluous about his playing
3110417 i consulted a lot of friends ive done a lot of discernment spoken with a lot of women friends i felt in conscience this matter of conscience keeps coming up and i dont know what other word to use if i didnt attend her ordination i would have to stop addressing this issue as i do
3110418 i would have a problem sleeping at night in the future if i didnt put my body where my words are
3110419 i dont know how i could continue to be silent in the church this is such a big issue for me
3110420 over the years and listening to women friends if one listens just shuts up and listens to their stories their faith journey and in some cases their call by god to ordination to the priesthood in the catholic church there is a problem for us guys in the church what are we saying god is calling us but not you this is heresy were tampering with the sacred here
3110421 we cannot justify discrimination no matter how hard the bishops may try in the end it is wrong it is a sin thats how i see it and thats why i am going to be there saturday

3110427 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3110428 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3110429 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3110430 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3110431 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3110432 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3110433 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3110434 is a free form documentary that loosely chronicles the last 12 years of intense change in the east village from the reopening of a newly curfewed tompkins square park to the destruction of the cherished loisaida community gardens to the first yuppie invasions of the dot com years to the present
3110435 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3110436 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3110437 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3110438 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3110439 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3110440 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3110441 the idea that apple can choose what functionality my applications should have frightens me
3110442 a malicious program one that stole users personal data for example to be distributed to iphones through the app store

3110466 this is one of the most exciting fights we could have made in the middleweight division
3110467 bisping has looked a monster since dropping down to 185lbs and hes dominated charles mccarthy and jason day inside a round already this year and leben is coming into ufc 89 with a ton of momentum too having just knocked out terry martin and alessio sakara two of the biggest wins of his career
3110468 that these two guys were willing to fight each other in london with six weeks notice shows you the kind of warriors they are but now we will see this fight probably as it should have always happened with both guys getting plenty of notice and coming in 100 ready for each other
3110469 weve wanted to come to birmingham for a long time and were delighted to finally be bringing the worlds most exciting sport to britains second city in the coming weeks we will be announcing a stacked ufc card for the national indoor arena and i know the midlands are very excited to be able to see bisping v leben live
3110470 i believe i am now showing what i can really do in the ufc dominate opponents and get them out of there inside one round leben will be swinging every second of the fight i know but i dont plan on anything different happening in this fight
3110471 i think me and bisping fighting is the fight everybody wants to see i really do think this is going to be a fight of the year candidate michael bisping is never an easy fight never an easy win and he never has been and its the same with me this is definitely one fight youre gonna want to watch its a challenge for both of us to see who is going to rise to that elite level
3110472 im super excited about fighting in england i dont mind being the bad guy at all so ill go over there represent the united states and get some boos

3110484 all the prayers of his friends and well wishers have been answered
3110485 he has beaten the entire world this is bigger than the world cup

3110558 vandaag gingen we voor goud we moeten scherp zijn en goed varen dat lukte perfect de eerste race
3110559 morgen is een rustdag dan blijven wij uit de zon en doen het rustig aan het is zo zwaar hier we zijn echt moe elke avond we gaan niet op een uitje maar doen wat we moeten doen rusten voor uitjes krijgen we nog alle tijd na de spelen
3110560 ik ben gewend zelf het initiatief te nemen op het water ik vaar altijd mijn eigen race ik ben meestal de wind voor dat kan ik echt goed maar hier lukt dat niet de omstandigheden zijn te onvoorspelbaar ik moet meer volgen die strategie lukte nog niet echt in race vijf maar in race zes lag ik de hele race op een eerste plaats en eindigde als tweede dat voelt als een bevestiging je komt hier toch om te winnen en dat gaat dan totaal niet door ik twijfelde ook niet daar verbaasde ik mezelf ook wel over maar ik bleef er heel rustig onder
3110561 ik was verbaasd over hoe relaxed ik was en ben dat had ik vooraf niet gedacht alles is hetzelfde als andere grote series die we in het verleden gezeild hebben
3110562 we varen vandaag heel stabiel maar morgen kan dat anders zijn het is niet zo eenvoudig om hier elke dag goed te zeilen dat weten we allemaal maar dit is een wel een heel goed begin we zijn wel eens slechter van start gegaan
3110563 de eerste race maakten de dames wel een foutje maar dat herstelden ze goed de tweede race hebben ze briljant gevaren

3110578 from bain the global business consulting firm conducted in coordination with the interactive advertising bureau
3110579 online publishers are producing more inventory than the market demands and risk devaluing the premium nature of their brands particularly in light of ad networks growth and their dramatically lower pricing
3110580 building more effective relationships between publishers and ad networks is critical in the longer term both parties will benefit from gains in ad network cpms
3110581 what this benchmark study tells the industry is that there is a need for more sophisticated yield management on the part of premium publishers for stronger partnerships between publishers and ad networks for development of best practices and more focus on the value of interactive advertising
3110582 our industry is at an important juncture and now is the time for publishers to adopt strategic approaches to the use of ad networks who themselves have become critical players in the digital ecosystem

3110748 the seriousness of the situation is that for tribal policy in india darkness continues to prevail protective laws are rarely implemented budgetary measures like the tribal sub plan strategy have failed to achieve genuine financial devolution and educational strategies have been assimilative and destructive of the moorings of tribal culture light at the end of the tunnel can be seen only in a powerful and radical recent law that provides for self governance by tribal communities however so far the state has forgotten or subverted the interpretation of its own law the perils of the tribal identity and survival remain as real as ever

3110759 and at about 6 25 p m i entered the jail and found the said budhan sabar lying on the floor dead
3110760 i saw the body at 6 18 p m on 17 2 98
3110761 i proceeded on february 17 1998 to district jail purulia at 7 30 p m to inquire into the alleged suicidal death of budhan sabar
3110762 i entered into the district jail at 7 15 p m on february 17 1998
3110763 i proceeded to the district jail purulia at 8 30 p m on 17 2 98 to enquire sic into the alleged suicidal death of budhan sabar
3110764 while i was working in the office on the evening of 14 2 98 i was informed that budhan committed suicide in cell
3110765 in connection with barabazar police station case no 37 97 dated 15 9 97
3110766 budhan disclosed startling facts in connection with case no 37 97 dated 5 9 97
3110767 they were several other contradictions and inconsistencies in the affidavits
3110768 t here is no credible evidence of the alleged suicide of budhan
3110769 every well documented case of a great creative indian personality abounds in evidence of such contacts with the non rational culture of excluded peoples and classes
3110770 thirty years ago we had hundreds of cattle there was enough manure to cultivate as much as we needed only after all the land has gone do we understand the value of it we used to hunt every week we were good archers now we sit at home even for uchchar our biggest hunting festival we used to make a kutty bow even for the tiniest baby in the village he had to hold this for uchchar when we had land life was better now everyone has more money because they work as labourers but that cannot last you till you die its only for the able bodied only as long as you can go for work
3110771 brings illnesses for us whatever we get from the land is enough our people were never greedy we could have claimed the entire hillside where we live we didnt now were hemmed in by outsiders
3110772 we say whatever we get is enough but our non tribal neighbours say whatever they get is not enough
3110773 but for me my village is enough germany was nice but it is like a dream when you wake up after a dream you remember the nice parts but you do not expect to get all that you saw in the dream what use is money i know people who have gone to dubai and come back rich but a man must live among his people his community his gods if i cannot see these hills these paddy fields hear our adivasi children laugh hear our music and dance for our festivals i would pine grow sick and die
3110774 my father and the old people used to talk about the importance of preserving our culture etc but for me these were only words when we went to germany thousands of people were willing to listen to our stories our music to come and watch our dancing i realised the importance of sharing which we take for granted in our adivasi society people there who had lost their sense of community and sharing envied us only then i realised how all this could slip away if we dont hold on to it leaving home made us value our simple life much more
3110775 my husband is very supportive and a good man but he got into drinking it is something i wouldnt tolerate we had decided in the sangam to fight alcohol i warned him a couple of times one saturday night he turned up drunk again i locked the door and told him you can stay out all night you wont enter this house drunk again it was a hard decision because it was the monsoon he begged me ill get ill how can you be so heartless but i steeled myself and let him be that was the last time he came home drunk
3110776 what kind of government will hike the price of rice and kerosene and cut the price of cell phones and i thought the bjp would be better
3110777 youve seen the old and new ways what do you think of the changes in everyones lifestyle
3110778 there are new differences emerging earlier every family in the village was more or less the same now if i decide to bring my child up traditionally i know in my mind that its the best decision but my neighbour sends his child for computer classes what chance has my child got with farming and hunting in todays world when he grows up wont he curse me for not educating him like the others
3110779 in the old days if a woman had ten children everyone looked at her with awe and said thats some strong woman shes borne ten children our children were our wealth now they would look with pity and say devamme my god ten children poor thing she must be some stupid ignorant woman earlier our children the stock of paddy our cattle were the signs of wealth now it is only money
3110780 when someone dies we question the gods for us gods and people are equal
3110781 we dont worship our gods that is the difference we ask their advice their help but we scream and curse them when someone is ill or dies
3110782 that our gods live with us in our villages and among our people so we dont have to go to find them in any mosque temple or church religion the fuss about conversion being hindu muslim or christian is difficult to understand for us the gods are important not the religion
3110783 at first we thought it was a hospital they told us no they live there why we asked do they not have children yes but their children cannot take care of them we could not believe it this kind of progressive wealthy society we could not comprehend we decided no matter how wealthy or advanced we become we must never let such a thing happen to our old people to our adivasi society
3110784 there is no one here we can talk to our words are getting stuck in our throats
3110785 do you know what this reminds me of i saw a picture of kylie minogue the other day where she looked about twice her size
3110786 i mean i know she must be like six stone in real life but she just looked much chubbier
3110787 it must just have been taken at a bad angle
3110788 i dont know if this changes us it might limit us a little more just because we felt ben had a little better grasp of the offense
3110789 time will tell were not sure who the guy will be
3110790 i think its easier for us to slide craft in there because hes a little older but he has to prove himself
3110791 osaar and chris forcier will be right in the mix to be able to say no im the best prospect part of that is leadership and part of that is knowing what youre doing theres a lot of moxie that goes into being a quarterback and that doesnt show up on the stat sheet
3110792 being patient and by not going in the tank its a great story of understanding that this may not be your time because the coaches have to make decisions but when your time shows up again instead of wasting time by going in the tank you stayed positive and stayed ready
3110793 and for the most part youd never know you were underground except for the enormous stone pillars that hold up the roof

3110826 liner notes who even writes those anymore i cant tell you how disappointed i have been in those for the past decade
3110827 in the first few years of the 1970s he single handedly redefined the sonic possibilities for black music in the process opening up the album market as a commercially viable medium for black artists such as marvin gaye stevie wonder funkadelic and curtis mayfield
3110828 people stared and pointed but i liked the breeze on my head it felt great
3110829 these people love you man theyll follow you anywhere youre like moses black moses
3110830 didnt say im the black moses of the black world they said of the music world
3110831 music is universal but sometimes presentation will restrict you or limit your range
3110832 glen campbell and jim webb were targeting the pop audience but when i did it i aimed to the black market but it was so big it went all over
3110833 one of the reasons you dont know my name is six minutes and six seconds is because of mr isaac hayes
3110834 hes really changed the face of music in so many ways the way he just kind of extended songs to the point where they would be strings for three minutes before the song even began
3110835 i used to dream just dream about being able to have a warm bed to sleep in and a nice square meal and some decent clothes to wear
3110836 i said sure even though the extent of my musical knowledge was chopsticks and heart and soul

3110851 see i heard ya first album was called infinite i shook my head cause nowadays you soundin different
3110852 its better not to hold such forums in the future
3110853 if you checked out google wannabe cuil you learned that
3110854 our counter thrust must be to prick holes in the stiff front erected by the russians leaders
3110855 thanks to the google maps graphic accompanying a story about russian incursions into georgia the nation state in the caucasus not the caucasian pride ridden state in the southern u
3110856 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for the end of the russian bombings
3110857 if we allow ourselves to do that the world will end up on a slippery slope toward an endless series of military conflicts we cannot allow that to happen
3110858 unfortunately since we have taken iraq unilaterally russia is free to take georgia unilaterally and any other province they can get away with
3110859 there were several attacks on georgia but strictly on military targets
3110860 im also sure that georgians keep their tanks in the apartment buildings since ive seen some of them bombed by russian planes
3110861 in order to fetch all families that wish to come back
3110862 i had a guy shoot a gun next to me thats how bad it was
3110863 i thought i would see this only on tv never in real life
3110864 its too early to say what happened exactly were talking about the death of a man its a major investigation
3110865 we only know what we see in the news in the newspapers thats all
3110866 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
3110867 well maybe after 9 11 but as soon as that happened we were expecting a rush this came totally out of the blue its scary
3110868 they say on the tv that this has nothing to do with us but you just cant trust those russians
3110869 i remember when they invaded colorado in the eighties those reds theyre good for nothing you cant trust them no further than you can throw them
3110870 we have to be alert and aware at all times and our forces are ready to act at a moments notice i have the national guard on speed dial i can tell you i very nearly made that call today
3110871 cnn monitors all news stories we become aware of and report according to what we deem as relevant we have all the information anyone could need on the situation in georgia the country of georgia that is cnn is the world news leader
3110872 we were overwhelmed with calls for a while there and we are still getting a few said official drew ossington
3110873 we did contact washington and from what we were told the president was informed of the situation
3110874 i think its important for people to remain aware and alert
3110875 fear is a good thing it keeps us on edge and ready for anything this may have been a false alarm but the next one might not be im very happy that our residents are so proactive
3110876 turning rap into sport ive mastered the part cause the trash on the chart leave you gaspin for art
3110877 we used to be concerned at the division or national levels now it has even reached the branches if it goes unchecked umno may suffer dire consequences and may disintegrate
3110878 this denigration of modernity in favor of divinity and mythos also suggests a false totality
3110879 divide up all mlb history by presidential administrations find the ballplayer from that era who is most similar to the president and explain the comparisons the downside is that it runs the risk of becoming political the point of this is to be fun not to get people caught up in some damn debate still i want to get the guys who i think are good comps
3110880 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee

3110890 it would be terrific to have an article from senator mccain that mirrors senator obamas piece
3110891 found that 49 of voters believe most reporters will try to help obama with their coverage up from 44 a month ago
3110892 plurality of democrats 37 say most reporters try to offer unbiased coverage of the campaign twenty seven percent 27 believe most reporters are trying to help obama and 21 in obamas party think reporters are trying to help mccain
3110893 50 see a pro obama bias and 21 see unbiased coverage just 12 of those not affiliated with either major party believe the reporters are trying to help mccain
3110894 people of berlin people of the world this is our moment this is our time
3110895 this initiative will better protect communities and provide an additional tool for the correctional service of canada and police to prevent crime our government is determined to ensure that those offenders who are released by the national parole board into the community are more effectively monitored
3110896 we have listened to police and victims groups who have been requesting such a tool for years compelling offenders to abide by the conditions of their release is a key aspect of our reform of canadas prison system
3110897 in 2006 nova scotia became the first province in the country to use gps technology to monitor offenders
3110898 we are pleased to share the knowledge and expertise we have gained over the past two years with the government of canada
3110899 i am very pleased with the governments announcement enhanced supervision through electronic monitoring will provide victims and the public greater protection
3110900 queen and prince charles have drawn up a secret two year intensive training programme which he will start when he quits military life in the new year
3110901 those who want to hear obama live have been told to start arriving three hours earlier berlin authorities say that as many as a million people could attend four tv stations are broadcasting the entire speech and the rest are scrambling to secure prime locations at the site
3110902 more than the deaths of people in my own family
3110903 despite talk in the german media that the speech today would draw a crowd of up to one million it was more like tens of thousands a massive crowd regardless that came to hear the presumptive democratic nominee a local band warmed the crowd up for over an hour before the much anticipated speech
3110904 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3110905 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3110906 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future
3110907 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication

3110930 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3110931 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

3110937 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3110938 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3110939 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3110940 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3110941 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3110942 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3110943 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3110944 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3110945 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3110946 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3110947 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3110948 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3110949 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3110950 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3110951 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3110952 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3110953 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3110954 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3110955 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3110956 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3110957 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3110958 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3110959 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3110960 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3110961 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3110962 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3110963 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3110964 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3110965 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3110966 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3110967 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3110968 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3110969 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3110970 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3110971 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3110972 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3110973 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3110974 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3110975 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3110976 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3110977 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3110978 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3110979 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3110980 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3110981 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3110982 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3110983 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3110984 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3110985 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3110986 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3110987 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3110988 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3110989 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3110990 the college isnt even allowed to have budget deficits under state law
3110991 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3110992 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3110993 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3110994 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3110995 its a huge hit in britain and now for the first time ever well film the show with american dogs

3110998 the georgian army is retreating to defend the capital the government is urgently seeking international intervention to prevent the fall of georgia and the further loss of life
3110999 russia seems intent on overthrowing the democratically elected government of georgia and occupying the country
3111000 they are on the central highway which links the east and west of georgia this is the situation people are leaving their villages
3111001 its a very bad situation people are in panic nobody knows what to do this road where the troops are is about 2kms from the city centre its very near the road is closed now
3111002 this is an occupation half of georgia is under russian control our aim now is to to build up our troops and to create a defensive line in front of tbilisi we will fight defending tbilisi
3111003 the idea is to punish georgia and the georgian government and misha saakashvili they hate misha

3111021 men of ephesus who is there who does not know that the city of the ephesians is temple keeper of the great artemis and of the sacred stone that fell from the sky 36 seeing then that these things cannot be denied you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash 37 for you have brought these men here who are neither sacrilegious nor blasphemers of our goddess 38 if therefore demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone the courts are open and there are proconsuls let them bring charges against one another 39 but if you seek anything further it shall be settled in the regular assembly 40 for we really are in danger of being charged with rioting today since there is no cause that we can give to justify this commotion

3111141 this release of mediamonkey is a major upgrade over previous versions
3111142 in addition to supporting the needs of serious collectors version 3 0 is also slicker more user friendly syncs with more devices adds podcasting and album art browsing and will appeal to almost anyone who feels that itunes or windows media player is too simple to meet their music management needs
3111143 our users told us that they wanted a music manager that can scale to 100 000 tracks so we designed mediamonkey 3 0 for scalability from the ground up
3111144 to support such large collections version 3 adds automated library management for bookkeeping functions such as volume analysis and file naming it also allows users to segment large collections into sub collections such as classical music or contemporary music each configured with custom views and playback rules for example a classical music collection can be configured to display conductor and play with cross fading disabled
3111145 our buyers are serious audiophiles with large music collections in lossless audio formats such as flac
3111146 mediamonkey is the best music manager for our users it supports all of the high end features they require without requiring them to be technically advanced
3111147 el cierre de las mesas fue bueno y en t rminos generales se cubri la expectativa de los 400 mil participantes fue un ejercicio exitoso
3111148 no pudimos conocer la lista de funcionarios de casillas ni validar el proceso de capacitaci n que debieron seguir salvo el caso de dos grupos con 50 personas no tuvimos ocasi n de cotejar el material electoral que se adquiri localmente o el que se recibi de la organizaci n nacional tampoco pudimos conocer la manera en que se integraron y se distribuyeron los paquetes el n mero y la calidad de las boletas debidamente foliadas el control de las formas para las actas la dotaci n suficiente de aplicadores de tinta indeleble y la eficacia de sta asimismo no pudimos incidir en la manera de concentrar y manejar la informaci n sobre los resultados parciales
3111149 el ejercicio democr tico fue todo un xito y creemos que el resultado final arrojar una participaci n de 150 mil personas muy superior a las 100 mil que esper bamos
3111150 with visual studio 2008 service pack 1 you can now connect directly to sql server 2008 and you can develop against that
3111151 you can take the data in your app and turn it into a rest service without having to write any plumbing
3111152 were making it significantly easier for developers to deploy their apps and to make a kind of a great application deployment experience on the desktop
3111153 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
3111154 our competitors are huge but theyre also weighed down by proprietary technologies and audio formats
3111155 itunes is closely aligned with the aac fairplay format and works really well with the ipod but doesnt work with other devices and lossless formats such as flac windows media player uses wma and works well with plays for sure devices but doesnt synch with ipods these types of issues have driven users to the open mp3 format and to mediamonkey
3111156 a proprietary solution is almost always the right solution because it allows you to knit all the pieces together in an optimized way
3111157 mediamonkey has developed a reputation as one of the best music managers and one of our goals in this release was to improve some of its non management features weve added party mode so that it can be used in public places without worrying about alterations to the library and auto dj so that tracks can be set to play automatically even when a playlist runs out
3111158 in addition to making sure that mediamonkey has the best ipod support possible weve also added mp3 data cd dvd burning since a growing percentage of car stereos now include mp3 cd playback
3111159 with a single click users can burn a cd that is navigable via their car stereo
3111160 if youre tired of using one program to organize your music another to level the volume and yet another to play it if youre sick of the adware and the bloatware then mediamonkey is what youre looking for
3111161 what makes mediamonkey different from most other players is that we dont have any vested interest in a particular music service or format
3111162 real player works with the rhapsody service microsoft media player is geared primarily for wma files apples itunes only supports the itunes store thats like having a web browser that can used to purchase books only from barnes amp where players are at today mediamonkey will be format and service agnostic
3111163 most consumers obtain their digital music files from multiple sources their own cd collections online music services and their friends all of these files will be encoded and formatted differently and most serious collectors will want a single application to organize them level the volume add lyrics export them to other devices and play them no matter where they come from our mission is to build the best music manager possible and let other companies worry about building online music stores
3111164 to date each of the online music services has required its users to install a custom client musicmatch jukebox for the musicmatch service real player for the rhapsody service and so on thats like amazon forcing you to use an amazon browser in order to shop at amazon even if you prefer the mozilla browser
3111165 we believe most consumers want choice choice of software choice of format choice of purchase venue were building a product that aims to satisfy users regardless of formats and services used
3111166 for those of us who cant afford an ipod mediamonkey now offers the rest of us a similar synchronization experience it will now synchronize tracks and playlists to almost any portable audio device that is a usb mass storage device if you can copy files to it in the windows explorer itll synch with mediamonkey
3111167 whereas a large segment of the online music world is developing online music services that are compatible with a particular client and a particular portable audio device mediamonkeys philosophy is to be able to support any online service with any audio format using any portable audio device
3111168 we continue to believe that most consumers want choice choice of software choice of format and choice of portable device were building a product that aims to satisfy these needs while giving online music stores a tool that they can customize to their liking
3111169 i just need to reinterpret everybody more and i will still find some movement for
3111170 you know the thing that you and your coworkers said would go up 25 a year and never have a problem selling
3111171 so you cannot afford seattle but houston is in your price range which is it
3111172 houstons boom was set off in part by the skyrocketing prices for oil and gas which are the citys central commodities
3111173 a major difference between seattle and austin is the price of land and building costs seattle has almost no land left to develop
3111174 i get tired of people that only consider the city boundary of seattle to be seattle
3111175 i would say the only thing that is stopping us from moving now is that i dont think we could sell our house right now even if we sold it at the price we paid for it 5 1 2 years ago 300k
3111176 after awhile housing became dirt cheap and soon people moved to seattle and our little company recovered see this is what is called an economic cycle
3111177 its not much different than purchasers of belltown real estate who are in denial about how incredibly dangerous of an area they chose to live facing up to reality is often painful especially when money spent foolishly is involved

3111185 aside from the challenge to develop an innovative title with spectacular levels and new controls the focus in cursed mountain is the overwhelming environment of the himalayas
3111186 it is really important to us that the player experiences natures powers as realistically as possible and that the games viewing distance allows the player to see the monumental landscapes at all times we are also going to great lengths to make the dead souls look as convincing as possible in order to deliver the level of immersion necessary for really effective and believable survival horror

3111203 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3111204 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3111205 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3111206 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3111207 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3111208 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3111209 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3111210 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3111215 the return of exiles is a victory for every iraqi patriot
3111216 the return of exiled families represents the defeat of sectarian plans
3111217 i left iraq because the situation was very bad and we did not know if tomorrow we would still be alive
3111218 my parents told me that the situation had changed and my family encouraged me to return thats why im here
3111219 enter into immediate talks about resolving the investigation as that would be in the best interests of both consumers nationwide as well as wachovia customers

3111225 mate ive been living with that other blokes name for years it doesnt worry me at all he told australias
3111226 he likes to be known for his talent not his name

3111231 i did have hepatitis but it was alcoholic hepatitis and that was 17 years ago i was in very bad shape i wouldnt advise anyone to drink that much
3111232 but i was treated for it and it has now cleared up i only stayed off the drink for three weeks
3111233 i think the reason im still here is because i have a strong constitution i dont feel 50 i feel younger every day
3111234 look at prince william and harry im always reading about prince harry hes getting drunk hes kissing girls hes falling out of nightclubs at five oclock in the morning
3111235 well so hes doing the same thing as every other 22 or 23 year old out there but he cant because hes not a normal human being hes a demi god because hes a royal
3111236 somebody asked me one time what my sexual fantasy would be and under the guise of sounding crazy i said it would be having sex in a car but that seemed kind of conservative to me afterwards
3111237 we are all descendents of royalty and if we carry ourselves and respect ourselves in that manner and believe in ourselves then we are all kings
3111238 it has nothing to do with being arrogant i am king is not a statement about myself i am king is about every man who is going to go and buy the fragrance
3111239 i would love to design one day i do not have the time right now but i would love to develop a home line or a clothing line so we will see what comes first

3111250 where do i position my subject left right or in the middle
3111251 cancer is scary and lonely you cant ask anyone to make decisions for you because its just too heavy
3111252 there is a lot of rush to treatment when what you really need is time to research and think about how you want to approach this take your time christina there is no rush take your time and think it through

3111254 its either i give you a ride home or i carry one of your bags to the bus stop and were quite away from burbank pumpkin and you know that im going to borrow that tank top either way
3111255 id like to think ive made some people pause reflect and reconsider ideas and assumptions they held as true but it would be na ve to think that everyone who clicked on to the page now thinks differently
3111256 look different dress differently worship in a different way and live in the same community as them
3111257 if it resulted in a smile to a stranger or a knock introducing yourself to your neighbor then id be very proud
3111258 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
3111259 you dont think about checking that stuff every time you go to a web site
3111260 if you go to a site with this toolbar you will know whether its vulnerable
3111261 we have a lot of big plans for mass effect having a ds version would be an awesome way to keep interest alive and keep it going in addition to the next one mass effect 2

3111264 international aviation and the global environment how icao has made climate change a priority issue
3111265 we need an all purpose building to serve the same things that it did for 55 or 60 years in our community
3111266 we feel without that our history is being cut short
3111267 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
3111268 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
3111269 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
3111270 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
3111271 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community
3111272 its an even harder sell when you tear it down and dont replace it with exactly what it once was
3111273 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for
3111274 i think having similar buildings within 100 yards of each other is not good business on behalf of the city but im going to talk to our folks talk to city commissioners and meet with lynn ray and see if we cant get something that will make them happy
3111275 i would hate to think it was a black and white issue because this new sanders center is going to be open to the entire city of texas city
3111276 and so im grateful to call him a friend and a colleague and im looking forward to a lengthy collaboration in terms of making sure that detroit does well in the future

3111281 the path of freedom you have chosen is not easy but you will not travel it alone americans respect your courageous choice for liberty and as you build a free and democratic georgia the american people will stand with you
3111282 hes f ing awesome at this point id have to say no
3111283 we just have to make sure its the right guy karmically we deserve the right guy its a tough thing man we make a pretty big noise
3111284 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3111285 that will be the start of a nationwide protest we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film
3111286 tropic thunder is an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3111287 i think thats whats lovely but also sad about acting you get incredibly close to people and as soon as its over you dont see each other youre away from home its a very intense relationship and then its not anymore
3111288 i dont think im very good at figuring out female friendships i think theyre quite tricky to navigate i have a lot of friends who are guys and i find that manipulation and jealousy dont come into it as much whereas those things can happen easily between women
3111289 we are right now driving through the town and i see no trace of troops or military vehicles it is absolutely deserted
3111290 i dont know if there will be a text ready by the time the council meets this afternoon
3111291 we are carefully watching how western media is covering the events
3111292 it is very unusual that the financial times has stepped aside from its usual balanced reporting over the past few days
3111293 most of the western press supports georgia in the conflict and accuses russia of trying to annex foreign territory
3111294 the west is kind of spreading propaganda against russia this is not a case of russia being overly aggressive
3111295 if journalists have already discovered who the guilty parties are then public opinion is not nearly so straightforward
3111296 it is as clear as day that the u s is supporting georgia and propping them up both with money and on tv they the united states are blaming russia for something we did not do
3111297 objectivity is not a typical trait of some western journalists
3111298 saakashvili was put there by the americans by american money he is being paid by the americans and america is funding this conflict
3111299 is it any surprise to you that they the west do not like us
3111300 best was honored for her outstanding advocacy in the trial of steve feuersteins claim against the city of billings
3111301 have demonstrated selflessness integrity bravery or remarkable character in vindicating the rights of all montanans to protection from wrongful injury compensation according to fault honesty and accountability in government
3111302 i think a lot of people around the state thought that about him
3111303 he just knew he had to do the right thing our civil justice system is at its best when it challenges the powerful and thats what he did
3111304 the slope was not a real steep slope but he was not able to stop his sliding before he went over the edge and took the fall
3111305 our rangers have told me that the snowcover is significant still and its pretty sloppy because of warming temperatures
3111306 it gets pretty soft and slushy and can give easily
3111307 its gonna be a tough matchup no matter how it goes
3111308 they might have a bonfire and burn some of t boones money to get ready for the game
3111309 houston nutt will honor the scholarship because hes not evil bravo for him
3111310 but there are things that bring good colors here in alaska
3111311 i love going up in the mountains in september here to see the yellows of the willows and the orange of the blueberries and the red of the bearberries and the purpley fireweed
3111312 one of the things that is really critical is cool nights
3111313 starting in september if it starts to get cool but not below freezing if you have clear cool days and cool nights it stimulates fall color
3111314 its all a pattern but its never the same which is whats really cool about it
3111315 fall will begin mid august and it will be peaking there the end of august and first week of september
3111316 and then all of a sudden those bright colors are gone and youre into winter pretty quickly
3111317 we have a more temperate climate the fall colors kick in about the third week of september and into the first week of october
3111318 are always the first to sell out the high demand for the last part of august is because of the fall colors
3111319 near the coast is the last place youll find color
3111320 from mid september to late october we see a variation of fall color rolling through from the western upper peninsula to the southeastern portion of the state
3111321 the lakes tend to pop toward the last moment mid to late october
3111322 that makes it look like evening in the middle of the day
3111323 its not uncommon to see trees turning colors sometimes even later than the first week of november
3111324 in the fall the leaves of the tree turn beautiful shades of pink and magenta
3111325 coming in and out of yosemite either on highway 41 from the south or highway 120 from the northwest there are a lot of dogwood trees right next to the highway
3111326 it is with deep regret that the stafford motor speedway announced that during a practice session rider anthony hart age 21 of henderson nev succumbed to injuries received while participating in the event
3111327 the speedway extends their condolences to the family and friends of anthony hart
3111328 theres no question that americans are desperately looking for change and new ways to conduct business in this country they want a new direction they want to know that their government has not forgotten them and their lives we felt that the democratic convention was a great way to kick off the momentum for change
3111329 we were not satisfied with the way he led the negotiations especially in the final stage
3111330 the way waszczykowski negotiated his hard unequivocal view on the issue did not fully reflect my own views
3111331 select datepart yyyy data as ano datepart m data as mes from tabela group by datepart yyyy data datepart m data
3111332 any one of us could have made that shot any time
3111333 of course i was very tense i was under pressure and i was nervous but thats part of the game
3111334 when we were training for the olympics in korea we recreated these kind of situations
3111335 we had our sixth ton of ice delivered july 31
3111336 they expect to do 40 to 50 mris while they are here at camp
3111337 the proximity to st marys was one of the reasons they picked concordia when they were in macomb ill they had to send players back to st louis if they needed one
3111338 we bought cattle troughs at farm fleet in germantown that they fill with ice to cool down the players
3111339 mr putin had tried for years to prevent kosovo from declaring its independence from serbia and when the kosovars went ahead with strong american and european support last february mr putin responded by leveling a blow at americas caucasus darling soon afterward the russian duma held hearings on recognition of abkhazia south ossetia and transnistria a pro russian breakaway republic in moldova moscow argued that the wests logic on kosovo should apply as well to these ethnic communities seeking to free themselves from the control of a hostile state

3111350 we have very loyal customers and were always trying to find a new way to engage them
3111351 i suspect that type of product will be for customers that have their laptops with them so theyll most likely be able to download their music from there
3111352 but this is part of the test one of things well take a look at is what products consumers have a lot of appetite for if it turns out that this type of device isnt highly needed well adjust our assortment accordingly
3111353 best buy is nearing the saturation point in terms of big box stores
3111354 this is just one more way to reach the customer
3111355 i dont think it will drive enough revenue at least in the first year to have a material effect on the bottom line
3111356 well have to wait and see i dont think its overly capital intensive so they should be able to manage the cost structure of that business fairly well
3111357 i dream dreams but even if they dont come true i would be better off for having dreamt them
3111358 of what is the stencil on one of the tables in castros
3111359 the chairs that under previous management were upholstered in leather have been replaced by spindly ones that suggest a suburban country club and a hand resting on any given table would easily notice the wooden surface below unshielded by the felt that often adds a bit of invisible luxury to high end restaurants
3111360 i am not issuing a blanket excuse for infidelity which i really do believe is one of the most painful things that one human being can do to another
3111361 actually im going to have to take strong issue with your statement that infidelity is one of the most painful things one human being can do to another really murder rape economic exploitation in my view the real violence is in the social order that demands a monogymous nuclear family persecutes people who dont fulfill that role and demands that we all subscribe to some crackpot theory about true everlasting love what a load of horse manure why would any sane person want any of that
3111362 its not that big of a deal because everyone does it and furthermore the rules that were broken were unfair in the first place
3111363 so the new season is upon us at last or already depending on your point of view i for one am delighted last time out manchester united won their first and last games on penalties winning the community shield in
3111364 its now 30 years since fresh from winning the world cup osvaldo ardiles and ricardo villa left argentina and touched down at white hart lane tottenhams coup was years ahead of its time just a few months later paul weller
3111365 wembley stadium sir alex ferguson was in relaxed mood as relaxed as a manager should be with the premier league and the champions league in his trophy cabinet and with the cosmetic glory of the community shield added to
3111366 should britney spears perform at this years video music awards
3111367 i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free

3111374 on all significant issues i supported the president 90 of the time
3111375 the lobbyists running his low road campaign the money billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies but almost nothing for families like yours lurching to the right then the left the old washington dance whatever it takes john mccain a washington celebrity playing the same old washington games
3111376 they poked us and stabbed us with the machetes and they were asking for money specifically dollars
3111377 we had a few quetzales guatemalas currency but we had no dollars with us on the boat
3111378 i said we need help i said my husband was not moving
3111379 they were real trusting and loving and outright but they were aware that stuff happens this is just a freak thing
3111380 they were really getting into the arts and crafts of guatemala
3111381 the only thing more dangerous than being americas enemy is being americas ally
3111382 criticism may not be agreeable but it is necessary it fulfils the same function as pain in the human body it calls attention to an unhealthy state of things
3111383 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
3111384 2 the iraqis whom we armed and trained to fight the iranians whom we armed with chemical weapons
3111385 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
3111386 why were our soldiers in kosovo and iraq if we dont get any help from the west now

3111395 oh god no no i just cant bear to look downfield promise not to tell me how this pass turns out okay
3111396 dude just relax theyre probably not going to put in hackney for another two interceptions
3111397 in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judea 2 and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand 3 for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet esaias saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight
3111398 i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman 2 every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit
3111399 abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me 5 i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing 6 if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned 7 if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you
3111400 if you abide in me and my words abide in you
3111401 when you really want something all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it

3111409 restoring our constitution specifically protecting the civil rights of suspected terrorists and of targeted ethnic groups
3111410 a strong belief that education is the rock on which a civilized society is built
3111411 driving onto the tarmac with secret service to drop off barack at his place was pretty awesome
3111412 the freer the society then the greater will be the variety and the diversity among men for the more fully developed will be every mans uniquely individual personality
3111413 the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market
3111414 no one can fully develop his powers in any direction without engaging in specialization
3111415 no social life could have arisen among men of equal natural capacity in a world which was geographically uniform
3111416 karl marx was vague and cloudy in describing the communist ideal let alone the specific path for attaining it but one essential feature is the eradication of the division of labor
3111417 after the enslaving subordination of individuals under division of labor and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor has vanished
3111418 friedrich engels maintained that the emergence of the division of labor shattered the alleged classless harmony and uniformity of primitive society and was responsible for the cleavage of society into separate and conflicting classes
3111419 each individual the opportunity to develop and exercise all his faculties physical and mental in all directions
3111420 the division of labour among people to educate and school people give them
3111421 will possess scientists and artists of all kinds in countless numbers
3111422 a new type of man will arise a superman an exalted man
3111423 of course the only way to resolve this dilemma is to fantasize that the new communist man will be a superman
3111424 our dehumanized factories our unsatisfied senses our estrangement from nature
3111425 man sought open spaces the possibility of moving about of not constantly colliding with other people
3111426 part of this primitivism reflects a hatred for the intellect and its works since the flowering of reason and intellection leads to diversity and inequality of individual achievement
3111427 for them the man of the past who developed his powers harmoniously is the ideal an ideal which alas no longer inspires our degenerate age
3111428 when the local food supply within an area is depleted the
3111429 fearing that they may disclose the size of their accounts to members of their families they therefore prefer to keep their savings under the fireplace or buried in the ground

3111432 the mass does not wish to share life with those who are not of it it has a deadly hatred of all that is not itself
3111433 it is curious in fact that those romantics who yearn to restore the mythical golden age of caste and status refuse to allow each individual the freedom to choose between market on the one hand or caste and tribal commune on the other invariably the new golden age has to be imposed by coercion
3111434 free and equal phrase in the declaration of independence was an unfortunate paraphrase of a better statement contained in the virginia bill of rights all men are by nature equally free and independent in other words men can be
3111435 it is high time then for those who cherish freedom individuality the division of labor and economic prosperity and survival to stop conceding the supposed nobility of the ideal of equality
3111436 it is ironic that the term equality brings its favorable connotation to us from a past usage that was radically different only the specific of equality of liberty the older view of human equality is compatible with the basic nature of man equality of condition would reduce humanity to an antheap existence
3111437 in every organized activity no matter the sphere a small number will become the oligarchical leaders and the others will follow
3111438 in a free society everyone will be equal only in liberty while diverse and unequal in all other respects
3111439 the widening of the range of alternatives open to people as consumers and as producers

3111441 a short weekend on a farm might have convinced marx that the cattle themselves might have some objection to being reared in this casual manner in the evening
3111442 a lack of teachers and of technical training has hampered industrial development and production in recent years
3111443 workers appear often to have been not tempered but softened by their exposure to a more sedentary life as many students rather than finding life on the farm rewarding fled china or killed themselves
3111444 personal interest is the moving force of our social development the objectivity of the category of personal interest lies in the fact that yugoslavia socialism cannot subject the personal happiness of man to any ulterior goals or higher aims for the highest aims of socialism is the personal happiness of man

3111452 neck and neck race between 2007 and this year over the issue of ice loss
3111453 we thought arctic ice cover might recover after last years unprecedented melting and indeed the picture didnt look too bad last month
3111454 and it now looks as if it will be a very close call indeed whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for ice cover over the arctic
3111455 weve never seen any kind of opening like this in history
3111456 it is not only record setting its unprecedented it doesnt resemble anything that weve observed before
3111457 it takes less solar energy to dissipate and melt that ice
3111458 so we potentially could reach a new minimum time will tell if we are going to be approaching the 2007 sea ice retreat there still five weeks of melting to go
3111459 could soon result in an ice free north pole during summer

3111478 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3111479 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3111480 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3111481 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3111482 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3111483 theres no question that americans are desperately looking for change and new ways to conduct business in this country they want a new direction they want to know that their government has not forgotten them and their lives we felt that the democratic convention was a great way to kick off the momentum for change

3111488 when i first performed phoenix i was at a predominantly black club and i knew they didnt want to hear any glen campbell
3111489 i had to bring it to a level they could understand the club was packed and everybody was talking no one was listening so i tell the band the mar keys to hang on to this chord and i started doing this rap over it about what happened to the couple in the song that led to their breakup pretty soon the club is silent and people are listening to every word by the end of the song some of them are crying

3111496 despite being instructed to cease and desist jonestm continued to unlawfully distribute esntion music and videos
3111497 every time jonestm has illegally sold esntion music and videos it has taken money and profits from our company money im not able to pay artists songwriters and publishing companies

3111499 with respect to those songs for which we seek statutory damages we intend to further show that jonestms activities were willful and will seek additional damages for willfully infringing upon esntions copyrighted music recordings

3111514 were delighted that americas largest african american owned radio network company has joined with us to educate voters protect our vote and turn out the black community in record numbers in this historic election
3111515 ncbcp has a long history of making sure people participate in a process that our ancestors died for as a radio network reaching 20 million african americans weekly were pleased to join hands with them to insure people participate in this most basic and fundamental right
3111516 this is critical information that every voter should know before they cast a ballot
3111517 thats why were so excited about our partnership with aurn we know that the way to send a message to the black world is through radio and aurn is our conduit to over 20 million potential voters
3111518 faas claim that it can use its property management authority to auction slots is intellectually dishonest and a disturbing end run around congress
3111519 every transportation administration except this one has acknowledged that it does not have the authority to implement auctions and other so called market mechanisms
3111520 we said that we would challenge the faa decision in a court of law and we are doing just that today we have started the process to protect our members rights
3111521 should be held unlawful and set aside because these actions are in excess of the faas statutory authority constitute unauthorized regulatory action disguised as property management are contrary to express statutory limitations imposed by congress in the 2008 consolidated appropriations act are without observance of procedure required by law and are arbitrary capricious an abuse of discretion and otherwise not in accordance with law
3111522 faas plan is not only unlawful it is both surprising and perplexing it is surprising because the end result will be more flights during the busiest times of the day at newark even as we suffer through yet another delay plagued summer and it is perplexing because the announced slot auction precedes formal rules to auction slots at newark and other airports
3111523 sadly faa believes that it has the right to make up the rules as it goes along faa should focus its efforts on fulfilling its responsibility to provide the infrastructure and air traffic resources necessary to meet the publics demand for safe air transportation services instead of finding new ways to inhibit economic growth and further tax an already overtaxed traveling public
3111524 it is exciting to be working with disney channels the cheetah girls

3111528 were monitoring the safety of the hpv vaccine very carefully and the only adverse event that causes some concern is fainting after the vaccine
3111529 higher rates of guillain barr have been associated with the swine flu vaccine and possibly with the meningitis vaccine menactra but it is no more common in those who get gardasil than in those who dont
3111530 given all the questions about gardasil the best public health policy would be to reevaluate its safety and to prohibit its distribution to minors in the least governments should rethink any efforts to mandate or promote this vaccine for children
3111531 in 90 of cases your bodys immune system clears the hpv infection naturally within two years
3111532 in the last decade these factors have accounted for virtually 100 of californias population growth
3111533 if we want to start healing our environment weve got to slow population growth more people mean more cars more sprawl higher energy demands more air pollution more demand for water and more paved over farmland
3111534 with americas population growing at its current rate every time we make an environmental gain our population increases and the gains are erased reducing immigration is the key to slowing future population growth and recapturing the momentum in the battle to save californias natural treasures its time for california to lead the rest of the country on this issue

3111545 the chesapeake bay and the san joaquin valley are bellwethers for an environment that is challenged and requires a solution to the environmental impacts of land application of livestock manure as the trend to require reductions of nutrients entering our waterways continues and the cost of the potential solutions to achieve those reductions is realized we expect an increase in the use of cost effective livestock waste treatment to fill that need with our proven and commercial ready solution we anticipate the utilization of bions proprietary technology to grow significantly
3111546 i think this definitely is a rivalry i mean what better story is this the storied franchise of the chicago cubs facing off with this little team 90 miles to the north in the big picture its david and goliath but what a story chicago is facing its 100th year without a title and big chicago is getting a run for its money by a dangerous small market milwaukee team i was there last night it was the best game ive seen in july in a long time and the two cities the proximity cubs and brewers fans made it sound like a european soccer game it was a great game a great atmosphere and a great story
3111547 mr mariotti i saw you on around the horn today and i just wanted to say that i totally agree with you about the cubs and the brewers rivalry im glad its getting its due attention

3111635 is the goal of the russian federation to change the leadership of georgia
3111636 sometimes those leaders need to contemplate how useful they have become to their people
3111637 we must condemn russias military assault on the sovereign state of georgia including the targeting of civilians and the campaign of terror against the georgian population
3111638 since russia is impeding georgian forces from withdrawing rejecting a cease fire and continuing to carry out military attacks against civilian centers its claims of a humanitarian purpose clearly are not credible
3111639 there was no indication the person was headed to the school
3111640 i wish i had the unbridled lascivious vocabulary of a man because all i can keep coming up with is hot

3111645 divide up all mlb history by presidential administrations find the ballplayer from that era who is most similar to the president and explain the comparisons the downside is that it runs the risk of becoming political the point of this is to be fun not to get people caught up in some damn debate still i want to get the guys who i think are good comps
3111646 failure to do so would create a monthly cash flow deficit for the gas station
3111647 thats a good question in many cases but not all its because the gas station owner is trying to hang on to that extra profit margin for as long he she can
3111648 many would try to hang on to it even after they received the next cheaper gasoline delivery if they could but market forces usually prevent that

3111651 exhaustiva investigaci n de los hechos y se indague sobre las motivaciones del asalto

3111654 pop and realized that i hand gotten past the tip and that it was now in my ass like my finger
3111655 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
3111656 but most of the audience thought it was being shown live so that was mission accomplished
3111657 of freedom of worship he received regular updates on the military standoff between russia and georgia a former soviet state and switching from leader to olympics fan bush watched as michael phelps won the gold in the 400 meter individual medley
3111658 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
3111659 once again i had a very uplifting experience going to a church
3111660 it was a spirit filled feeling as you know i feel very strongly about religion and im so appreciative of the chance to go to church here
3111661 this is a good testament to the importance you place on u s relations with china
3111662 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
3111663 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
3111664 i know you came here from the swimming center and would like to offer you my congratulations on the excellent performance of mr phelps
3111665 if we saw an 8 percent across the board it would be more impressive but none of these daypart categories are going down
3111666 then he will also say to those on his left depart from me accursed ones into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels for i was hungry and you me nothing to eat
3111667 one of the major tasks of the acftu in 2006 is to push foreign funded or transnational companies to unionise
3111668 independent trade unions are illegal in china with all workers belonging to acftu
3111669 however labour analysts say the acftu has had a poor record in improving worker rights
3111670 i had to find one place of truth one dialogue without falsity
3111671 they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way and unfortunately it hasnt happened to me i feel like i played well enough to win probably more than two majors throughout my career
3111672 for your sake we face death all day long we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered
3111673 the sellers have been irrational and difficult with regardto valuation the shareholders of value financial now wantedmore money
3111674 the acquisition would have been beneficial at the sametime i give management credit for being realistic in valuingacquisitions and protecting shareholders money
3111675 the fundamental case to justify 150 a barrel oil never made sense
3111676 i think it was a speculative bubble that people tried to massage the fundamentals around

3111682 from the day i met him thats what he wanted to do join the marines both of his grandfathers were in the service he looked up to them his grandfather herb mckiski is like his hero he wanted to be like him and his dad was his best friend he looked up to his dad for everything
3111683 he had not an ounce of body fat on him he didnt always smile he kind of had a smirk but he was just so kind he was very worried about our parents with the divorce he tried to be with mom and dad
3111684 he loved to snowboard he had a camaro which he totaled and a trans am it was the most beautiful black car and they sold it because the gas prices were too much in california
3111685 i worked alongside of adam for two years now as an artillery mechanic he was a stand up guy adam was the guy everyone wanted to be around because of his attitude
3111686 he just brought out the best in everybody he loved his family and his friends he was my best friend
3111687 he treated our dog kaylee like it was our kid wed go hiking with her take her to the beach

3111690 cory is not currently running and we are currentlyassessing our plans going forward regarding that facility
3111691 one must not hurry on such serious issues as serious mistakes can be made that have to be paid for a long time afterwards
3111692 at the heart of the slave market then there was a contradiction and a contest the contradiction was this the abstract value that under wrote the southern economy could only be made material in human shape frail sentient and resistant and thus the contradiction was daily played out in a contest over meaning were slave sales as so many slaveholders insisted the unfortunate result of untimely deaths unavoidable debts unforseeable circumstances and understandable punishments or were they as so many slaves felt the natural inevitable and predictable result of a system that treated people as property
3111693 the slave traders did not ignore or abolish the humanity of the people they categorized and compared and bought and sold they used it to protect themselves and their investment the traders had to imagine the world from their slaves perspective to see geography and time and human connections and desire as their slaves did and to insinuate their surveillance and insert their discipline in every detail of the slaves existence
3111694 there was nothing automatic about the formation of a community of slaves in the trade the slave coffles and pens indeed were shot through with animosity and suspicion yet out of these contingent interactions could be fashioned connections that could sustain slaves emotionally and help them circulate important knowledge about the trade
3111695 built out of people who could be bought in the market slaveholding households were advertisements for their masters for their gentility and distinction for the delicacy of their women the tone of their lives and the quality of their service
3111696 they bought slaves to make themselves frugal independent socially acceptable or even fully white they acted in accordance with the necessities of their their business or the exigencies of their households they covered the contingency of their own identities in the capacious promises of paternalism buying on behalf of the bought they obscured the dependency of their fantasies with the brutality of their mastery
3111697 the traders daily business was to shape the real people they had in their hands to reflect the abstract market they had in their heads and then to punctuate their categories of comparison with the value producing practice of differentiation the special clothes and spatial arrangement the articulated human connections the singular story
3111698 the rituals of the slave pens taught the inexperienced how to read black bodies for their suitability for slavery how to imagine blackness into meaning how to see solutions to their own problems in the bodies of the slaves they saw in the market gazing touching stripping and analyzing aloud the buyers read slaves bodies as if they were coded versions of their own imagined needs age was longevity dark skin immunity a stout trunk stamina firm muscles production firm breasts fecundity clear skin good character
3111699 but is buying on trial allowed slaveholders an opportunity to extend the slave market in time and space it also gave slaves an opportunity to examine their buyers and choose whether to match or subvert their evident expectations
3111700 life in the shadow of the slave market was framed by the tension between the fantasies the slaveholders purchased in the market and the real people they brought home from the pens
3111701 the piteous image of a twelve year old child beaten because he could not stop his nose from running onto the dinner napkins was not as some scholars would have it a violation of the utuality of master and slave it was instead the essence of that grim mutuality the natural result of slaveholders inevitable failure to live through the stolen bodies of their slaves

3111709 it would be unfair to consumers with accounts at other firms as well as to the firms that settled if our investigation were to slow down or stop
3111710 our investigations focus is shifting to the next group of market participants
3111711 we are meeting with regulators monday in jefferson city missouri and look forward to the discussions
3111712 i agree with you 100 percent that these times call for being positive and truthful
3111713 the truth is this problem will not be fixed from the top down
3111714 because they failed to be realistic twice the banks are flooding the market with reos at depressed prices sometimes lower than the short sale offers they received im positive that banking reform or at least intelligent banking management is necessary to allow us individuals to assist in liquidating problem properties from excessive inventories
3111715 a national mls is not needed but a gateway system with some national data standards would be a great help
3111716 local mlss always have borders so the need to display or share data from a neighboring mls is necessary we need a cost effective way of accomplishing that goal while allowing local expertise to influence the local system
3111717 we need national data standards to allow all brokers to compete with third party aggregates they publish a standard and we all deliver data to them in their format they deliver consistent results with great data translation because the sending party did the translation
3111718 national franchises large brokers and small brokers would all benefit from a standard internet data display format since the cost of delivering solutions would be driven down due to the lack of having to deal with 700 different data formats and rules
3111719 im not convinced that a brand is a balloon or gold jacket or even a dog wearing a gold jacket as has been suggested
3111720 the brand itself is defined by the interactions that a customer has with a company
3111721 the reason so much of real estate has become commoditized is that with no real barriers to entry anyone can become an agent whether they are capable of or willing to deliver that high level brand experience to their clients or not
3111722 unfortunately too many agents tend to do far too little on behalf of their clients but at some point the clients have figured all of this out and thats where new commission structures and pricing systems gain their first foothold
3111723 and as has also been suggested somewhere within all of this chaos and confusion is where opportunity awaits
3111724 it seems that everything that is old shoe real estate is dying with technological advances in regards to data collection marketing imaging mls etc
3111725 the technology is available to everybody its the way that the technology is used that will separate a pro from a novice
3111726 sellers will no doubt want to list the property with someone who they like trust and have confidence in the data presentation may have nothing to do with the outcome
3111727 not much of a surprise here the surprise is that although the times now knows that real estate in newspapers is dead so many brokers dont
3111728 the paradigm has changed real estate is shopped online now maybe someday soon the brokers who justify spending six figures in newspaper ads each month will wake up and smell the internet
3111729 its trial by fire theres drama here this is a tough town
3111730 we have many difficult and challenging assignments every day we wanted to give them some practical exposure

3111738 these poll results demonstrate that parents are as apprehensive about their childrens media diets as they are about traditional social issues such as alcohol drugs violence and sex
3111739 when it comes to video games parents should know that what they play is a resource that helps demystify one of the most popular and challenging forms of entertainment their kids are into
3111740 although these findings seem surprising at first they hint at fears parents have about video games
3111741 to some parents video games are full of unknowable dangers while researching for grand theft childhood parents we spoke with in focus groups often bemoaned the fact that they didnt know how to use game controls and felt unequipped to supervise or limit video game play of course parents dont want their children drinking alcohol but thats a more familiar risk
3111742 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3111743 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3111744 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3111745 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3111746 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3111747 what russia is doing in georgia is open unhidden aggression and a challenge to the whole world if the whole world does not stop russia today then russian tanks will be able to reach any other european capital
3111748 95 percent of female suicide attacks occurred within the context of a military campaign against occupying forces
3111749 the main motives and circumstances that drive female suicide attackers are quite similar to those that drive men
3111750 is mainly a demand driven not a supply limited phenomenon
3111751 i think al qaeda has discovered that because a great job as been done they just cannot drive their vbieds vehicle borne improvised explosive devises like they used to we see an adjustment that is the suicide vest attack
3111752 women have the tactical advantage of evading arrest of disguising the bomb
3111753 how can it be critical literacy if it is all the same
3111754 ligne roset is responsible for the spaces design but the food falls under the culinary jurisdiction of neil manacle former chef de cuisine of bar americain and bolo it makes sense given his history that spice figures prominently in dishes like red snapper crudo and seviche with persian cucumbers and serrano chiles smoked paprika rubbed pork tenderloin and spice crusted lamb with fried hummus
3111755 as at delectica his murray hill caf chef partner erez cohen takes a nutritionally minded environmentally friendly approach using organic chickpeas flour and eggs and packaging takeout orders in eco containers
3111756 the menu at vintage irving will feature many small entr e like dishes encouraging tables to order many to share like the contamplano salad spanish chorizo with white beans white asparagus buffalo mozzarella red pepper and olive tapenade bouillabaisse stocked with shrimp clams calamari mussels and topped with a rouille slathered crouton and a grilled shell steak with bleu cheese mashed potatoes red onion confit and a port wine reduction
3111757 working closely with subaru engineers we were able to demonstrate the ability of powerflush iii to meet their critical cooling exchange requirements

3111764 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3111765 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3111766 theres no question that americans are desperately looking for change and new ways to conduct business in this country they want a new direction they want to know that their government has not forgotten them and their lives we felt that the democratic convention was a great way to kick off the momentum for change

3111770 i own it now and so im the one who gets to decide bernadettes children are as entitled to their family legacy as any other sullivan cousin
3111771 thats because my mothers afraid of you shes afraid of boring you she tells this story to everyone
3111772 i dont know if i should be flattered or offended
3111773 he looked leaner handsomer than anyone had remembered and he had a lumpy bundle tied to his back
3111774 look at that statue over there thats what bernadette used to look like
3111775 then one day something turned inside the bay of easkey suddenly the sea could not do enough for my great grandfather every fish within twenty miles swam into his net the more fish he pulled out the more people lined up to buy them he made three times as much as he had ever made in a day and that led to three times as much drinking and the generous buying of drinks and soon the men were talking about the statue of the virgin
3111776 the men were making some mildly scandalous toasts to her beauty and his wifes beauty and my adventuresome youth
3111777 it didnt belong to them not them specifically and the lovells were all pretty attached to it in the end she gave it to my grandmother loretta the one with the short leg and all of her siblings were so furious that loretta had to pack up the statue and her family and take the boat to boston
3111778 people in my family take this very seriously when loretta moved to florida she gave the statue to my mother and from there well
3111779 that isnt such a bad story there are certainly worse ones out there

3111907 this conflict is likely to be brief and fit into a general pattern of tensions within the former borders of the soviet union
3111908 this fight is about 70 000 people who feel more affinity to russia than they do for the breakaway state
3111909 its not the sort of fight that raises major issue for the u s and its not in a strategic location to warrant our deeper involvement

3111953 that whoa connection is the biggest part of my job i mean weve heard about the loss of arctic ice pack about the loss of habitat up there but if people can say hey i remember meeting ferdinand at seaworld then those people know animals that are affected by climate change they remember them otherwise those people might not care as much about the loss of the beluga whales or the polar bears

3111957 every time the kid has a headache they are worried about a failure every time she has a fever they are worried about a shunt infection
3111958 our position right now is that theyre not going to be as big as some people think
3111959 a lot of the hype was promoted by the media playing up the asus eee pc and some companies have a vested interest like intel
3111960 were going to see all the big names get in there
3111961 offers a unique growth opportunity that should be thoughtfully considered
3111962 the netbook has tremendous potential expanding a users on the go access to basic computing features such as email web surfing instant messaging and digital photo browsing by providing consumers with a secondary pc that complements todays powerful full featured laptops through ultra mobility and a low price point
3111963 when i talk to manufacturers they tell me its a defensive move they dont want to give up the opportunity to someone else in case it balloons and then itll be harder to get into the market
3111964 it is a mobile internet gadget it will not replace your desktop or laptops at home
3111965 there are segments where this makes sense we think education particularly among younger kids
3111966 are not inclined to make big ticket purchases like homes
3111967 it is possible that poor weather conditions particularly in central and eastern canada magnified the decline in construction
3111968 it was the second consecutive monthly decline and the most significant since december last year
3111969 the overall level of new residential construction activity recorded in july fell significantly short of expectations for a total of 210 000 starts
3111970 but it was ontarios 28 per cent pullback in starts that weighed the most on national figures
3111971 the price softening housing market is mostly due to western canada
3111972 calgary about two years ago was at almost 60 per cent increases but now its at 0 1 per cent in july
3111973 thats really been the drive in the last two years is whats happening in alberta
3111974 is downshifting from the elevated rates of activity of recent years
3111975 after a strong first half of the year the volatile multiple segment is now readjusting itself
3111976 as an average for this year its possible just given how high starts were in the first half of the year
3111977 in the second half of this year housing starts will be far lower quite likely under 200 000
3111978 one should not read too much into an oversized drop in multiple starts in a single month the month to month volatility in this market segment is remarkably high on both the upside and downside
3111979 should experience a cooling after running too hot for too long
3111980 will continue to moderate in some cities we will see outright declines as were already seeing in calgary edmonton and victoria

3111989 we dont want any financial support or corporate support but it is the people who need to join hands to celebrate the birthday of the city
3111990 we want all chennai residents and those who wish to celebrate the citys birthday on voluntary basis it is purely based on their interest
3111991 the upa governments economic policies are dictated by the world bank imf and the us all talk of liberalisation and globalisation is for their benefit and we in the left will take the fight against it to the streets with the nation wide general strike on august 20
3111992 the manmohan singh government might have won a pyrrhic victory but its efforts to isolate the left has come to a nought with several constituents of the unpa including tdp and agp besides the bsp and rld veering towards us as part of the exercise to cobble together an alternative to the upa and nda
3111993 pakistani troops lobbed 60 mm mortars and continued with small arms fire at the poonch indian post from 12 30 hours to 13 30 hours this afternoon
3111994 all the talk about market touching its bottom is not really helpful as nobody knows where that is not many know where to sell and where to buy nobody knows where the bottom is
3111995 diversification is key we are currently neutral on equities and underweight on debt investors can take exposure to gold through exchange traded funds or buying shares of gold mining companies real estate can also be given a second look special offerings that seek to invest in private equity are also recommended but obviously with a longer investment horizon
3111996 inflation has not peaked out yet in a month or so inflation might go up to 12 5 13 per cent but by the end of this fiscal year it might be around 8 per cent that is above the central banks expectations
3111997 so far there is no such move if any proposal comes we will study it and react to it after taking legal opinion
3111998 clients have moved from tolerance to believing and we are seeing the insurers beginning to collaborate more often than confront
3111999 we envisage that in 3 to 5 years about 65 to 70 per cent of the insurance business in india will be brokered total dismantling of the tariffs will facilitate the faster growth of insurance brokers in india
3112000 it has already been established that there is no link between futures trade and price rise the ban on the four commodities is likely to be lifted in september

3112002 wl ross is one of the largest and the most experienced investor in the world with this investment we have no doubt that spicejet will fulfil its promise of emerging as indias leading airline
3112003 is even greater as not only has india won a gold medal at the olympics after a very long gap of 28 years but also because you have become the first ever indian to win a gold medal at the olympics in an event
3112004 should inspire confidence among all indian sportspersons that they can achieve the pinnacle of any sports at the international level and be also inspiration for more of our youths to take up sports as a full time career

3112015 i support the growing partnership between india and united states and that is why i voted for the us india nuclear accord and i will continue to work to strengthen the bond between our two nations a bond that is enriched by the presence of the indian americans in the us
3112016 natural that the worlds oldest and the worlds largest constitutional democracies should enjoy strong relations
3112017 gigantic older problems of persistent deprivation of human lives tolerated without much political protest
3112018 justice demands that we make a strong effort to identify the overwhelming priorities that have to be confronted with total urgency
3112019 we have to ask what should keep us awake at night
3112020 drawn from the world view that amartya has come to represent
3112021 this world view is captured by what our government has defined as inclusive growth
3112022 the world is watching us so lets show them what we are made up of
3112023 we have trained long and hard for this day it is time to showcase our professionalism
3112024 sachin tendulkar was a big part of their batting line up they do bank a lot on sachin rahul and probably sourav we knew that those guys in the middle had to be controlled somehow
3112025 virender sehwag is really batting well but he plays a different game all together those three guys are the ones who actually take the innings along and built on big innings and take the game away from you
3112026 we had lot of discussions on how to do it we attacked them from the game one we did not let them get to any easy start we put lot of pressure on them we bowled to good areas we bowled to certain plans we had that probably was the difference
3112027 winning an olympic gold medal is something really great and my congratulations on behalf of the indian cricket team congratulations to abhinav bindra for a fantastic effort
3112028 its a great effort to become a world champion and winning an individual medal in a sport is a greater achievement

3112030 we will first announce the launch of the party before the media and then hold a public meeting by the end of this month you will get to know all the details of the partys policies and programmes
3112031 only a few decades back nobody knew about the santoor even in jammu today there are restaurants and even a soap is named after it
3112032 in the last few days prices of non levy sugar in the open market have increased in spite of much higher availability of sugar in the september quarter compared to last year
3112033 good buying ahead of festivals like raksha bandhan is weighing on prices
3112034 the total private procurement declared by these firms comes to about 11 lakh tons only
3112035 how can it be that only 11 lakh tons have been purchased in the private sector when the country exported rice much more than that
3112036 letter to a new president commonsense lessons for our next leader
3112037 son of privilege and dynasty who had defined himself as the president of only that fraction of the country which shared his world view
3112038 sen byrd doesnt believe sen mccain is going to be the next president
3112039 but if sen mccain is interested in receiving a copy of the book wed be happy to get him a copy
3112040 a big lie is still a lie tell the truth
3112041 let the press do its job even when that might sting
3112042 i would submit that a president who is unable to learn from his or her own mistakes and then to articulate for a curious public what he or she has learned is not prepared for that office
3112043 banished himself to the ignominious position of worst united states president ever
3112044 built much of its program around a basic commitment to lying
3112045 we must rebuild a culture of intolerance to lying and that must start close to home
3112046 are fireworks still the best we can do we invented them a million years ago and they look basically the same as they always did why havent they evolved to be even more spectacular why is it still impossible to describe d rers bunny on the night every bunny hair separate distinct and on fire
3112047 some part of the ceremony are cinematic and this part is just cinema
3112048 i dont feel like its bad luck because i survived the one thing i did was i made sure i didnt bump my head the lady paramedic made sure i was 100 comfortable while i was on the way to the hospital she deserves a raise
3112049 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3112050 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3112051 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3112052 if i had more money i would have stayed and never gone back
3112053 we hear from other returnees that they had regret going back because there is still bombing kidnapping and killing
3112054 god willing the flights will continue in order to fetch all families that wish to come back we welcome all our citizens who want to come home
3112055 some iraqis are choosing to return because the situation has improved in their areas but many others find themselves under many pressures in the host countries as their savings and resources have been exhausted

3112061 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3112062 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3112063 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3112064 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3112065 i was thinking someone throw a bomb in my window some hot explosion and i see the glass i touch the glass

3112310 the msi r4850 what is there to say about this video card except that it rocked the msi r4850 was not only able to overclock higher than the sapphire hd4850 that i recently tested but the msi card was also able to stay cooler under a full load than the sapphire by about 20 c i was very surprised when i saw that this card was competitively priced with the other hd4850 cards that have the stock cooling solution which adds an extra value to the card the performance of the r4850 surpassed the sapphire hd4850 not by much however in the benchmark world every point makes a difference and adds even more value to the card

3112321 i love to know what magic its engineers infused into the biostar tpower i45 motherboard to make it an overclocking monster but reaching 600mhz fsb with this board is a real possibility on first glance the biostar tpower i45 motherboard has the appearence of a standard mid range enthusiast friendly platform but its not until you start overclocking that its true potential becomes apparent as well see later in the review the tpower i45 is based on intels new and very popular p45 express and ich10r chipsets

3112323 the surprise of recent months is not that global economic growth is slowing but that there is any growth at all the credit crunch of the past year has not followed the path of recent economically debilitating episodes characterized by a temporary freezing up of liquidity 1982 1989 1997 8 comes to mind this crisis is different a once or twice a century event deeply rooted in fears of insolvency of major financial institutions this crisis was not brought to closure by the worlds central banks injection of huge doses of short term liquidity only when sovereign credits were substituted for private bank credit first in the case of the uk northern rock and subsequently in the case of the us bear stearns was a semblance of stability restored to markets but the london interbank offered rate spreads on overnight index swaps and credit default swaps of financial institutions have not returned to the modest pre crisis levels fears of insolvency have not as yet been fully set aside there may be numbers of banks and other financial institutions that at the edge of defaulting will end up being bailed out by governments the insolvency crisis will come to an end only as home prices in the us begin to stabilize and clarify the level of equity in homes the ultimate collateral support for much of the financial worlds mortgage backed securities however us home prices will stabilize only when the absorption of the huge excess of single family vacant homes that emerged as the us housing boom peaked in 2006 is much further advanced than it is now new single family home completions are currently barely under the rate of home demand generated by household formation and replacement needs only later this year will the current suppressed level of housing starts be reflected in completion levels consistent with a rapid rate of liquidation of the inventory glut and this of course assumes that current levels of demand for housing hold up

3112325 state local tax burdens dip as income growth outpaces tax growth
3112326 a tv spot claims obama once voted for a tax increase on people making just 42 000 a year thats true for a single taxpayer who would have seen a tax increase of 15 for the year if the measure had been enacted but the ad shows a woman with two children and as a single mother she would not have been affected unless she made more than 62 150 the increase that obama once supported as part of a democratic budget bill is not part of his current tax plan anyway a spanish language radio ad claims the measure obama supported would have raised taxes on families making 42 000 which is simply false even a single mother with one child would have been able to make 58 650 without being affected a family of four with income up to 90 000 would not have been affected the tv ad claims in a graphic that obama would raise taxes on middle class in fact obamas plan promises cuts for middle income taxpayers and would increase rates only for persons with family incomes above 250 000 or with individual incomes above 200 000 the radio ad claims obama would increase taxes on the sale of your home in fact home sale profits of up to 500 000 per couple would continue to be exempt from capital gains taxes very few sales would see an increase under obamas proposal to raise the capital gains rate a second radio ad in english says obama has a history of raising taxes on middle class americans but thats false it refers to a vote that did not actually result in a tax increase and could not have done so

3112348 for the last two or so years it seems that amd has not be able to get out of its own way from horribly timed acquisitions to botched chipsets and gpu cpus these last few years have been painful to watch as amd has had one failure after another but recently someone at amd or more probably several someones made a decision to move back into more comfortable territory instead of trying to compete head to head at the high end level amd seems to have returned to an earlier philosophy one that caught the minds and wallets of the diyers and enthusiasts
3112349 a few months ago i reviewed a ddr3 kit from kingston that supported 1800mhz operation at fairly fast timings it was criticized by some that the modules did not include xmp information to aid in easy system setup fast forward to the current market and the khx14400d2k2 2gx delivers xmp support

3112530 the bites wrapped up the competition without being outscored in any game
3112531 our only loss came on penalty kicks to the eventual champ the german team
3112532 the bites were plagued by continuing camera problems the fault of the robots not the students and played much of the match essentially blind
3112533 the result leaves the bites tied for fifth place in the world and guarantees a spot in next years competition in austria

3112571 as under the russians in chechnya it looks like the communists in china are battling another form of totalitarianism to come jihadism
3112572 china will continue to pursue a policy of support to other jihadist forces including the islamist regime in khartoum
3112573 a new afghanistan with jihadists converging from central asia and other parts of the world
3112574 a turkistan islamist movement with links in central asia stretching back to afghanistan and pakistan blending taliban training
3112575 is a very different entity than china has faced in the past
3112576 beijing would be unable to use information from raiding one cell to find another this appears to be exactly what we are seeing now the central tip core uses the internet and videos as psychological tools to trigger a reaction from beijing and inspire militants without exposing itself to detection or capture
3112577 the alleged activities seem to fit a pattern within the international jihadist movement of paying more attention to china islamists have considered china something less imperialistic and thus less threatening than the united states and european powers but this began changing with the launch of the sco shanghai cooperative organization designed to monitor terrorism in russian and asia and the trend has been accelerating with chinas expanded involvement in africa and central asia and its continued support for pakistans government
3112578 opportunistically using the post 11 september environment to make the outrageous claim that individuals disseminating peaceful religious and cultural messages in xinjiang are terrorists who have simply changed tactics
3112579 they dont espouse violence they espouse sharia does china want to live under sharia do free people want to live under sharia does it matter that hizb ut tahrir wont be blowing anyone up on its way to instituting this oppressive system

3112582 i wondered if you might be able to suggest a good book on revising the first draft of a novel
3112583 i had similar problems with my book and found it helpful to turn to classic works of literature that have things in common with my book to see how they did it since your book is very plot oriented you might try something like jane austen puts her reader at the heart of the plot immediately and yet the dialogues so revelatory that you never feel anythings missing in terms of character development if dialogue isnt your strong suit look around for another writer who shares your strengths to see how they use them francine prose has a good book about how to read books for this purpose i know this sounds like a much more labor intensive way of learning but i dont know of a how to book that really answers this question

3112591 it was so sad to hear about isaac hayes so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best god bless
3112592 i last saw isaac a while back in washington d c at a concert where we were both performing although he was under the weather he was still performing he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls god bless his family
3112593 three time grammy winner isaac hayes was a true renaissance man singer songwriter producer session musician actor activist and more his groundbreaking theme song and score for the movie shaft cemented his status as a musical icon the world has lost a true creative genius and a passionate humanitarian but his indelible legacy will remain ever present our deepest sympathies go out to his family friends and all who were inspired by the man and his music
3112594 i am shocked we have lost not only an incredible talent but a wonderful leader to his community and a dear friend to me there will only be one isaac hayes gifting us with years of performing writing and a voice that penetrated deep into our souls he is to be admired for changing his life around and standing steadfast to his beliefs his integrity and to helping others isaac you will be missed but never forgotten
3112595 isaac was one of the more genuine and beautiful souls i have had the privilege to cross paths with and befriend in this life he was an incredible friend this is a tragic loss my heart goes out to his wife and children wherever he is going to just became a brighter and more beautiful place and i will miss him dearly
3112596 i owe so much of my fame and success to isaac hayes as it was isaac who wrote produced and actually invented what is known as the

3112604 we appreciate you keeping rachels name out there and to keep the story going in the news but we have nothing to say they the police pretty much put us through hell and high water
3112605 there are going to be a lot of cases that this could affect
3112606 we need to make sure our laws are adequate to deal with these acts of violence we need to make sure juries hear this type of evidence
3112607 its really an emotional law rather than a well thought out law
3112608 i dont think its a wise law its going to lead to the potential for wrongful convictions which illinois has a history of because its going to allow in a lot of unreliable stuff
3112609 i thought when i retired i could forget but i cant people dont just disappear i look at it as a failure because we never found rachel and no one ever got arrested rachel deserves better

3112614 most of the guys i dated were captivated by my heart but they had different ways of trying to get to me
3112615 i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world
3112616 i suppose some would be shocked at our seeming worldliness and levity but just underneath there is deadly earnestness faith has to work twenty four hours a day in and through us or we perish
3112617 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hard core family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3112618 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
3112619 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
3112620 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather
3112621 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
3112622 a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives
3112623 his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set
3112624 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
3112625 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
3112626 warped tour was great but we cant wait to get back into venues that actually have roofs over our heads and arent 110 degrees

3112639 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
3112640 im proud of him because politics is dirty especially with republicans
3112641 we wont allow the death of our compatriots to go unpunished
3112642 i want this to end when im on top so im planning my final show on december 21 2012 its when the mayan calendar ends its the day when solids become liquids and liquids become plasmas
3112643 so im building up to that weve got four years so maybe theres going to be a couple other small releases in the works the album just came out so i have no plans for another release but im constantly starting to work on new stuff just for the live shows
3112644 i used to play very short sets and now i kinda play a standard 45 minute to one hour set so i think i wanna do a 24 hour set and i want it to be a stage production but one where the lines become blurry between reality and complete stage me i want it to be an endurance test and i want it to be miserable and equally fantastic i want the best of both worlds
3112645 i think in too many shows people are too aimed at pleasing the audience if you want to do a really great show which i havent fully done yet you have to really make it bad for them for like 20 hours and then you can kill it for four hours and everyone will be really excited i think people ignore the dynamics of how you can work with an audience
3112646 for us to accomplish that mission we needed to shed a lot of extra baggage
3112647 we needed to focus a little more we needed to make quicker decisions we needed to be ok saying no to certain stuff and we needed to weed through stuff quicker
3112648 one of the coolest things was rick actually suggested that we all stand up and rock out like we would live
3112649 and we did and it put a lot of life into the basic tracking of it all it was almost to the point where when i was retracking stuff i was standing up headbanging id never done that in a recording situation before hes a great song doctor and he has great ears
3112650 the great thing about working with rick is hes never around
3112651 i would say thats a very strong point in that it leaves the four of us to take on the entire brunt of the work and the planning that goes into the songwriting process and the recording process
3112652 bob would add a lot of his own musical input and with that came a lot of his own influences and style and jurisdiction and idiosyncrasies
3112653 and it would eventually make it into our sound but with rick because he wasnt there its almost 100 percent undiluted metallica hed come in and say thats good that isnt change that and we would have to figure that out for ourselves this is the most pure weve sounded in a long time
3112654 rick is not the kind of producer like a bob rock whos there every moment holding your hand making you step up
3112655 rock arranged everything all the time and wore many hats in the studio rick rubin no hat rick comes in and goes well wheres the songs ok thats good thats not so good more of this less of that see you in a few months goodbye and thats what we needed that brutal honesty to get through it and it worked
3112656 the slipknot that he did the system of a down records he did and even the johnny cash stuff where its the essence of him and you hear him you hear whats going on thats what i want i want people to really hear metallica
3112657 so in a way its got somewhat of an older sound songs and arrangement wise weve got a lot more diversity on the record instrumentals fast shorter songs epic ballady moments its quite different from st anger where if youre angry this is your album and if youre not it might take some work
3112658 didnt seem to fit the world that i thought stephenie meyer created
3112659 you see the punch coming that doesnt mean its not gonna hurt when it hits
3112660 theres no way to make everybody happy when i do one thing that a lot of people want theres always the opposite reaction
3112661 but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
3112662 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
3112663 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
3112664 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
3112665 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
3112666 i should have known that people would feel that way
3112667 the name has been real to me for so long now that ive forgotten how unusual it would sound to everyone else
3112668 ive read a lot of books that i didnt like very much and that thought never occurred to me because i had read them i hadnt heard of doing that before thats not fun to hear
3112669 i hope that if they really do enjoy the other books theyll realize that this is kind of where it was supposed to go

3112690 it seemed so weird last time we spoke you admitted to a lifelong fear of condiments i dont want to get you upset
3112691 we have a speculative bubble in prices thats giving way to what now i think are more moderate levels
3112692 i think we look forward to a resumption of an improvement in equity prices based on still good earnings coming out of many companies
3112693 everything to play for and ours are all good jumpers
3112694 i went as fast as i could cav is not a thoroughbred and hasnt got that speed so i kept to as tight a line as i could i did not even notice the rain but i was just slightly out of my comfort zone
3112695 how will the reds make up for those home runs
3112696 when hes wild hes either wild high left or wild low right
3112697 youre serving in tennis serving to the ad court youll probably be wide low right and in the deuce court wild high left so what were trying to get him to do is open his body pretending hes in the deuce court to get the ball on target
3112698 just lines up and runs directly at you again and again and it makes me a usc trojan so bored after we crush them into dust
3112699 especially with the speed of the game and special formations
3112700 last year it was basically almost the same one formation the i set form now theres no telling where well line up we can do so much and its real good i love it because the defense doesnt know what to expect
3112701 hes hit the jackpot really he was a very young player at a very good team with a very good prospect of becoming a top player and possibly an international player
3112702 in terms of precedent this sees the common law principles of personal injury applied to the football pitch
3112703 the equivalent in football has always been possible but very often the players most susceptible to such injury were getting on a bit or their lawyers have had difficulty showing that it was one tackle in particular that caused an injury as happened in the alf inge haaland vs roy keane case in 2002
3112704 what makes this exceptional is that its one of the first in which these usual defences the problem of causation or a player being late in his career just didnt apply
3112705 reflected mr colletts talent and potential as one of the brightest young footballers in the country
3112706 but he would have far preferred to have earned the money through a full career in football
3112707 por lo menos las calles est n m s limpias
3112708 we go sky see nana pop pop abby be careful cars
3112709 mother dearest please confirm that we have indeed secured passage via over priced airline to see my delightful grandparents oh and mother be wary of crossing the street
3112710 i feel sick to my stomach i believe the intention was to intimidate me and he has succeeded
3112711 it isnt against the law for someone to view a house but theres a reasonable expectation that the inspection is by someone who is interested in buying
3112712 my name is on the certificate of title which is given to all prospective buyers
3112713 the soulsville foundation which operates the stax museum of american soul music stax music academy and the soulsville charter school is so deeply saddened by the passing of isaac hayes that we are in state of shock

3112717 the jesuit educated lawyer and charismatic orator sought to transform cuba into an egalitarian society and achieved health and literacy levels on a par with industrialized nations
3112718 castro was born on august 13 1926 in biran in eastern cuba the son of a spanish immigrant who became a landowner his familys farm was the first land castro ordered confiscated by the state after his revolution
3112719 the ragtag band of rebels grew into a guerrilla force of several thousand that swept down from the hills in 1958 to drive the dictator batista from cuba on new years day 1959
3112720 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
3112721 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
3112722 my she sured be purty without that paci in her mouth
3112723 one of the arguments for the allowances is youre never not a public figure any more you are always a public figure once youve been prime minister and or governor general that carries with it certain responsibilities
3112724 it involves quite a lot of duties stuff you wouldnt be doing if you were just a private citizen
3112725 where the cost of a game is 60 dollars you could also rent games so if you know your disposable income is less youre probably not going to stop being a gamer youre probably just going to start coming about it from a different direction
3112726 rental is one path buying used games over here has become huge and i believe it is starting to really take off in the uk as well so if youre really in dire straits you still can play games
3112727 i dont think thats because gamers are being cheap and they feel the value proposition isnt there i think its more that thats what they can afford and thats what their threshold is for the entertainment
3112728 we wanted to send him bainimarama on leave and appoint saubuluinayau to the post that was the closest we ever got
3112729 the sdl led government always worked within the law of the country even in relation to dealing with personnel in the civil service

3112734 these are young cool well dressed articulate bank robbers chris be the little homey
3112735 at the end of the day im going to focus on my music first
3112736 but me being onstage enhances me being in the movie and then me being in the movie acting catching characters gives me time to transform into a different character onstage
3112737 sl tip omg i love that outfit where did you get it
3112738 you want to do the absolute best that you can
3112739 i never got invited you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am

3112755 the ban didnt sour me about british racing at all its just part of the learning experience
3112756 thats the way ive ridden for the past 34 years and its hard to change the habits of a lifetime in one day there was no reference to the whip in the notes to visiting jockeys that i received but i believe they were mentioned in a notice on the wall in the jockeys room
3112757 i hadnt looked at them but thats no excuse the rules were on their side but getting four days is not to be taken lightly
3112758 id love to come back it was very different for me and it was quite challenging but the racing was very interesting
3112759 one thing the press got wrong was in believing that id never ridden in a two mile race before going back quite a few years every track would have a race over two circuits but two laps of a flat oval is very different to ascots two miles
3112760 it was great to have baze and ricardo meeting for the first time here at ascot but we are keen to keep coming up with new ideas to ensure it is something the public will continue to support the public response is telling us there is a need for days such as this in racing
3112761 we found pictures that we really loved on the computer and then we put them on the shirts and then we started designing them
3112762 it was all worth it because we got to see the jonas brothers

3112764 we wanted to get the best seats and we wanted to have fun camping out
3112765 well we go to hear their new songs too which was amazing the jonas brothers are worth camping out for any day
3112766 they really put everything they can into their music and they really love their fans so they deserve it
3112767 theyre great inspirations to kids theyre a very wholesome band and they put everything they can into it
3112768 the girls are naturally pretty tired it was a hell of an effort on sunday but they are both wekk up for the time trial so they have absolutely nothing to lose
3112769 we have the one big road medal from the road competition we targeted job done and anything else will be a bonus
3112770 nicoles win was a brilliant early tonic for the squad i am told they were all gathered together around a tv to shout her home and when we all got back to the village in the evening the place was buzzing
3112771 preparations have been reasonably smooth down on the velodrome although for some reason all the teams are finding it much colder in practice than when we competed here in the world cup earlier this year
3112772 that makes times significantly slower as does all the disturbed air from all the teams practicing on the track at the same time the net result is that we have to be careful how we interpret some of the times taken and tests we are doing apart from that it is business as usual
3112773 should have the option of keeping the coverage they have or choosing from a wide array of health insurance plans including many private health insurance options and a public plan

3112780 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3112781 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3112782 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3112783 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3112784 and if we end up screwing people because they bet against us that is their business
3112785 it was the fcc not me but the fcc that cost you billions of dollars

3112788 we obviously live in a car culture thats not about to change
3112789 the per diem system is what is perhaps it ought to be re examined but i think the leadership in particular just by virtue of the fact we give so much power to the leaders in wisconsin they would be there a long time
3112790 we were going to the first call and we didnt know he had an incident we didnt know he had a problem we didnt know he was having a bad morning so we kept on going

3112793 i didnt support it then in 2005 and i wont support it now theres just too many unknowns

3112799 i recognize that my family and i are in some danger of being sucked into the celebrity culture
3112800 the government cannot ban or censor celebrity culture it can support local civic engagement education and arts as alternatives and our leaders can speak out against the culture in this i would gladly join my republican opponent
3112801 this isnt a perfect piece of legislation but it is a way to make sure workers can join together and negotiate for the health care and benefits they deserve

3112805 in classic wag the dog scenario there is a neat little war brewing between american and russian proxies and real russian troops in the caucacus mountains on the russian border it couldnt come at a better time for the republicans mccain gets to act and talk tough against the russians while obama is on vacation in hawaii issuing cant we all get along statements it perfectly augments republican campaign points obama is not ready he is not tough experienced enough to deal with a dangerous world
3112806 a nation that uses one quarter of the worlds oil while possessing less than 3 percent of its reserves cannot drill its way to happiness at the pump much less self sufficiency the only plausible strategy is to cut consumption while embarking on a serious program of alternative fuels and energy sources this is a point the honest candidate should be making at every turn
3112807 as for the basis of your entire column that the republican party has become the party of stupid it is just sophomoric and pointless your column didnt express any new information or perspective it just reiterated old liberal talking points that you have recycled and reused in each of your past columns
3112808 but democratic party insiders have revealed that clooney and obama regularly send texts and emails to each other and speak by phone at least twice a week
3112809 judicial watch the public interest group that investigates and prosecutes government corruption announced today that it is launching an investigation into a nationwide effort by a liberal activist group to intimidate supporters of republican and conservative causes
3112810 to confront donors to conservative groups hoping to create a chilling effect that will dry up contributions the warning letter is intended as a first step alerting donors who might be considering giving to right wing groups to a variety of potential dangers including legal trouble public exposure and watchdog groups digging through their lives

3112812 nearly 10 000 of the biggest donors to republican candidates and causes across the country will probably receive a foreboding warning letter in the mail next week the letter is an opening shot across the bow from an unusual new outside political group on the left that is poised to engage in hardball tactics to prevent similar groups on the right from getting off the ground this fall

3112815 the united states must provide a very clear timeline to withdraw its troops from iraq as part of an agreement allowing them to stay beyond this year iraqi foreign minister hoshyar zebari said sunday
3112816 based on this and other hopeful suppositions the commands planners projected what the american occupation of iraq might look like after the main fighting was over there was to be a two to three month stabilization phase then an 18 to 24 month recovery phase that was to be followed by a 12 to 18 month transition phase at the end of this stage 32 to 45 months after the invasion began it was projected that the united states would have only 5 000 troops in iraq

3112821 we have been operating our tijuana plant for almost a decade and offer an experienced cost effective manufacturing base only minutes away from the u s we can offer automotive developers a distinctive set of skills for production runs from 250 to 1 500 vehicles per year and because we also provide for the aerospace industry our plant is as9100 certified
3112822 we understand all the steps in the process from the development of a prototype to final assembly whether youre talking about an electric vehicle powered wheel chair or a gas powered high performance car
3112823 advanced composites are unique in that they allow for limited production runs and are far more cost effective than metal stamping
3112824 we see this as an opportunity to use hst internationals expertise in automotive engineering composites and electric vehicles across a broader spectrum as a perfect fit with the companys overall strategy
3112825 the southwest usa is the perfect market for solar energy

3112835 its really an emotional law rather than a well thought out law
3112836 i dont think its a wise law its going to lead to the potential for wrongful convictions which illinois has a history of because its going to allow in a lot of unreliable stuff
3112837 i thought when i retired i could forget but i cant people dont just disappear i look at it as a failure because we never found rachel and no one ever got arrested rachel deserves better

3112860 i hope we could reach an agreement as much as possible
3112861 these talks will break off unless both sides fulfil earlier promises
3112862 if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and i will forgive their sin and heal their land
3112863 im proud to stand before you to tell you that i have never asked for or received a single pork barrel project for my state im proud of it
3112864 this plan prepares for the challenges ahead for people like me who are getting older
3112865 its a plan that looks forward as well as taking care of the needs we have now
3112866 a lot of people dont want to live in albuquerque
3112867 mass transit is not for everyone but there are so many people that it will work for that we have to re educate people in their way of thinking about it
3112868 based on our experience with similar measures wed expect the new mexico measures to pass
3112869 these agencies are receiving significant amounts of money that have not been paid to the workers
3112870 these workers are grossly underpaid by todays standards many of them are barely making more than the minimum wage
3112871 if were not able to settle with these agencies theres no other choice but to strike
3112872 i am very concerned about the epidemic in the region very concerned
3112873 the fight against hiv is a new problem its very challenging and it involves a lot of issues some of the work we do can be incompatible with the laws and practices of our countries
3112874 when a village finds out that a person has hiv life becomes very difficult almost impossible
3112875 their children cant go to school there could be physical violence they may not receive medical help because they are afraid of revealing their hiv status many decide to move
3112876 democrats have a common sense plan to lower gas prices
3112877 el incendio avanz en forma lineal y abarc casi la mitad del cerro el personal del parque tunari no pudo controlarlo y nuestro equipo envi un grupo de 15 personas especialistas en control de incendios desde las 17
3112878 monitoring the hiv aids epidemic would be wise to become more vigilant
3112879 is troubling and it suggests that eventually more may have to be done and probably sooner than later
3112880 the city must be prepared for the worst even as it continues to hope for the best
3112881 attention had been largely focused on sub saharan africa and other places where hiv aids treatment is far less accessible and awareness of the risks of infection is supposedly lower
3112882 federal funding for domestic aids programs has stalled during the bush presidency
3112883 bush administration has been less focused on domestic aids needs particularly regarding minorities
3112884 the world the united states and new jersey cannot afford to underestimate the threat and the suffering caused by aids
3112885 more routine testing could bring the rate of new infections down by alerting those who test positive that they are infectious
3112886 particularly those that gain traction among those most at risk of infection
3112887 successful education programs and other initiatives aimed at slowing the spread of hiv aids should be credited for keeping the infection rate static
3112888 but if those programs work their expansion could help to lower the infection rate especially among at risk populations
3112889 notion that those leading the national battle dont know what they are doing or are not telling the whole truth
3112890 suspicion and denial conspire to stop people from doing what is best for them getting tested and treated and stopping risky behaviors such as unprotected sex and sharing needles for drug use or tattoos or anything
3112891 clearly achieving an aids free generation in africa will call for a substantial investment of financial human and other resources
3112892 m ore importantly it will require of african governments that they muster the political will to implement the governance reforms and foster the change in political culture needed to tackle the pandemic effectively
3112893 ensur e hiv aids funding is put to its intended use
3112894 cannot be done without an investment in the health care systems of poorer countries particularly in health workers
3112895 there is a realization of late that if aids is ever going to be stopped marginalized groups
3112896 girls and women in countries where they have few rights men who have sex with men where that is taboo sex workers intravenous drug users and members of minority groups
3112897 yet for all the good intentions of the worlds scientists clinicians community workers and activists for all the grand statements about human rights the largest of the marginalized groups has been callously ignored people with disabilities
3112898 in most societies the disabled are shunned at best hidden away and pitied
3112899 there is no reason to believe that their hiv aids infection rate is any less than other groups
3112900 it is time for the aids world to open its eyes
3112901 you cant fight aids without medicine but you also cant fight aids with medicine alone
3112902 the invisible cure why we are losing the fight against aids in africa
3112903 not because africans have so many sexual partners but because african men and women are more likely than people elsewhere to have more than one long term partner at a time
3112904 even small reductions in the fraction of people with multiple sexual partners can have a dramatic effect on the epidemic
3112905 the tenaciousness of aids stems in part from the fact that measures to counter it underestimate and even ignore the human rights context in which it thrives
3112906 are also more vulnerable to hiv infection and more likely to die
3112907 any approach to hiv must also respond to the human rights issues fueling the epidemic and emanating from it
3112908 this isnt a moral issue this isnt a political debate this is a public health problem
3112909 now more than ever we need to call upon all segments of the community from civic leaders elected officials faith based institutions schools health care providers social service agencies and frankly our neighbors lets all talk about aids and about how to stop it united we can achieve that goal
3112910 if the xvii international aids conference is to have an impact on the growing aids pandemic the participants need to get their priorities straight improving medical infrastructure and lowering tariffs should be their chief concern not weakening drug patents
3112911 there is no question that african americans are disproportionately represented among the ranks of those with hiv and aids
3112912 paints a portrait of what black america would look like if it were a separate country
3112913 some worry that not enough money is being spent at home
3112914 is falling short on its commitment to curb hiv aids
3112915 we still see huge racial and economic disparities in hiv infection rates
3112916 exposed a fatal flaw in the cdc hiv aids data collection and monitoring funding allocation and prevention programs
3112917 state and federal funding for hiv prevention and aids services is less likely to reach populations who most need it
3112918 need for increased prevention services for women especially women of color has been clearly demonstrated and documented
3112919 boldly at the forefront of efforts to reduce poverty and enhance the lives of people around the world for years to come
3112920 not only investing in the prevention and treatment of hiv aids malaria and tuberculosis today but we also are focusing on tomorrow by training people to manage deliver and support the distribution of health services which will be critical for sustained successes against infectious diseases
3112921 improving the health of populations and reducing the spread and impact of diseases result in greater productivity and economic growth and contribute to peace and stability
3112922 we will save countless lives by expanding proven approaches and interventions until we reach all who are in need
3112923 the year long prelude to the beijing games has seen a major crackdown on free speech and dissent a massive sweep of undesirables from the host city and increasing abuses of ethnic minority tibetans and uighurs
3112924 i would put china in the top 10 percent of all the authoritarian states in the world
3112925 every country in the world oil states excepted with gdp topping 8 000 was at least partly free as categorized by the human rights group freedom house indeed all ranked as free except the tiny island city state of singapore
3112926 classed as belonging to the free nations of the earth
3112927 zomg did you hear about how he wuz cheetin on his wife
3112928 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare
3112929 there was a tendency fair or not to dismiss what you read in the national enquirer
3112930 what people are saying about me is made up nothingness
3112931 when properly structured it can open opportunities otherwise closed to qualified minorities without having an adverse impact on the opportunities for whites
3112932 i also support efforts to increase opportunities for qualified students from low income backgrounds to attend colleges and universities regardless of race
3112933 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3112934 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3112935 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3112936 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3112937 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3112938 you can have one glass of champagne and thats it

3112941 obviously he has good experience with that age group we have a really deep defensive corps with a lot of options to choose from which will ultimately help our team
3112942 i thought the games themselves were some of the better weve had in a few years in lake placid
3112943 the camp reaffirmed that the depth of our player pool is strong so its going to be hard to separate out a lot of guys its good news for us but were going to need some of those players to separate themselves over the course of the fall to clarify our roster
3112944 we saw certain players solidify what we felt they would bring to the team but theres still those lingering questions on how we can plug them into our lineup in december
3112945 we look at both how our guys play during the season and also factor in their performance at the camp some of those guys can confirm how they played at the camp with their season
3112946 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
3112947 our losses are mainly civilian ninety percent of our casualties are civilian
3112948 it had been 2 000 years since there was peace between egypt and a free jewish nation

3112950 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3112951 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3112979 either we find a way to respond to russias military action together or we have to live with the decision that we will face a different world tomorrow
3112980 it doesnt look like this was premeditated with a massive staging of equipment

3113080 in the last few years we have dramatically accelerated the deal sizes and went exclusively into the clean tech sector
3113081 artificially low water prices as well as lack of preferential policies from the central government mean that it doesnt make economic sense for companies to adopt costly technologies to improve water usage efficiency and re utilize wasted water at the moment

3113109 this sales growth enabled us to double our operating earnings during the second quarter as compared to the same period of 2007 although our sales and operating earnings for the second quarter were well ahead of last year our net income declined compared to 2007 due to the previously announced 329 000 write down in the value of our preferred stock holdings subsequent to the end of the quarter we liquidated our holdings of preferred stocks and corporate bonds due to continued instability in the financial markets this liquidation resulted in a further loss of approximately 420 000 which will be reflected in our third quarter results

3113137 these steps include the production cutbacks for the second half of fiscal 2008 the closure of a plant in north carolina and seven distribution centers and the consolidation of our tray pack operations in el dorado ark to six other case ready sites
3113138 with labor day approaching and no indication that the actions taken to date by pilgrims pride or other industry members are having a positive effect on selling prices for our products it is now clear that more significant decisive action is necessary in addition epas disappointing decision to reject the request for a partial waiver of the 2008 renewable fuel standard for corn based ethanol assures that high grain prices are here to stay for the foreseeable future while we had sincerely hoped to avoid further facility closures or consolidations we recognize that we must do everything in our control to pass along higher input costs we believe the actions announced today while painful are needed to position pilgrims pride to emerge from this down cycle as a much stronger more efficient competitor

3113154 consider for example the work of an artist can it properly be said that the artist is expressing himself i e literally pushing outward something that is already formed inside of him such a description is not in fact generally accurate or adequate rather what usually happens is that the first thing the artist does is only similar in certain ways to what he may have in mind as in a conversation between two people he sees the similarity and the difference and from this perception something further emerges in his next action thus something new is continually created that is common to the artist and the material on which he is working

3113795 in western culture white is beautiful because white is the color of virtue
3113796 in passing for white dramas crinkly hair or large compared to a supposed european average lips may be taken as the tell tale sign that someone is black
3113797 modern anthropology has demonstrated that racial lines are not only absolutely independent of both national and linguistic groupings but that in many cases these racial lines cut through them at sharp angels and correspond closely with the divisions of social cleavage the great lesson of the science of race is the immutability of somatological or bodily characters with which is closely associated the immutability of psychical predispositions and impulses
3113798 when stating their preferences in a mate few correspondents expressed a desire for persons with lighter complexions than they had themselves
3113799 i am not particular about color or grade of hair as the majority of the beautiful belles have proved to be dumb bells
3113800 discriminate on account of color how in blazes do they expect equality from other races when they dont even practice it among themselves

3113803 looking at any group of negroes in america especially in the north it is easy to see that while they are all essentially negroes whether coal black brown or yellow a great many of them have varying amounts of nordic blood in them which has modified their physical structure without transforming them in any way into white men this miscegenation was of course a frightful disgrace to the dominant race but its effect on the nordics has been negligible for the simple reason that it was confined to white men crossing with negro women and did not involve the reverse process which would of course have resulted in the infusion of negro blood into the american stock

3113822 with half the year now behind us we are well positioned to meet our 2008 financial targets especially considering that the second half of the year is traditionally stronger than the first half and that our backlog is higher than a year ago

3113824 we asked for savings ideas from 20 markets they came back to us with numbers
3113825 waste managements bid is in line with the 36 38 range where we think the company could execute an all cash bid for republic without issuing additional equity and maintain its investment grade debt rating
3113826 we dont expect that ever to have to be paid
3113827 republic will look at this as another hostile takeover bid and attempt to convince shareholders and its board that the allied deal provides the best growth opportunity

3113829 we are well positioned to achieve our growth targets for 2008 while continuing to provide an attractive dividend yield to our shareholders
3113830 i think peoples expectations got too high because they began to believe that these prices couldnt drop and almost the beginning of bubble mentality had taken place over the last year or so
3113831 no one knows how far prices will drop but the fact the world economy is slowing is finally getting recognized in the marketplace
3113832 however housing activity is definitely on a downward trend consistent with indications of deteriorating affordability through last year this factor is expected to keep new residential construction activity under pressure going forward our forecast assumes that starts will drop on average 5 3 per cent this year and 14 8 per cent next year

3113839 its ebays obligation once it has knowledge to take the knowledge to investigate and stop the sale of counterfeit merchandise

3113933 t he negative effects of the plaintiffs emory and microbe guard potential loss in goodwill market share and prestige are real

3113935 a very clear statement of an obligation to respond in a timely fashion under the local rules
3113936 this order specifically relies on novas failure to respond under the local rules as creating admissions that justify summary judgment
3113937 from our perspective the judges approach is interesting he chose to rely on the local rules with a very clear holding that if you fail to comply with the local rules it will result in defaults that can trigger summary judgment
3113938 has not responded to the infringement contentions in 19 months nor even responded to these motions for summary judgment likewise the court finds that the defendants complete disregard for the patent local rules at this late stage will preclude it from introducing any evidence to challenge the patents validity

3113946 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of non combatants in the buildings at that time
3113947 survivors reported that coalition aircraft dropped a bomb on the enemy position which killed eight of the civilians
3113948 an anonymous eyewitness told coalition forces that the civilians tried to escape the compound but the militants beat them and refused to let them leave
3113949 innocent civilians homes taking them by force to attack afghan and coalition forces
3113950 if civilians get killed during these attacks the responsibility falls on the taliban and their terrorist sponsors
3113951 therefore the use of air force in the war against terrorism in the afghan villages will have no result but causing civilian casualties

3114058 ciertamente que tampoco hay que restarles m rito a los rusos porque se equivocaron muy poco
3114059 siempre dije que el primer partido era clave fernando y nicol s hubiesen tomado mucho m s confianza si hubiesen ganado este partido pero les toc uno de los cuadros m s dif ciles lo cierto es que en los momentos importantes los rusos no fallaron y por ah pas el partido

3114127 it is always important to adhere to the strict time limits for bringing an appeal against an immigration decision
3114128 the issues in contention here are whether mrs koroma is unemployed and if so whether that affects her ability to meet the requirements of someone applying for a visitors visa to the uk and whether she on the balance of probabilities has demonstrated that she is seeking a uk visa as a genuine visitor
3114129 the appellant is a woman of limited means that does not mean she cannot travel i have no reason to doubt that she would return to her family as i accept that she has been here and returned previously
3114130 on the balance of probabilities and on the totality of the evidence before me i find that the appellant has discharged the burden of proof therefore the respondents decision is not in accordance with the law and the applicable immigration rules

3114212 vince come on this is incredible youve been essentially blacked out by the mainstream media and youre still a new york times best seller

3114217 this woman in question has a very interesting history knowing her as this kind of bar fly who had this kind of crazy past from reading everything i read it seemed to me that she targeted edwards
3114218 why do politicians like john edwards risk their careers by having extramarital affairs
3114219 what was the trigger so i wonder if there was something about his wifes illness that somehow got him to cheat or contributed at least
3114220 well you know i think that we get so caught up in good or bad you know is somebody a good person or a bad person cheating is wrong but i think that there are multiple factors was he doing it because he had a fear of losing his wife i mean there are lots of different reasons
3114221 no i hear that there may be legitimacy to that
3114222 its possible he couldnt stop himself in the sense you know the career of politics involves all sorts of change variety novelty risk uncertainty they tend to be natural rule breakers these the folks who go in there you know if they followed the strict rules theyd have a 9 00 to 5 00 ordinary job

3114253 we felt like the theme would be something they remembered because it is something most of them have experienced
3114254 an amusement park is all about choices from what can i eat to what can i do and that is as vast as the spiritual choices they can make they learned through a cast of characters that the choices you make sometimes arent the right ones but god will forgive you and give the choice to try another way
3114255 when charity and i were approached to think about taking on this event we were very excited because we both love working with children
3114256 we both felt like it was a great opportunity to share gods word and the bible with a whole week to focus on as much of it as we could it is a very fun way to learn but the underlying goal is to get the message across and have the kids remember it when they leave
3114257 with so many people willing to come together and share resources all for gods glory i just knew this week was going to be wonderful
3114258 our pastor wanted to be sure that the kids didnt have to choose between which program to attend and this way they could spend the whole summer at bible school and gain even more of the message we all want to share
3114259 i had the best experience this week because i know that the message was received
3114260 the kids follow me around telling me that they have learned their bible verses and want me to listen to them as they recite them also a little girl had the opportunity to go to six flags with her friend and stay in a hotel and she chose to spend the week with us instead which proves to me that god works in wonderful ways
3114261 children are visual and we are so thankful to have received the decorations from the waxahachie church
3114262 we are in turn going to donate them to a church with a limited budget so they can bring this message to another group and keep the message moving throughout the community
3114263 i was reminded that we follow a god that is bigger than we are and he made sure that we had what we needed to minister to the children and all of our volunteers have been an absolute blessing

3114385 were going to try to be constructive and try to get some finality to everything but that isnt going to happen if this matter gets dragged through the courts another two to three years
3114386 we can compromise on design on money on a lot of different things but you need people at a table to discuss it
3114387 i dont know if that is going to happen so well see
3114388 that is it they are not interested in negotiating for money

3114409 a id ia inicial era realizar um evento que pudesse representar a import ncia dos dez anos de reconhecimento da profiss o de educador f sico e 9 anivers rio da nossa gradua o
3114410 mas agora conquistamos mais uma raz o para comemorar j que o curso atingiu conceito m ximo no ltimo enade
3114411 the obstacles women face when ending a violet relationship are complex and significant
3114412 with the completion of the new safehouse weave staff and volunteers will have more resources to offer the more than 750 women and children who come to us each year we will have the tools to stop the violence and create opportunities for survivors of domestic violence
3114413 la moneda tiene que estar hecha por alguien que se dedique a ello
3114414 we had warning we knew gasoline prices would rise we watched as the emerging markets demanded more and more of the oil as a nation we did nothing as an industry we pretended that cheap oil would last forever
3114415 we had no plan to quickly import fuel efficient vehicles
3114416 there was no plan to make up the lost profit loss caused by the rapid drop in suv and truck sales
3114417 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
3114418 but john mccain is four more years of george w bush
3114419 the danger from iran is grave it is real and my goal will be to eliminate this threat
3114420 let there be no doubt i will always keep the threat of military action on the table to defend our security and our ally israel sometimes there are no alternatives to confrontation
3114421 michael moore is a supporter of yours and has endorsed you but in his new book mikes election guide he says the following go ahead and fill in the blank ive provided a full list of outrageously offensive lines already taken out of context in advance to make it easy for rightwing commentators and fox news will you still accept his endorsement or do you denounce him
3114422 segern satt som en murare i v ggen negern satt p en stol breve
3114423 all crimes have to be fixed and be analysed later
3114424 we received very reliable information that the russians decided to move towards gori thats why we decided to pull out all our troops and to relocate them to defend tbilisi
3114425 we are right now driving through the town and i see no trace of troops or military vehicles it is absolutely deserted
3114426 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3114427 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3114428 russia of course will take its peacekeeping mission to a logical conclusion we will strive for working relations with all participants of this conflict
3114429 russian peacekeepers and support units are carrying out an operation aimed at preventing georgian forces from regrouping to carry new attacks on south ossetia senaki is one of the places where such actions were underway
3114430 this provocation was aimed at occupying south ossetia abkhazia and then all of georgia
3114431 the eu grand strategy is to develop georgia as an alternative route for caspian oil and gas by bypassing russia
3114432 but if georgia is no longer a safe passageway then all of these schemes for diminished dependency on russia go up in smoke
3114433 the first significant break in russias previous monopoly control over all oil and natural gas from the caspian sea states
3114434 azerbaijan and georgia for example rely on this pipeline for the political independence they often act out
3114435 an alternative pathway for the flow of caspian oil and gas to the west
3114436 georgia has been one of the leading recipients of u s military aid ever since
3114437 this of course infuriated the russians and they determined to try to curb georgias ties to the west in any way they possibly could
3114438 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3114439 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3114440 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3114441 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3114442 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3114443 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3114444 wherein on the basis of serbias moral responsibility for the events of june 28 the murder of the archduke franz ferdinand certain demands would be addressed to her for the suppression in future of great serb propaganda
3114445 it is altogether difficult to foresee the effect which any one political action may produce abroad
3114446 two principles were in sharp conflict the maintenance of austria as a conglomerate of various nationalities and the rise of independent national states claiming their ethnic territories from austria hungary for this reason and not with a view to expiating the murder of franz ferdinand austria hungary had to go to war against serbia
3114447 we consider that that the latest developments such as the crossing of the georgian borders by russian troops changed the dimension of he conflict we therefore call upon russia to stop immediately all military activity on georgian territory
3114448 we are providing through this funding of one million euros in areas such as basic emergency shelter tents for example or food or water and sanitation all these issues need to be dealt with when you have populations on the move
3114449 an application may extend an extensible context group by adding terms

3114478 if we play like we played this week well beat australia
3114479 this is a very exciting stage but a starting stage
3114480 the key is to turn up to every single test match like we turned up to this one with the structures and the players weve got the type of attack weve had in this game the way weve gone about the game and the way weve been up for it every single day and the emotions that the guys have come out with its not far away from a perfect start its the way we want to play our cricket in the future
3114481 ive been doing a lot of thinking over the last five days and ive definitely done a bit of thinking about australia next year
3114482 certainly a lot more than i would have if i was a player its about getting the structure right for a long amount of time so the players can feel comfortable and know their role and deliver i think thats very important over the next nine months for the boys to learn their roles and deliver next year
3114483 its been a good fun five days and ive got a real happy tiredness
3114484 its about that excitement at the start but i want to be a guy who talks to the players and they think yeah he really truly wants me to do well here its important to have that relationship with your players and your coach where you really want to perform for each other and you know theyll do anything on the planet for you its a recipe for success
3114485 big steve came back in after a time out and he was magnificent
3114486 i said to stevey when i told him he was playing i want you open i want you to bowl fast and straight and bowl like the old steve harmison he said hed do his best and his best was good enough
3114487 hes a huge player absolutely huge and weve seen this week how important he is for us
3114488 im going to be looking after steve as best i can but also looking to get the best out of him as well i think now hes experienced international cricket again which he loves and with the smile hes got now im definitely going to get the best out of him
3114489 it would be lovely to have him coming in first change with the white ball but you dont always get what you want in life
3114490 this was an extremely distressing case for both myself and the landlord of the property
3114491 i cannot begin to understand how anyone could have done what miss henwood did i hope the sentence will prevent any further animals from suffering in future
3114492 ho visto una squadra carica e motivata e questo mi fa ben sperare mutu un animale da gara
3114493 mutu negli ultimi giorni pu aver dato limpressione di non essere al top ma lui un animale da gara si far trovare pronto cos come il nostro pubblico scender in campo con noi e ci dar una grande mano
3114494 chiedo ordine equilibrio tattico e spirito di combattivit voglio una squadra che non improvvisi ma che ricerchi situazione conosciute e poi non dobbiamo pensare che la partita finisca al novantesimo questo lerrore principale che potremmo commettere
3114495 lo slavia e una squadra temibile ha corsa e buona organizzazione a centrocampo fanno dei movimenti particolari ci vorr attenzione e se hanno vinto il campionato vuol dire che hanno una mentalit vincente
3114496 le condizioni del campo non sono buone e un aspetto che mi preoccupa per gamberini decideremo subito dopo lallenamento sulla formazione non dico altro vogliamo giocarci bene tutte le mosse che abbiamo a disposizione parlare di chi giocher potrebbe essere un vantaggio per gli avversari
3114497 la fiorentina una grande squadra anche a livello europeo non a caso lanno scorso arrivata alla semifinale di coppa uefa e questestate si rafforzata ulteriormente sul mercato insomma sar dura ma lo slavia praga far di tutto per evitare dimostrazioni di forza da parte degli avversari cercheremo un risultato che ci tenga in corsa anche per la partita di ritorno chi temo tra i viola gli attaccanti gilardino mutu e santana ma anche kuzmanovic un buon centrocampista

3114499 there are simultaneous manifestations of severe injustice in india today such as appalling levels of continued child undernourishment lack of entitlement to basic education and medical attention of the poorer members of the society whatever else nyaya may demand and we can have all sorts of different views of what a perfectly just india would look like the reasoned humanity of the justice of nyaya can hardly fail to demand the urgent removal of these terrible deprivations in human lives
3114500 to think more clearly about what should be done we have to ask what should keep us awake at night
3114501 in probing the idea of social justice it is important to distinguish between an arrangement focused view of justice and a realisation focused understanding of justice sometimes justice is conceptualised in terms of certain organisational arrangements some institutions some regulations some behavioural rules the active presence of which indicates that justice is being done
3114502 a realization focused understanding of justice broadens the evaluation of justice to the assessment of the actual world that emerges which includes most importantly the lives that the people involved are able to lead

3114529 yo no estoy en pol tica para hacer lo que dicen las encuestas estoy en pol tica para cambiarlas as lo hemos hecho en muchas ocasiones hay muchos senadores de la udi que han triunfado cuando no hab a ninguna encuesta que les daba esa opci n
3114530 por lo tanto en el mes de abril la udi va a volver a sorprender a todos los chilenos no tengo ninguna duda somos el partido m s grande y tenemos la capacidad para levantar muchas opciones presidenciales o para tomar caminos distintos
3114531 se ve a venir se hab a hablado mucho del tema y de lo que se trata es que todos los jugadores chilenos que est n actuado de buena forma en el extranjero se integren a la selecci n para que se haga m s fuerte y mantener viva la ilusi n de poder llegar a sud frica
3114532 son se ales importantes todo jugador que llegue a la selecci n tiene que adquirir un compromiso no solo en lo deportivo sino en lo humano en lo personal y me parece fant stico su retorno porque el equipo se hace m s fuerte
3114533 es un rival con el que chile tiene una buena posibilidad de saber en que punto se encuentra de cara a los pr ximos partidos clasificatorios creo que turqu a ya no es una sorpresa porque tiene muy buenos jugadores es una bonita oportunidad para que chile haga un buen partido
3114534 lo peor en estas situaciones en que se disputan territorios el lado m s oscuro de esto es la cantidad de v ctimas que ocurren y que son personas absolutamente inocentes
3114535 por lo tanto hacemos un llamamiento a que en forma definitiva se escoja el camino del di logo y no el que hemos visto en estos d as
3114536 we forgot about it and were putting it in right now
3114537 todo jugador que llega a otra competencia le cuesta adaptarse lo vemos en la u donde varios jugadores fueron criticados y ahora son s per alabados a todo le cuesta pero ac macnelly tiene toda la confianza de nosotros del cuerpo t cnico he conversado con el y est muy a gusto y lo nico que quiere es rendir de a poco tomara el nivel que lo hizo merecedor de venir a un club grande y de estar en la selecci n
3114538 el tiene todo el apoyo de nosotros y del t cnico que lo est haciendo a jugar hasta que se adapte saben de la capacidad que puede ganar un partido solo pero hay que esperar tenemos fe en l confianza y sabemos que va a explotar para llevar a colo colo por el camino que se merece

3114561 there are also in georgia about 1 600 collective centers hosting some 100 000 internally displaced already there is some room in those we are also ready to provide temporary shelter if needed as well as the basic non food items such as the blankets that will be brought in jerry cans kitchen sets and so on
3114562 the situation is still very volatile and we estimate that many people need help and many are seeking safety elsewhere
3114563 therefore it is essential that unhcr and other humanitarian agencies are able to reach the affected and the displaced and that those who are indeed trapped in the conflict areas are granted passage to safer areas as soon as possible it is also absolutely essential that both sides respect humanitarian principles and ensure the protection and safety of civilians

3114579 without full control the full 100 percent of executive power in morgans hands it is worthless the mdc should be very careful what they accept now because they will find out in due course that there is little they will be able to do with anything less in political partnership with mugabe

3114587 we are carefully watching how western media is covering the events
3114588 it is very unusual that the financial times has stepped aside from its usual balanced reporting over the past few days
3114589 most of the western press supports georgia in the conflict and accuses russia of trying to annex foreign territory
3114590 the west is kind of spreading propaganda against russia this is not a case of russia being overly aggressive
3114591 if journalists have already discovered who the guilty parties are then public opinion is not nearly so straightforward
3114592 it is as clear as day that the u s is supporting georgia and propping them up both with money and on tv they the united states are blaming russia for something we did not do
3114593 objectivity is not a typical trait of some western journalists
3114594 saakashvili was put there by the americans by american money he is being paid by the americans and america is funding this conflict

3114636 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3114637 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3114638 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3114639 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3114640 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3114641 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
3114642 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
3114643 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
3114644 we just dont have as much money as we used to
3114645 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
3114646 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
3114647 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
3114648 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
3114649 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
3114650 we are not staying home with our children by default
3114651 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
3114652 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
3114653 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
3114654 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
3114655 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
3114656 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year
3114657 to find a job that pays something decent i would still have to drive an hour each way at 4 30 a gallon
3114658 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible
3114659 how can we justify eating out when we could go to a store and buy enough for a couple days worth of meals
3114660 theres just no time to regroup none left for ourselves
3114661 saya tidak menyangka bisa menang melawan pemain denmark mengingat secara peringkat saya berada di bawah dia tine juga merupakan salah satu unggulan peraih medali di olimpiade
3114662 saya mencoba untuk bermain semampu saya mengingat saya sudah tiga kali tampil dalam olimpiade 2008 ini sementara dia rasmussen baru sekali ini
3114663 saya tidak memainkan bulutangkis terbaik saya hari ini mungkin paling banyak hanya 80 persen dari kekuatan saya saya merasa sedikit kaku karena ini olimpiade dan saya terlalu banyak berharap pada diri saya sendiri
3114664 lolosnya saya ke babak berikutnya sebenarnya sudah melampaui target karena saya sadar lawan yang saya hadapi berat berat
3114665 lawan berikutnya yang akan saya hadapi tentunya akan lebih berat sehingga pada pertandingan kedua diharapkan grafiknya bisa lebih ditingkatkan

3114680 the economy continues to worsen and we must make the painful choice to reduce expenses further
3114681 we may limit the number of voluntary applications we accept given business needs or to ensure that no one area of the operation is unfairly impacted
3114682 we will evaluate the number of employees leaving under the voluntary program how work will be streamlined reallocated and consolidated and what additional expense reductions may still be necessary then we will determine if additional staff reductions must be made through an involuntary severance program

3114704 i like the fact he won the british open and came back after having a down spell in his career and won those two tournaments in that one year i saw a lot of heart in ben curtis
3114705 ben has got that kind of demeanor we need on the ryder cup team
3114706 hes a little more stoic a little more subdued but i like his personality hes the type of guy thats going to just put his head down and barrel on
3114707 even though they won five of the last six somehow they just seem to come in as the underdogs i dont know how that works this time i think its clear we are the underdogs

3114710 riquelme e aguero s o dois jogadores importantes uma quest o complicada esta dos cart es amarelos e por isso tenho pensado em d los um descanso para que joguem as quartas de final
3114711 uma possibilidade vamos ver como est o os jogadores amanh e a decidiremos a equipe
3114712 sou o primeiro candidato negro a prefeito da minha cidade
3114713 n o foi uma estrat gia de marketing planejada mas essa id ia tem trazido um efeito positivo para a gente
3114714 foi uma jogada de marketing a id ia pegou est na boca do povo
3114715 disseram que eu agora tenho liga es com o pessoal do oriente m dio tenho que fazer um trabalho did tico para mostrar que n o nada disso
3114716 vi um livro sobre a trajet ria dele um negro pobre e simples que virou senador meu objetivo tamb m chegar l ao topo presid ncia
3114717 my visit left me even more deeply convinced that we not only have a moral obligation to help displaced iraqi families but also a serious long term national security interest in ending this crisis
3114718 actually we dont disagree as much as youd think i think people assume im a democrat but im registered independent and im still undecided so im looking at mccain as well as obama
3114719 como si a las discogr ficas se les exigiera decir el punto donde esta el mantero con la manta para que la polic a vaya a decomisar la mercanc a ilegal y detener al delincuente
3114720 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3114721 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3114722 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3114723 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3114724 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3114725 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3114726 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3114727 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3114728 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3114729 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3114730 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3114731 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3114732 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3114733 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3114734 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3114735 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3114736 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3114737 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3114738 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3114739 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3114740 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3114741 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3114742 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3114743 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3114744 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3114745 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3114746 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3114747 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3114748 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3114749 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3114750 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3114751 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3114752 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3114753 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3114754 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3114755 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3114756 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
3114757 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
3114758 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
3114759 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
3114760 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
3114761 juntando a nova constitui o pol tica do estado com os estatutos aut nomos
3114762 se sentar para chegar a acordos sobre os assuntos fundamentais para o pa s
3114763 est o brincando com o pa s na beira do abismo
3114764 ser amos cegos em n o reconhecer uma vit ria do presidente e nesse sentido agora mais do que nunca preciso sentar mesa do di logo e o primeiro passo tem que ser dado pelo governo
3114765 falta de credibilidade na palavra do governo que nunca a cumpriu
3114766 i feel sorry for people who dont drink when they wake up in the morning thats the best theyre going to feel all day
3114767 estou satisfeito com a redu o da infla o em particular de todos os ndices de atacado e de varejo
3114768 significa que o processo de alta das commodities est sendo revertido o que vai fazer com que a infla o caminhe mais rapidamente para o centro da meta no futuro
3114769 o governo continuar empenhado em controlar a infla o porque ela sempre pode voltar e se difundir
3114770 estamos fazendo um bom super vit mas se necess rio for o super vit prim rio uma excelente arma para combater a infla o porque diminui o disp ndio p blico e ajuda a segurar a demanda agregada
3114771 the aim is to provide a modern service for the city
3114772 the future vision for the library service in belfast is available on our website
3114773 we hope our demonstrations at ardoyne and ballymacarrett will create a greater awareness to library users of these closure plans and we encourage members of the public to attend our demonstrations
3114774 while we recognise the difficult financial position of library services at present we are opposed to these proposals as they remove services from some of the most socially deprived areas in belfast
3114775 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3114776 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3114777 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3114778 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3114779 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3114780 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3114781 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
3114782 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
3114783 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
3114784 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
3114785 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
3114786 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
3114787 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
3114788 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
3114789 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
3114790 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
3114791 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
3114792 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3114793 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
3114794 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
3114795 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
3114796 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3114797 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3114798 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3114799 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3114800 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3114801 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3114802 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3114803 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3114804 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3114805 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3114806 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3114807 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3114808 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3114809 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
3114810 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
3114811 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
3114812 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
3114813 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
3114814 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
3114815 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3114816 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3114817 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

3114822 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3114823 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another

3114825 vamos acertar algumas situa es no treino de hoje segunda feira para fazer o melhor em casa e buscar os tr s pontos o grupo est confiante j que viemos de um resultado positivo a equipe ser definida durante a atividade mas s vou divulgar antes do jogo

3114828 lo que dice la sentencia es que se tienen que eliminar los contenidos previa identificaci n suficiente de telecinco lo que dice el auto no es una cosa diferente a la pol tica normal que tenemos lo que te dice la ley es que tiene que ser una autoridad competente quien identifique pero nosotros lo hacemos independientemente de que sea un juez quien nos lo ha dictado ofrecemos este servicio de forma gratuita y con tener las url de los videos se eliminan autom ticamente
3114829 mucho m s all de lo que implica la ley
3114830 se eliminan todos los v deos que solicite el due o de los derechos lo que no podemos hacer es eliminar unilateralmente los v deos porque podemos cometer errores borrar videos de terceros y alienar los derechos de otros propietarios y otros usuarios
3114831 un uso un poco complicado de la justicia casi un abuso
3114832 youtube es una oportunidad y no una amenaza como han demostrado todos los partners y el resto de socios con los que estamos trabajando
3114833 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
3114834 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
3114835 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
3114836 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
3114837 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
3114838 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
3114839 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3114840 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3114841 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3114842 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3114843 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3114844 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3114845 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3114846 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3114847 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3114848 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3114849 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3114850 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
3114851 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
3114852 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
3114853 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3114854 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3114855 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3114856 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3114857 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3114858 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3114859 when i first entered the market as an english teacher i was one of 120 candidates
3114860 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
3114861 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
3114862 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
3114863 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
3114864 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
3114865 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
3114866 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
3114867 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
3114868 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
3114869 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
3114870 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
3114871 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3114872 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3114873 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3114874 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
3114875 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
3114876 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
3114877 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
3114878 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
3114879 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
3114880 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3114881 dort schaut es erb rmlich aus es war bekannt dass da keine normalen zust nde herrschen
3114882 what was georgia thinking when they initiated an attack they knew would result in military action
3114883 really georgia attack an area filled with separatist ethnic russians really

3114891 wir wissen nicht mehr wo f r die russischen invasoren die grenze ist russland will anscheinend die demokratisch gew hlte regierung von georgien st rzen und das land okkupieren
3114892 dies ist ein versuch georgien v llig zu erobern und zu zerst ren

3114899 a mi esposo le llego un e mail diciendo que cuiden a sus hijas porque andan unos deprabados adjuntaba un video del cual no pude tan siquiera terminar de ver
3114900 im not too happy about it i mean i shouldnt have been there in the state that i was in but i wasnt really thinking there would be someone driving past with a video camera on the roof filming me either
3114901 what do you do when you lose a mate like that you know
3114902 i know what he would have done if i left he would have partied too thats what i would have wanted him to do so thats what we did
3114903 the stanford corporate centre and the telos fitness center buildings with their excellent location and huge growth potential will undoubtedly continue to be one of dallas most valuable and viable commercial properties for years to come
3114904 senti ma per caso quando hai messo le mani nel computer hai fatto qualcosa perch oggi mi si guastato
3114905 i didnt bring it into the courts mr gore brought it into the courts
3114906 richard nixon when he lost to john f kennedy thought that the election had been stolen in chicago which was very likely true with the system at the time
3114907 but he did not even think about bringing a court challenge that was his prerogative so if you dont like the courts getting involved talk to mr gore
3114908 bear in mind that the issue wasnt whether or not the election was going to be decided by a court or not it was whether it was going to be decided by the florida court or by the united states supreme court for a federal election
3114909 i mean one side or the other was going to feel that was a politicized decision but that goes with the territory
3114910 i dont think our legal system should be that complex i think that any system that requires that many of the countrys best minds and they are the best minds is too complex
3114911 if you look at the figures where does the top of the class in college go to it goes into law they dont go into teaching now i love the law there is nothing i would rather do but it doesnt produce anything
3114912 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3114913 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3114914 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

3114940 acuso a los l deres georgianos de limpieza tnica porque su meta pol tica era eliminar a la poblaci n una nfima poblaci n de osetia del sur porque sin ella es imposible reintegrar a osetia del sur a georgia
3114941 como resultado de lo que ha ocurrido ahora estoy totalmente seguro de que una negociaci n pol tica digo entre georgia y osetia del sur jam s ser una realidad en las pr ximas d cadas

3114944 esa fue la opci n esa fue la decisi n y no tuvimos otra alternativa
3114945 pero estoy seguro de que regresar n porque de hecho en la historia reciente en el siglo pasado los georgianos han llevado a cabo genocidio y limpieza tnica en dos ocasiones en los siglos xvix y xx este fue el tercer intento de aniquilar de eliminar por completo a los ciudadanos de osetia del sur de su territorio
3114946 a t tulo personal no creo que estados unidos haya alentado directamente al presidente saakashvili a atacar y masacrar a miles de personas no lo creo
3114947 quiz eso le dio a saakashvili la impresi n equivocada de que cualquier cosa que hiciera ser a aguantado por la comunidad internacional y por ee uu en particular

3114973 weve had to go out and bring in business by nationally expanding our sales base
3114974 theyve done a good job of blending new residential areas with established industry too
3114975 and we feel really safe here really secure we feel like its the best neighborhood in all of detroit
3114976 with this new process we are reducing the travel distance of a space vehicle from 12 000 feet to 10 000 feet
3114977 we are really excited about this new build process for space vehicles and its impressive results and our air force customer is pleased to have the gps spacecraft used for this new process
3114978 with 12 satellites on order the gps program is ideal for a manufacturing pulse line because similar satellites can easily adapt to a process that mirrors mass production
3114979 the value of a pulse line is that it increases efficiency and therefore enables us to reduce costs as we continue to simplify our satellite designs in order to standardize the items that are inherent in every spacecraft built by boeing the implementation of a pulse line will yield tremendous benefits in the areas of efficiency and cost savings
3114980 we absolutely wanted to stay in campus martius and to upgrade our facility
3114981 we wanted to be in that class a building its really strategically located theres so much traffic this is our main office branch
3114982 for the motorcities national heritage area we want to show the michigan state fairgrounds for what it represents from an auto heritage point of view
3114983 they are a completely unique design inspired by the citys automotive heritage
3114984 they were processed in the same way that auto parts would be manufactured
3114985 our intention is to install them as homes are rehabbed or built in the neighborhood
3114986 ideally wed do another pressing for future development in the neighborhood
3114987 were in pretty good shape its short term expense is perhaps a little bit more but in the long run we get twice as much usage
3114988 we have not ruled out every known species but we have looked at those species known to live in that area
3114989 there are so many reports of yeti like beasts across south and central asia that i would not be surprised if there are still some pockets of these very very rare and shy creatures
3114990 we would welcome more tourists but we dont want to lie to them in the name of the mande burung
3114991 i believe 100 per cent there is something i will not say it is mande burung because we have not found it but as long as there is no proof we will keep looking
3114992 there are many stories in our myths about elves or whatever but the mande burung is not part of that folklore
3114993 the creature was on the rock he was playing with a stone hitting it against the rock it was black
3114994 it was just a few seconds that i saw it i was very scared
3114995 we are not going to give up until we find it
3114996 la gente tiene definitivamente un prejuicio contra los creyentes en la tierra plana
3114997 muchos usan el t rmino creer en la tierra plana como una forma abusiva y con connotaciones que implican fe ciega ignorancia o incluso contra el intelecto
3114998 alguna literatura sobre el tema de la sociedad de la tierra plana hace algunos a os
3114999 me di cuenta de lo mucho que aceptamos como un hecho dado los humanos parecemos felices simplemente aceptando lo que se nos dice no importa que ello sea contrario a nuestros sentidos
3115000 la tierra es plana y horizontalmente infinita y se estira horizontalmente sin cesar
3115001 y tiene al menos 9 000 kil metros de profundidad
3115002 la tierra es m s o menos un disco obviamente no es perfectamente plana debido al fen meno geol gico de colinas y valles tiene cerca de 39 840 kil metros de di metro
3115003 hay miles de seguidores pero sin una plataforma para comunicarnos contarlos uno por uno es casi imposible
3115004 las agencias espaciales del mundo est n involucradas en una conspiraci n internacional para enga ar al p blico en su propio beneficio
3115005 esa es tal vez una de las preguntas m s comunes
3115006 un r pido examen del mapa de la tierra plana explica bien la raz n el polo norte es central y la ant rtica comprende la circunferencia total de la tierra circunnavegar es un tipo de viaje en un amplio c rculo a trav s de la superficie de la tierra
3115007 como regla no tenemos ning n miedo de los aviones o de otros medios de transporte
3115008 la teor a de la tierra plana es la teor a de la conspiraci n por excelencia
3115009 naturalmente los creyentes en la tierra plana piensan que los aterrizajes en la luna fueron falsificados al igual que las fotograf as de la tierra desde el espacio
3115010 siempre es bueno preguntarnos c mo sabemos lo que nosotros sabemos pero es tambi n bueno tener la capacidad de aceptar la evidencia convincente como las fotograf as de la tierra desde el espacio
3115011 before john mccains tour of duty in vietnam he married carol shepp a model from philadelphia on his 23rd bombing mission over north vietnam in 1967 mccain was shot down and captured
3115012 left her 4 inches shorter and on crutches and she had gained a good deal of weight
3115013 in 1979 at a military reception in honolulu mccain met cindy hensley an attractive 25 year old woman from a very wealthy politically connected arizona family cindys father jim founded the hensley and company the nations third largest anheuser busch distributor
3115014 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love
3115015 hillary clinton should take on obama in denver on the convention floor whats she got to lose nada
3115016 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3115017 a sudden feeling of fear or anxiety that comes on suddenly is overwhelming appears to be uncontrollable and may seem to be unfounded
3115018 we already have two convoys that have departed and i think there is a third that may be underway
3115019 apparently 170 private american citizens have been evacuated via those official convoys
3115020 could ralph naders entrance and exit have helped al gore the impact of decoy dynamics on consumer choice
3115021 we found that the entrance and exit of a third option the nader effect can profoundly impact consumers preference
3115022 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favorite even if they werent before
3115023 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3115024 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice
3115025 in terms of elections even a 5 percent increase in preference makes a huge difference at the ballot box
3115026 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3115027 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3115028 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3115029 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3115030 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3115031 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3115032 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3115033 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3115034 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3115035 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap

3115051 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3115052 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3115053 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3115054 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3115055 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
3115056 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
3115057 the fact that bush gave you zero evidence can not be denied
3115058 pentagon oks over 10 billion in arms sales for iraq
3115059 two thirds of the raw sewage produced in the capital flows untreated into rivers and waterway
3115060 pictures of ronald reagan you can debate whether ronald reagan was good or bad but the point is everything he said he stood for is being put to the sword by george bush but i wont even have that debate with you george bush is a puppet i refuse to live in this false reality with you the country is dying weve been de industrialized weve been strip mined politically economically and spiritually
3115061 i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogue of satan
3115062 how can you instil democracy when your political position is that of indiscriminate warfare
3115063 admiral mullen us will stand by israel for next 1 000 years
3115064 heaven wont take marines and hell is afraid theyll take over
3115065 this isnt golf we dont get a do over we cant let this president wage war and kill more people in violation of international law and violation of the geneva convention his conduct is in violation of the nuremberg principles we need to hold him to account and if we do that there wont be an attack on iran
3115066 laura and i are having the time of our lives its going to be a perfect day im in a great mood
3115067 i will not go away i will not turn off the camera we are in public are you worried perhaps about the criminal liability of being a partner to mass murder after the fact you know that is a real concern because the truth is coming out
3115068 they will see every piece of evidence that goes to the finder of fact whether classified or not i want to make that very clear
3115069 taliban fighters are guilty of nothing but standing in defense of the innocent victims of 911
3115070 the taliban may have been a lot of things but they werent corrupt
3115071 as nazi tanks crossed into poland in 1939 an american senator declared lord if only i could have talked to hitler all of this might have been avoided we have an obligation to call this what it is the false comfort of appeasement which has been repeatedly discredited by history
3115072 fuck your god fuck yo mama and double fuck yourself
3115073 i want the iranians to know that if im the president we will attack iran
3115074 the next 9 11 will make the last 9 11 pale in comparison
3115075 as the bullets began to fly the blood sprayed from between her eyes and then i laughed maniacally
3115076 zionists believe israel should not be defended from war criminals who bomb jewish communities indiscriminately to murder children with millions of landmines
3115077 you could almost see their dicks getting hard as they got new ideas
3115078 this barbarous act has no place among civilized peoples and shocks the conscience of all peace loving nations there is no cause that could ever justify this action
3115079 the politicians that we vote for wont stay and fight and they wont count the votes
3115080 the world should respect any action taken by ungodly zionist evil israel in order to defend its citizens
3115081 i grabbed her little sister and put her in front of me as the bullets began to fly the blood sprayed from between her eyes and then i laughed maniacally
3115082 the mass murdered unarmed innocent neighbors back door was open
3115083 it amounts to collective punishment and is contrary to international humanitarian law
3115084 more than 250 torture victims come forward to sue caci
3115085 our government has no power except that granted it by the people
3115086 the pentagon is seeking executions of innocent torture victims who allege they did every last terrorist act of the last 50 years
3115087 ron pauls name crossed out on new york ballot papers
3115088 are traffic lights an effective way to improve traffic congestion
3115089 so there you have it we torture consider it legal
3115090 he claims to be a follower of the torah of moses but as far as i know the torah prohibits oppression and prohibits injustice and prohibits stealing peoples land and property
3115091 the attack will be spectacular and designed to inflict mass casualties against u s facilities or interests attack preparations have been made attack will occur with little or no warning
3115092 anything that moves you kill and dont take any prisoners
3115093 if the defense version of events is true dismissal of the charge is justified
3115094 lance corporal tatum entered a home and participated in the killing of iraqis who were not legitimate targets then entered a second home and participated in the murder of more innocent women and children
3115095 the marines have landed and we now as enron own a piece of afghanistan
3115096 it is not george bush it is not the neocons
3115097 i just want to point out that were going to encourage the people to look at the evidence for themselves
3115098 those who negotiate in the name of the taliban will be killed
3115099 if the absence of violence is victory no one will ever win
3115100 it is not george bush it is not the neocons
3115101 this document does not purport to provide a prosecutable case against usama bin laden in a court of law
3115102 and at this juncture we are able to perform professional no notice inspections all over iraq and to increase aerial surveillance
3115103 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3115104 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3115105 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3115106 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3115107 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3115108 in anticipation of this agreement a conservative revenue estimate of 400 000 was included in the fiscal year 2009 adopted budget which will fund solid waste fund programs and activities as well as recent staff changes approved by city council
3115109 although the siting of a local materials recovery facility was not pursued beyond the feasibility study the idea of sharing revenues from commingled recyclables survived
3115110 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
3115111 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
3115112 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
3115113 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
3115114 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
3115115 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
3115116 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
3115117 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3115118 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3115119 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3115120 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3115121 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3115122 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3115123 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3115124 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3115125 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3115126 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3115127 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3115128 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3115129 the wall street journal gets a gigantic miss for taking at face value the recent actions of moqtada al sadr rather than a surrender i think his recent actions are the start of hezbollah south with strong support from iran the real nature of transformation will become apparent once the united states troops are withdrawn
3115130 we simply wont allow you to go to kuanjie church today if you say you will go there again we will break your legs
3115131 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
3115132 ralph nader is not a protest candidate he is not for sale and neither is my vote
3115133 i am not voting for a third party or a third person nor is my vote a protest vote and obama has the support of democrats not necessarily liberals liberals like myself are backing ralph nader
3115134 third or fourth party presidential candidates could garner enough votes in november to make a difference in some of the hotly contested swing states
3115135 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq
3115136 the war under post nuremburg laws is a criminal war of aggression its illegal we have no right as a nation to debate the terms of the occupation we have no right to be there
3115137 a few things we wont tolerate personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
3115138 personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
3115139 campaigns and parties often use dirty tricks to suppress the vote
3115140 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3115141 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3115142 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3115143 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3115144 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3115145 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3115146 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3115147 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3115148 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3115149 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3115150 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3115151 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3115152 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3115153 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3115154 whats happening is that flooding events are all of a sudden not being labeled 50 year floods anymore
3115155 prior to that i hadnt heard anybody talking about it in the community
3115156 its more something you think that older people should take care of for us
3115157 a tasty foot long hero roll piled high with good meat and cheese at a very reasonable price be very hungry or save half for later my
3115158 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
3115159 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
3115160 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
3115161 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
3115162 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members

3115164 a mutually faithful monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected standard of human sexual activity
3115165 bearing children out of wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child the childs parents and society
3115166 do not provide information of a kind usable by non heterosexuals to prevent disease
3115167 little use to non heterosexual students who may aspire to parenting but lack the prospect of a legally sanctioned marriage

3115171 russian troops are currently disarming the surrounded georgian forces in south ossetia
3115172 we have eliminated the possibility of an aerial threat from georgia in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
3115173 we did not bomb georgias oil pipelines if we had done this oil spills and possible oil fires could have led to a regional environmental disaster
3115174 the eu grand strategy is to develop georgia as an alternative route for caspian oil and gas by bypassing russia
3115175 but if georgia is no longer a safe passageway then all of these schemes for diminished dependency on russia go up in smoke
3115176 the first significant break in russias previous monopoly control over all oil and natural gas from the caspian sea states
3115177 azerbaijan and georgia for example rely on this pipeline for the political independence they often act out
3115178 an alternative pathway for the flow of caspian oil and gas to the west
3115179 georgia has been one of the leading recipients of u s military aid ever since
3115180 this of course infuriated the russians and they determined to try to curb georgias ties to the west in any way they possibly could
3115181 is currently in a state of physical and financial disrepair
3115182 the utilities commission is barely able to pay for the fuel oil needed to power its generators as a result the island of saipan experiences multiple power outages daily
3115183 most of the 8 000 plus gallons of rydlyme acquired between 1998 and 2000 was never used by cuc and over 1 400 gallons remain in storage on the island of rota
3115184 five transactions took place over the ensuing two years all of which were less than circumvented procurement regulations and ignored explicit conflict of interest statutes
3115185 to fast track and sole source yet another agreement to buy rydlyme this time from a company called blue pacific
3115186 as with the first five transactions the sixth transaction entailed a mark up of approximately 400 percent over cost
3115187 we are ready for school i know the importance of being prepared and how it feels because i am a teacher myself and i know what it is like for the students to feel unprepared for the first day of school
3115188 having my daughter prepared for school gives her teacher a break
3115189 my kids and i were busy all summer long but i managed to get everything over and done with so i dont have to feel stressed since i am done with all my back to school errands i got to relax and take my kids fishing before school opens
3115190 the shop has been busy since last week especially on the weekends when the parents arent working
3115191 some parents bring three to five kids just to get their back to school hair cut
3115192 dont forget your list of supplies so you dont have to make two or more trips
3115193 start off purchasing the basic supplies such as notebooks paper pens and pencils then wait till teachers are done with all their add ons to complete your shopping
3115194 i found the school orientation very helpful in terms of what we can expect for the beginning of the year
3115195 my sons have the basic supplies and we are going to hold off on the other supplies until the teachers give out their syllabus
3115196 i wish i could say i was surprised but i am really not because in the condition that gpss is in there are really going to be problems in all the schools
3115197 unless someone says something is wrong no one is going to take action to fix it
3115198 i feel like ive kind of been gypped for the last few years ive been through this double session thing for three years so i have been ripped off on half the instructional time i could have gotten
3115199 we are committed to making sure all the schools are open by aug 12
3115200 weve worked seven days a week all the resources of the executive branch have been brought to bear to help assist the schools and it has not just been us its been a community effort including many of our staff including myself who have volunteered to get the schools open
3115201 it cannot be overlooked that military commands the private sector all the agencies in the government and all the school communities have come out in force to make sure these schools were open
3115202 when we opened the schools today we will see a lot of smiling faces a lot of kids ready to go back to learning and all the work that was done in recent weeks was for that moment
3115203 for those that arent going to be back in school based on gpsss decision to delay in two days they will be doing the same thing too
3115204 im so disappointed i feel like ive failed i really wanted them all open

3115208 the chair was just a mess and at a time when you really need a good nights rest
3115209 this is wonderful because there is such a tradition of giving in our community

3115211 the technique is for someone who has had cataract surgery where a cloudy lens was taken out of the eye and was replaced with an artificial lens

3115213 doctors in guam are receiving the attention that they finally deserve
3115214 im only one of several doctors on guam who publish and print material so guam has good doctors here and they are at the cutting edge of their specialties in many cases patients dont have to fly off to the mainland or anywhere else to receive good care
3115215 i would say that to actually have access to a doctor that really practices at a high level of care a level that is up there with the most modern care of anyone in the world and the fact that he actually has been recognized by the main retinal society in the world thats kind of cool
3115216 to strengthen promote and enhance the professional practice of health promotion and public health education nationally and within state health departments
3115217 we made some stupid mistakes and i wish i could take them back but obviouosly i cant
3115218 phil was making uncharacteristic errors ive not seen him make in two years
3115219 absolutely nothing went our way so were going to have to take care of business
3115220 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
3115221 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3115222 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3115223 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3115224 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3115225 its very hard to tell your banker that hes wrong
3115226 ever wonder what washington has done with your tax dollars this olympics is your chance to find out for the last 8 years the bush administration has been paying china billions of dollars in interest on the trillions it borrowed for tax breaks pork and special privileges you never got that money helped create thousands of businesses and millions of jobs in china so as you enjoy the games keep an eye on your tax dollars at work the way our economys going its tough to pay your bills but take heart you already paid chinas
3115227 youre looking forward now to a much different life for yourself
3115228 there are some one way conversations going on cause ive said i cant talk but i certainly can listen
3115229 the thing thats important for someone with my experience to talk about is the state of politics in washington
3115230 its created what i call a extremely dysfunctional hyperpartisan senate were getting little to nothing done
3115231 could romney be planning to establish residency in california with an eye on the governors seat gov schwarzenegger is forced out by term limits in 2010 stay tuned
3115232 governor romney has been looking at property on the west coast because he has family in california and because his wife ann spends a good deal of time there riding horses
3115233 the number of deviant offenders a community can afford to recognize is likely to remain stable over time
3115234 malta is not an obvious place for a love affair to flourish not unlike staten island it tends to be a conservative place
3115235 word about the affair spread and republican officials soon became concerned fearing it would be exposed sources said
3115236 a pattern of conduct was exhibited among many individuals to remain willfully ignorant
3115237 i lost confidence in her and im not going to kid you
3115238 i was also concerned with this other relationship thing it didnt look like it should
3115239 at least 70 frivolous duplicative and repetitive actions in this court
3115240 by the time the order was issued that number had reached 82
3115241 the government can operate on its own self produced money
3115242 all superdelegates should save their endorsements for candidates with a real shot
3115243 when it comes to national security any big dog should think twice before agreeing to a long journey with mitt romney
3115244 a small varmint gun totin civil rights marching nra endorsed fantasy candidate
3115245 its one thing to campaign for my dad someone whose principles i line up with almost entirely
3115246 in this time of war i simply cannot let my campaign be a part of aiding a surrender to terror
3115247 we cannot allow the next president of the united states to retreat in the face of evil extremism
3115248 as a lifelong hunter i didnt want to miss the start of varmint season
3115249 its tenacious coverage of the twists and turns in the scandal involving the states senator larry craig
3115250 this was news to most idaho voters who have viewed the whole affair with shock outrage embarrassment and dismay but craig didnt stop there
3115251 i know ill love it because clean air clean water and many many many mountains
3115252 my heart my mind my body my soul my thoughts are in this to win
3115253 if i save one babys life it will be worth it
3115254 voters are casting a vote for a person and not a political proposition
3115255 the people that vote for me are more intelligent than to have something defined in legislation like this
3115256 the pirates are not in a rebuilding mode were in a building mode
3115257 trolling for sex in a mens room doesnt logically require that you support gay marriage
3115258 over the course of my public life i have insisted i believe correctly that people regardless of their position or power take responsibility for their conduct i can and will ask no less of myself
3115259 its one thing to campaign for my dad someone whose principles i line up with almost entirely
3115260 youve got this built in campaign team with your sons
3115261 to discuss the former massachusetts governor becoming the face of conservatism
3115262 was it for this that all that blood was shed
3115263 if someone had suggested a year ago and a half ago that we would be welcoming mitt romney as a potential leader of the conservative movement no one would have believed it
3115264 but over the last year and a half he has convinced us he is one of us and walks with us
3115265 you could tell everybody at the table sitting with romney was asking himself is he the one
3115266 i sampled all of the alaskan classics moose salmon and whale oh so good
3115267 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
3115268 thats second nature to me whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
3115269 is different than anything ive ever done that kind of has a pop quality to it
3115270 when i was a kid growing up in the southwest i worked for a rodeo company
3115271 so we wanted to do the comedy to tip our hats to the old burt reynolds movies and we wanted our characters to be strong and have the toast be a thread that runs through the movie
3115272 i was really concerned about hollywood meets ted nugent with their extreme difference in philosophies
3115273 teds a good friend of mine and teds not a hater yeah hes got a strong agenda and he carries a gun but hes never pulled it on anyone he can be dangerous if you try to tread on him but he doesnt bring the hate to the table hes so fun he kept everybody in stitches
3115274 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
3115275 al gore heard me say that and said were going to get some people on opposite ends of confrontation like rosie and donald trump and put em on the tv
3115276 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3115277 you realize that you know what 50 million spins as a writer compares to lennon the bee gees and billy joel
3115278 ive got a 35 greatest hits album in the store right now
3115279 you can imagine how much it meant to people who needed that song whether people hated it or loved it it left its mark
3115280 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3115281 most people who talk about courtesy of the red white and blue never even heard the song
3115282 if you read it word for word you know what it means lets go out and get the people responsible for 9 11 they attacked new york they attacked the pentagon they came and killed a bunch of innocent americans
3115283 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war
3115284 my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3115285 his presidency will be better judged 40 years from now
3115286 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say
3115287 if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
3115288 i think obama stands the best chance for the democratic party since clinton mccain is a good solid choice a smarter version of what we have we probably need a change and the economy needs a change and come election day ill have my mind made up
3115289 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3115290 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3115291 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3115292 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3115293 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3115294 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3115295 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3115296 but i dont really have a good argument that the government should be the one to prevent abortion because of my religious beliefs
3115297 yes the other issues do matter but as a christian my belief system supports the idea that human life is sacred it doesnt matter if that human life is accidental or the result of rape as tragic as those situations are human life is sacred
3115298 for many democratic activists and operatives the phrase white christian still conjures up images of finger wagging priests and scopes era fundamentalists
3115299 even if he makes a marginal improvement with that huge group of voters that could ultimately be very important in certain swing states like my state of virginia where evangelicals comprise a large portion of the voters
3115300 many will either sit on their hands on election day or even if they vote for mccain they wont be out there mobilizing the base and doing the hard work that these folks have done in the past for the republican party
3115301 there are some data that young evangelicals are focusing on a variety of issues not just the social issues but i dont see a voting shift taking place just because younger folks care about the environment doesnt mean thats going to trump their concerns about the life issues
3115302 thats the minimal step he has to take to reduce the animosity against him on abortion
3115303 and if he doesnt do even that hes basically kissing goodbye the chances of making deep inroads in the white evangelical vote
3115304 he has got to come out forcibly and talk about reducing abortions in america he has to forcibly come out and talk about education and abstinence programs
3115305 we evangelicals have to face the fact that when we speak on this issue we in the church do not have enough authority to convince people of that position and have to resort to the coercion of the law
3115306 we have lost our moral authority in this society we havent been able to impact our own community to the extent that we should
3115307 explain to me how you can live with your conscience and sleep at night
3115308 why emulate the failures of american education as opposed to the successes of european education
3115309 they could be if canadian policy makers like you did their jobs correctly
3115310 this high quality reproduction is manufacture to almost the exact same specification as the original

3115326 they did an act namely disrupting the running of the power station by causing the water inlet cooling system to be shut down
3115327 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
3115328 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
3115329 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
3115330 theres no more important voter in this media market than the hispanic swing vote
3115331 i think people like me feel proud of being in a thinking process rather than just going with one party
3115332 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
3115333 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3115334 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3115335 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3115336 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3115337 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3115338 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3115339 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3115340 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3115341 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3115342 i had a guy shoot a gun next to me thats how bad it was
3115343 i thought i would see this only on tv never in real life
3115344 its too early to say what happened exactly were talking about the death of a man its a major investigation
3115345 we only know what we see in the news in the newspapers thats all
3115346 were there to listen to understand what happened sunday night and to avoid these kinds of situations
3115347 williamson expressed his support for the mission and concern over the fact deployment is so slow
3115348 the people are being pushed towards a revolution the indian government is not serious about resolving the kashmir issue
3115349 we do not have a single ampoule remaining in the central store on the wards they are some but the situation is dangerous
3115350 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3115351 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3115352 you dont have to attack the united states to put us on our back you just cut 30 percent of the oil
3115353 global warming is on page two for me page one is foreign oil
3115354 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
3115355 dont allow the fruits of the victory achieved through the sacrifices of the mujahedeen fighting in afghanistan iraq and the tribal belt of pakistan to be hijacked by the politicians who sat passively while the girls and boys of the red mosque perished and burned
3115356 these are the same politicians who follow the tenets of an alien western democratic system and judiciary and exploit islam to fulfill their own greedy aims
3115357 the maoists still have the rebel army confined in camps and weapons in containers and the peace process is yet to be taken to a logical conclusion
3115358 maoists cant run the government if they are put in a wheelchair with their hands and feet tied together
3115359 the car is so low it suffocates the radiator suffocates the exhaust
3115360 it doesnt allow the car to breathe thats why i drive trucks everyone knows that it floods down here personally i find a different way around it and avoid it
3115361 the only thing more dangerous than being americas enemy is being americas ally
3115362 criticism may not be agreeable but it is necessary it fulfils the same function as pain in the human body it calls attention to an unhealthy state of things
3115363 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
3115364 but this section of georgia wanted to be part of russia for over 10 years theyve had votes etc on the issue
3115365 russia has been the only force for stability in the caucasus for the past two hundred years
3115366 2 the iraqis whom we armed and trained to fight the iranians whom we armed with chemical weapons
3115367 the united states supported iraq during the iran iraq war as a counterbalance to post revolutionary iran the support took the form of technological aid intelligence the sale of dual use and military equipment and direct involvement in warfare against iran
3115368 the american ambassador declared to her iraqi interlocutor that washington
3115369 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
3115370 why were our soldiers in kosovo and iraq if we dont get any help from the west now
3115371 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3115372 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3115373 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3115374 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3115375 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3115376 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3115377 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3115378 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3115379 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3115380 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3115381 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3115382 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3115383 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3115384 the opening will mark the halfway mark of an ambitious project under the australia indonesia partnership to build or expand 2 000 high schools across 20 provinces by the end of 2009
3115385 australia is funding this program to help indonesia fulfil its vision that all young indonesians will have nine years of basic education
3115386 our construction alone will create some 330 000 new places in junior high schools including in some of indonesias poorest and remote areas
3115387 in all challenges indonesia can count on australia to work with it as a friend and partner
3115388 achievement is largely the product of steadily raising ones levels of aspiration and expectation

3115444 there was advice that we received from the security consultants that it might be better not to start the competition from the 11th and move to the 12th
3115445 it is a strong possibility that we will reduce the champions trophy to two venues but the event will be played in pakistan
3115446 i am quite impressed with the level of security in place it is another matter to satisfy and improve the confidence of key players
3115447 i could not have asked any more from the boys
3115448 if we play like we played this week we can beat australia the key is to turn up like we did this week in every game

3115458 rapidly rising health care costs are not simply a federal budget problem
3115459 growth in health related spending is the primary driver of the fiscal challenges facing state and local governments as well unsustainable growth in health care spending also threatens to erode the ability of employers to provide coverage to their workers and undercuts their ability to compete in a global marketplace

3115477 we have had our financial issues but that doesnt make it any easier its not a palatable decision
3115478 that cost us 2 5 million and we are one of the only unions in the country that owns its own ground so most dont have to worry about those sorts of costs
3115479 for the last two years weve finished in the first 10 so i dont think anyone could reasonably say our playing performance has been inhibited
3115480 in terms of registrations we are about number eight in the country population base i think we are in the first 10 if not higher
3115481 so far we have not been provided any additional money from the nzru other than what we are entitled to save for a small advance payment

3115484 barack told me it was hard to find the time and i said youd better
3115485 everyone knows there is bad blood between the obamas and the clintons
3115486 obama could use the clintons help even if he is reluctant to admit it
3115487 and exude the labored air of middle east peace talks

3115490 i dont think the market is as focused on aggression now its now far more about being conservative and building the business going into a bio tech company was quite a risk its not a market to do that
3115491 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
3115492 letter to a new president commonsense lessons for our next leader
3115493 son of privilege and dynasty who had defined himself as the president of only that fraction of the country which shared his world view
3115494 sen byrd doesnt believe sen mccain is going to be the next president
3115495 but if sen mccain is interested in receiving a copy of the book wed be happy to get him a copy
3115496 a big lie is still a lie tell the truth
3115497 let the press do its job even when that might sting
3115498 i would submit that a president who is unable to learn from his or her own mistakes and then to articulate for a curious public what he or she has learned is not prepared for that office
3115499 banished himself to the ignominious position of worst united states president ever
3115500 built much of its program around a basic commitment to lying

3115509 its not what you say its how you say it
3115510 this is a tragic loss of two young lives and our thoughts are with their families as they try to come to terms with what has happened
3115511 it is understandable after whats happened that theres a great deal of concern in the community and were addressing that with local officers carrying out extra patrols in the area and will be speaking to residents individually to reassure them all is being done to find the offenders
3115512 given the complexity of the issues it may be several months before those aspects are finalised
3115513 this is a tragic loss of two young lives and our thoughts are with their families as they try to come to terms with what has happened

3115520 all i know is that in the past when anythings been taken away from erasmus hes always come back with a vengeance
3115521 and thats the plan he needs to come back with a vengeance wanting to establish himself as a good football player in this league
3115522 its always been a first round draft pick and trying to overcome injuries
3115523 its been pretty hard but i enjoy the patience the redskins have had and i feel like im ready to go out there and actually show what first round is
3115524 weve seen in the training room and the weight room that desire to get back healthy
3115525 he has definitely overachieved there were very hopeful thats going to carry over
3115526 it adds another very good football player into the mix
3115527 i dont want to judge erasmus too quickly weve got some other guys who have been pushing for some playing time as well so its nice to have that problem
3115528 astellas will be in contact with the fda within the next few days to discuss next steps and we expect that several months may be required to assemble a complete and appropriate response
3115529 while this action letter could result in the need for an additional clinical study cardiome is optimistic that the questions raised can be satisfactorily addressed from currently available data
3115530 astellas and cardiome strongly believe in the therapeutic value of kynapid based on clinical trial data and are confident it will be an important therapy in the treatment of atrial fibrillation
3115531 detailed expressions of interest from global and regional pharmaceutical companies
3115532 there was no way we can spend our limit so we were asked by the party if we can help contribute
3115533 its a whole process that the city has to go through to determine if theyre fit to be released to the public or if they should be humanely euthanized
3115534 daniel is no 1 in the world and theres not too many players of his caliber to begin with
3115535 hes practically a living legend playing with him is a tough spot to put anyone any partner is going to have trouble matching up
3115536 if niemeyer wins its because of daniel if they lose its because of who he played with its a difficult situation for any player to be in

3115549 one time 10 million euro trade when japan produced negative results after spending 300 billion over the course of 7 months
3115550 its very different from situations like cardiac disease or diabetes where patients can wear devices that measure heart rate or blood pressure 24 hours a day for a week or more to get a better idea of whats going on we dont have that for glaucoma and thats one of the biggest clinical frustrations we have
3115551 this material has been widely used in biology because its easy to work with and can bend and flex like skin
3115552 but the problem is its not conductive and if you want to make it sensing it has to be conductive
3115553 this device is really a breakthrough in real time iop monitoring
3115554 we dont have a means right now to measure pressure in real time outside of the clinic because of that we are missing the fluctuations in iop that could be pertinent to the pathogenesis of glaucoma
3115555 when i caught it it scared me it was very aggressive it snapped his jaw and snorted at me when i tried to get it it cut the hook in half leaving part of it in its mouth

3115557 probably it got too big and somebody just dumped in the lake
3115558 you would not believe what has come out of that lake
3115559 this does not surprise me at all not at all
3115560 you never know what you are going to catch and thats a fact
3115561 focusing on one possible distraction could very well create a false sense of security
3115562 it would be most effective to look at all the possible problems that can arise in situations that drivers could be confronted with and deal with them comprehensively
3115563 that i think is what pushed us over to decide that its not a question of hands free or hand held
3115564 its just a question of talking on a cell phone
3115565 to take into account the studies that conclude that it is a distraction and to ignore those that would conclude the contrary doesnt do the whole debate justice
3115566 to look at one potential behavior and highlight it and ignore dozens of others that are extremely common is not dealing with this situation as effectively as it could be
3115567 im not sure that any law can be too strict when youre talking about protecting the children in these school zones
3115568 it just doesnt seem to be overly burdensome to say please hold on put down the phone
3115569 weve had a lot of near misses reported to us
3115570 so we started doing a little bit of on site research on our school just looking at it sure enough it was a true issue a true problem
3115571 i did 21 death penalty cases either as the lead or on a team
3115572 upon reflection leon dorsey is probably no 1 as the meanest criminal i prosecuted
3115573 thats over and done with i could have came in here and been oh im sorry im so bad but i dont feel like that thats not being honest with myself
3115574 we had to convince the jury hed be a continuing danger and he more than satisfied that in prison
3115575 ive done cut folks ive done stabbed folks ive killed folks

3115577 the appellate court did not decide anything on the merits

3115586 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3115587 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3115588 we are trying to be more efficient which means not do consultations that result in a difference for the species
3115589 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3115590 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3115591 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door

3115814 what is taking place now is not unexpected the russian federation as you recall on many occasions drew attention to the dangerous situation which was evolving around south ossetia the russian federation on many occasions drew attention to the fact that georgia was increasing at an increasing rate its offensive weapons georgia is the world record holder in the increase of its military budget which over recent years has grown by thirty times and now we understand what the purpose of all this was
3115815 definitely there has to be a very clear timeline timeline ok

3115818 yeah i actually i was dragged out by the police so you can see like ive been bleeding from like being dragged on the floor and then this is from the security guards this is from the security guards inside when they had this like cardboard that was like slicing my arm open in the beginning we hoped to actually go in and we hoped to hold up a tibetan flag and also this other banner you know in protest of the communist partys one party rule in china
3115819 we ask the united nations and the international society to push north korea pakistan and israel to denuclearize and hold strict measures against irans suspected nuclear weapons
3115820 sometimes i start with some specific objects that lead to a series of paintings that focus on ideas or symbols represented by objects such as eggs gold forms skulls or other objects and other times i pursue an idea that interested me in the past
3115821 in either case i go through a long and difficult process of putting shapes and colors together adding more things taking objects away reformatting the composition looking at the arrangement from different vantage points making graphite studies and starting the process over again before im ready to paint
3115822 every painting is the result of a completely different set of motivations and perceptions yet there are commonalities that reflect my personality
3115823 for example the still lifes are almost always complex arrangements containing a major or primary still life and one or more secondary still lifes within the same painting that is some things are arranged on top of a table while others appear on the floor or a lower shelf and my vantage point is frequently from above the setup if you compare one of my paintings to a still life by giorgio morandi or francisco zurbaran for example you will quickly see how differently i approach still life i love what other artists have done with simple straight on views of fruit and vessels but my interest in still life painting is very different
3115824 it seldom has to do with the function of the vase utensil or bowl
3115825 its more apt to be about the relationship of the colors and textures of the objects as well as of their scale and shape
3115826 once im satisfied with a plan for a painting i use grid lines to redraw the outlines of the forms from the full scale drawing to a piece of toned paper and i begin working very directly with pastels
3115827 i immediately indicate the local color rather than underpaint complements or block in a grisaille of values
3115828 i need to see some evidence of the entire picture on the paper before i concentrate on any one element i dont use hard pastels to make those initial indications because i prefer to only work with soft pastels being mindful of the color key that is the intensity and relative value of the colors
3115829 no matter how i tried i wasnt able to relate to what i saw as chaotic and without visual appeal
3115830 i immediately started moving things around looking at them from the left and the right raising and lowering my vantage point and turning the vessels in one direction or another the finished paintings look considerably different from my more intentionally constructed still lifes but they still represent my process and point of view i should have known from the beginning that it was hopeless to think i could respond in any other way
3115831 ive done self portraits throughout my career for many of the same reasons artists have been creating them for centuries
3115832 im always available i dont expect to be paid and the artist doesnt have to flatter me in the way she paints my image its also interesting to look back on the paintings and remember what was going on in my life and my art and to immediately recall the feelings that motivated the pose lighting and dress
3115833 i was struck by and very interested in the beauty and grace of the human form as depicted in a painting of adam and eve by albrecht d rer 1471 1528
3115834 i thought about paying homage to the artist and revisiting the theme by adapting the figures in a diptych of adam and eve contemporizing the story of mankinds original sin by suggesting the prevalence of greed in the culture today the gold fabric golden apple and brass vessels represent the material possessions that continue to tempt people while the skulls remind us of the transience of life the branch of leaves that extends from one painting to the other suggests the tree of knowledge of good and evil and the corked bottles of wine lilies cattails and serpents are some of the traditional iconography associated with biblical stories
3115835 the old master pastelist that immediately comes to mind is edgar degas
3115836 his mark making conveys a sense of motion and intentionality but what fascinates me most about his work are his dynamic compositions and unusual viewing angles one of my favorites is six friends at dieppe the painting is essentially a group portrait but the dynamics of the composition create a tension and intrigue that makes the viewer wonder what is truly going on the poses arent static and the visible strokes of pastel almost set the painting into motion
3115837 i think that mary cassatt is a great artist to study for her magnificent use of pastel strokes
3115838 it is especially interesting to see how she could weave bold linear pastel strokes throughout her figures and portraits and still create solid convincing and sensitive forms
3115839 he used pastel with a freshness and vitality rivaling that of any european master
3115840 some of his pastels were very large up to six feet high and done on canvas like degas he often wet his pastel and worked over his pieces with brushes
3115841 he was one of the first to really draw with the medium and use broken strokes of color rather than blending the colors extensively the way many early pastelists did
3115842 i was pleasantly surprised to learn that it was not much different than painting a 16
3115843 if i paint them in jeans and t shirts the portrait becomes dated
3115844 if i can introduce a costume from the past it becomes timeless
3115845 i want people to say thats a great piece of art rather than thats a great portrait
3115846 i can look at 10 different options quickly combine images move them around and tweak them until the composition is right as a result my compositions are better
3115847 i like to paint as loosely as i can and still have it read
3115848 painting from life is the best teacher and its hard to beat the lessons learned by painting a small simple still life
3115849 thats what excites me maybe thats why i dont glaze lots of layers because i dont have the patience
3115850 my preference is to have a painting go predominantly in one color direction
3115851 i believe that artists are made not born granted it comes easier to some people than others but if you practice you will improve all the elements of good painting are possible to learn but i hate to give hard and fast rules because some artist will come along break them and do it marvelously
3115852 its a privilege to pursue something i have a passion for as a career
3115853 it doesnt feel like work although there is lots of hard work involved
3115854 i thought what am i going to do with this girl so i combined her with a picture from italy a cathedral in tuscany
3115855 gardner has a very crisp way of handling paint an artist could have focused on the city in the background but the boat was so present in the foreground we all handled this scene quite differently
3115856 this project was good for our friendship it gave me a little better look at these two
3115857 you have a tendency to think you know someone because of your experience and history with them but theres always more this project made gardner and buechner a little more clear to me
3115858 there was definitely the sense of oh ill never be able to turn
3115859 how did they come up with their ideas from this photograph they have such great imaginations so i just laid in what i saw and while i was looking at my canvas i noticed a reproduction of sargents piece of paul helleu painting by a pond that i had hanging beyond my easel and i decided on a lark to try to learn a little by copying a sargent see the pond painting below so i incorporated his painter into the pond scene from the photograph i looked at it like a learning tool as an exercise
3115860 the difference from theirs to mine is subtle i spattered it with snow flurries that had to be treated carefully
3115861 i wanted to have a little bit of action in it
3115862 some were far enough afield from my predilections that i had to work on them more and sometimes the photos were hard because they were just so beautiful
3115863 i had to find a way to deny their picturesque quality its interesting to have a photo so beautiful that it actually could make a less interesting painting
3115864 it stimulated us and we may have done some work that was better than we would have done otherwise
3115865 ik hoop mijn nieuwe landgenoten met een goede prestatie wat vreugde te kunnen bezorgen

3115868 maar dat maakte me niets wijzer de russen geven de georgi rs de schuld en die wijzen de russen dan weer met de vinger ik geraak er niet wijs uit

3115873 in literature im interested in those moments between events the descriptions of settings and the way characters look at each other i love those moments in film as well some of my paintings merely depict a particular moment in a familys day when everyone is doing something different in very close proximity to one another in other pictures i have used well known narratives or characters to guide the choices in my compositions i recently became interested in painting different kinds of mother characters for example i worked with the character of anna karenina a glamorous but alienated mother right now im working on drawings about house hunters maybe all the news about the real estate market has inspired this idea
3115874 i used to love mallarm s quote that said you should suggest and not name because thats where the poetry lies
3115875 im trying to get mystery and specificity at the same time
3115876 i can always go and check something if i need to
3115877 but painting from memory somehow allows for a more resolved image
3115878 i started working in a new and kind of crazy way a few years ago
3115879 i work from the specific to the general on a large canvas i might start by painting something very small a vase of flowers for example next i will add something to it the arm of a figure behind it perhaps i keep adding to the first parts bit by bit so that the painting grows organically from that first seed some of the parts are painted from life and some from memory or photos
3115880 but for me it helps me to knit together every part of the picture and i like the fact that i have no idea what the final composition will look like when i start
3115881 i used to use a very good paint which i then mixed with marble dust and wax in order to make a dry matte and almost cementlike paint recently i have discovered maroger medium available at
3115882 but then i had a mural project at the brandeis university womens studies research center in waltham massachusetts and i ordered theatrical casein ive been using that for some of the small pieces
3115883 its something that i would never do in a big painting
3115884 i just dont think it would work on a much larger scale
3115885 although art was my consuming interest i wanted to go to a liberal arts university where i could study literature and art history and science
3115886 i come from a family of scientists and i loved constables idea that landscape painting could be considered a branch of the natural sciences
3115887 although he gave a lot of particular information and for me it was remedial training since i did not go to art school he never taught us to paint in a particular way he simply encouraged the making of pictures as a form of expression
3115888 while also conveying human figures that are more psychologically and visually believable
3115889 i advise them to pursue their passions even if it means worrying their parents and giving up a more lucrative and stable career option
3115890 i assure them they will have a wonderful life if they love their work a life spent in the studio is full of wonder and revelation
3115891 we look forward to continuing our relationship with the university at albany and the city of albany
3115892 u albany is our summer home and thats not just because of the great resources and facilities we are provided but it is mostly because the administration and staff have made us feel welcome and have always gone out of their way to accommodate our needs
3115893 the giants have been part of the university at albany family since 1996
3115894 were pleased that they will be back for the 2009 summer training camp

3115899 we havent announced anything for this type of cheap mini notebook and were still taking this wait and see attitude
3115900 if you cant grow the market with this form factor then what youre providing is a lower experience for less money which isnt good for the consumer and isnt good for the hardware maker and really isnt good for the channel as well
3115901 empirical findings are more consistent with the position that undocumented workers hold jobs that other groups find unattractive than with the widely held public perception that illegals compete with natives for jobs and wages
3115902 total number of native born low wage workers fell by about 1 8 million while the number of immigrants rose by 620 000
3115903 as more and more native born adults are earning high school diplomas and college degrees there is an increasing demand for lower skilled immigrants
3115904 there seems to be little doubt that any negative effects of immigration on earnings are modest in magnitude and mostly short term in nature
3115905 would provide all the goods and services for which individuals are prepared to pay a price that covers their production cost
3115906 public goods exhibit three technical characteristics non rivalness in consumption non excludability and non rejectability which together imply that the market is likely to product inefficiently
3115907 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
3115908 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
3115909 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
3115910 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
3115911 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
3115912 cafe carciofo in cobble hill was dohd on july 29th and over the weekend they were
3115913 thank goodness the democrats have nominated a man as honest as obama
3115914 all rights are claims to an affirmative governmental response all rights amount to entitlements defined and safeguarded by the law
3115915 staring hard at costs shatters the libertarian fiction that individuals who excercise their rights in the classical eighteenth century sense are just going about their business immaculately independent of the government and the taxpaying community
3115916 the simple insight that rights have costs points the way towards an appreciation of the inevitability of government and of the various good things that government does many of which are so taken for granted that to the casual observer they do not appear to involve government at all

3115935 no in fact the world produces enough to make us all plump true today an estimated 100 million additional people are or will soon be facing hunger as food prices exceed their budgets but the deeper lack theyre experiencing is not food itself it is power
3115936 prices for fertilizer and pesticides have gone up even more than food prices
3115937 there are other things that have been suggested by treasury secretary over the weekend and we want to get those right and include that in the legislation
3115938 we need to try and get this right from a legislative perspective and not just accept anything that comes
3115939 it would be irresponsible for congress to provide the proposed new authority without doing due diligence on the mechanics of the treasury proposal and its potential implications for taxpayers
3115940 should be linked to a commitment to meaningful reform of the gses and should not be coupled with a multi billion dollar taxpayer funded bailout bill that includes no reform or a multi billion dollar permanent new government spending program

3115957 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3115958 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3115959 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3115960 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3115961 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3115962 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3115963 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3115964 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3115965 the future is here its just not evenly distributed yet

3115968 this crisis is a watershed moment that demands an exceptionally high quality of diplomacy and it is not clear whether this tired and distracted us administration is able to provide that
3115969 i never got invited you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am
3115970 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
3115971 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me
3115972 i won seven events if they had the 50m freestyle back then which they do now i probably would have won that too
3115973 but as soon as the swimming was over and michael phelps didnt break my record every time i went to beach volley they put my face on the volleyballs
3115974 hes almost identical to me hes a world record holder in all these events so he is dominating the events just like i did

3115988 sailing performance was undoubtedly slowed by the 19 inch diameter propellers on our test boat designed to turn freely when sailing the props are big so they can regenerate electricity starting at about 4 5 knots it took us 10 knots of wind to reach that speed even with the reacher set but once it overcame that threshold the boat became more responsive reaching at 7 knots when the wind spiked to 12
3115989 noaa great lakes vessels all the ships on the lakes are moving to biodiesel and now smell like fries and fried pies scout hybrid 145 although still packing a fuel hogging 20hp yamaha the boat flanks that with lenco dual 36 volt drives no mention on the speak the dual lencos can generate
3115990 the 18 foot st tropez model from austrian manufacturer frauscher runs a cool 150 000 and can only manage 5 knots under electric power but that increases to 38 when you switch over to the diesel engine

3115993 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe

3116001 her power and very deft skills make her ideal in the position and she has developed into being one of the better finishers in world hockey
3116002 as our coach says thats what you get paid to do but it really was the cherry on top of the whole cake
3116003 my teammates joke we know you had to tough it out the last few years
3116004 away from the playing field she is extremely competitive in everything she does while maintaining a gentle persona that endears her to her teammates
3116005 it is funny to see one of the most powerful athletes in our team board a plane with her san diego chargers supporter teddy bear under her arm
3116006 is not the product of some awesome and irresistible force like globalization but rather of decades of hard right wing work of careful bureaucratic sabotage and an occasional shot of lobbyist money
3116007 and yet we spend most of our time blowing flatus about theme or symbol or political context or structural messing about why because it distracts us from our own narrative

3116017 it was shall we say somewhat of a godsend when we were picked to be the first major wind farm in nebraska

3116019 in fact the state ranks 6th in america for wind development potential

3116042 russia will have to think real hard before delivering this system to iran which is possibly on the brink of conflict with either israel or the us since if the system is delivered an ew electronic warfare system will likely be developed to neutralize it and if that happens it would be catastrophic not only for iran but also for russia
3116043 no country will want to buy the system if it is proven to be ineffective
3116044 for these reasons russia may not deliver it in the end to iran

3116049 studies show that the great lakes hold a great potential for wind power development
3116050 its a matter of time before a project like this moves forward
3116051 were certainly interested in seeing if there are ways of making that happen and making it happen in a way thats not disruptive to other users ourselves and the natural ecology of the lakes
3116052 i dont think that many people think windmills are ugly maybe one in 10

3116065 the foundation of good personal appearance is cleanliness personal grooming and cleanliness should always be seen in the context of our present economic and cultural situations this means that simple grooming is needed as much as possible but not at the cost of cleanliness and neatness and a liability an asset if it is properly controlled and if it contributes to neatness a liability if it becomes unruly or shabby a well groomed person is always attractive to behold as a general guideline one should get a haircut whenever ones hair no longer looks good not when it is intolerably bushy but whenever it loses its neat appearance the style of haircut also influences ones appearance regular haircut for a seminarian should be such that his hair is not so big and bishy as to cover the ears at the sides or the collar of the shirt at the back in any case ones style of haircut should be suited to the persons head

3116150 coupling a peripheral canal the least expensive option with investment in the delta ecosystem can promote both environmental sustainability and a reliable water supply
3116151 the belief has been that were defending the environment by maintaining the freshwater system but that is actually incompatible with giving the deltas native species and ecosystem a fighting chance to survive and prosper
3116152 neither the ppic report authors nor officials with the state have done a full scale economic analysis of how a change in water quality with the operation of a peripheral canal would impact farming recreation or fisheries
3116153 it is estimated that delta farming alone contributes 2 billion per year to our local economy and recreation like boating and fishing another 750 million if the delta is made into a salty inland sea the economic impacts will be devastating to those living in the surrounding five counties of the delta
3116154 finding the balance a vision for water supply and environmental reliability in california
3116155 a vicious cycle of water shortages and environmental near disasters and instead create a stable and reliable water supply
3116156 our water supplies will remain vulnerable as long as we allow the environment to remain at the brink of disaster
3116157 for decades water users have sought to pump additional water out of our central valley streams then species have declined and ultimately the courts are forced to step in to prevent an environmental catastrophe
3116158 we have a great opportunity right now to create a reliable water supply for future generations of californians and for salmon as well
3116159 we believe that california has enough water for its people farms and fish
3116160 if we manage our water better we can protect our states economy and our environment we can have a thriving fishing industry in the future and we can make sure our farms are able to produce the food and jobs that we need
3116161 could soon disappear permanently from the states rivers restaurant menus and supermarkets if massive water diversions from the san francisco bay delta continue unabated
3116162 fish out of water how water management in the bay delta threatens the future of californias salmon fishery
3116163 the future of californias salmon fishery is completely dependent on how we manage water in the bay delta ecosystem
3116164 california agencies must implement existing requirements to restore salmon reform management of the water projects and reduce water diversions
3116165 the collapse of the salmon fishery is among the nations worst man made fishery disasters ever
3116166 it is on par with the exxon valdez spill or the closure of the new england cod fishery but we believe that we can bring back our fishery if we do the right things in managing our waters in the rivers and in the delta we can save our salmon and save our birthright
3116167 commercial salmon fishermen are paying a heavy price for the poaching of water from the bay delta the policy of this state is to double salmon populations not decimate them
3116168 we need to reduce delta diversions if we expect to bring back the salmon the bottom line is fish need water
3116169 now the state is considering a peripheral canal which the ppic report states could have major negative effects on salmon
3116170 this is ridiculous we are only now starting to right the wrongs of the bush administrations illegal water plans the debate about the peripheral canal is adding insult to injury to californias fishing communities
3116171 those of us who represent the delta region and its watershed know that the peripheral canal is not likely to solve our challenges from the disappearance of our states iconic salmon fishery to the repair and management of the fragile levees that support our communities
3116172 its past time for us to develop a sustainable water policy for all californians any water plan that focuses on exports and excludes the protection of the bay delta is a non starter as it has been for the last thirty years

3116175 ive never seen anything like this in my career for software
3116176 the participants demonstrated a perception that not having to attach receipts to the return creates a temptation for electronic filers to overstate their claims for deductions and credits
3116177 there is no need to supply receipts so sometimes people may think they can get away with it without getting caught
3116178 the underestimating part could be more forgetting or not adding things up properly or maybe theyre not sure they have all their information
3116179 they believed they would not be caught as long as the overstatements were relatively small
3116180 i would recommend people who think they can get away with this to not try it

3116203 we were all outside when the game started and the only way we could find out what was going on was text messages from home
3116204 i couldnt believe it it was the first time casey was playing in an olympics and we were stuck outside it was a nightmare
3116205 people were saying we should ask for our money back but nothing will compensate us for what we missed out on
3116206 the only good thing about the night was that they won
3116207 it was a shambles and we wouldnt have seen any of the game if it wasnt for this kiwi guy who knew the lingo
3116208 no one spoke english at the venue and we couldnt understand any of the announcements because they were all in chinese
3116209 we werent the only ones caught out there were people from around the world trying to get into the area
3116210 casey just deflected the ball in the circle and an unlucky korea girl put it in her own net

3116229 from what i understand his relationship with australand is not the reason for the delay
3116230 previously there were people who believed the megafauna were wiped out by humans alone those who believed it was climate change alone and the majority believed it was a combination of the two
3116231 these animals disappeared very very quickly and while climate could have led to their waterholes drying up forcing them into closer contact with people the vegetation and climate in tasmania have in fact remained stable
3116232 we believe it was an imperceptible overkill of the adolescents of these incredibly slow producing animals that finally knocked them on the head
3116233 wherever prehistoric people arrived in new zealand australia north america they made a mess of things just like the later colonisers did
3116234 it was the same in the case of the tasmanian tiger by the time they realised they needed to save the species the last one was dying in hobart zoo
3116235 it is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today

3116244 i intend that by next week this document will be placed as a memo adopted by the minister of energy for consideration and passage by federal executive council and that will form the first critical step for the implementation of the recommendation of the report
3116245 indeed all of us know that other national oil companies that have come into being after our national oil company are now by far ahead of us because they have restructured and operating in a manner that this report proposes to organise our petroleum sector and have a truly national oil company that will be commercially and profit oriented and that will compete with other national oil companies elsewhere in the world
3116246 we have prepared in the process a draft bill to go with the recommendation and this draft bill provides in some sense for the realignment of some of the existing laws in some case creating of new laws to make it more up to date and more importantly to put the oil industry on a much more key so that it can run better
3116247 the law itself is intended to make it clear the different roles of the different organs of government for some of the confusion we had in the past is the overlapping responsibility and authority to be clarified so that so that new structures that are going to be in place will have a clear cut mandate of what is required of them and so that there will be no confusion in those structures so that the whole industry will work efficiently than in the past
3116248 all ugandan companies since listing have had their market capitalisation growing tremendously although some hard a bit of difficulties and took them some times to see increase in their market capitalisation

3116250 from the banking industry point of view within the next three to five years theres a big storm coming banks from west africa are already coming with very big cheque books and they have huge appetites
3116251 if we are not careful the local banks are going to find it difficult to compete with them in the next four or five years
3116252 to be successful know your market and now how to service it well
3116253 the days of being an all round player are rapidly falling away and it is in all industries
3116254 it is the niche players that will survive along the big players
3116255 the opening of ecobank burundi reaffirms our commitment to bring superior banking services and products to all customers spread across east africa in particular and the african continent in general
3116256 they should be able to offer similar products that new banks are coming with to survive
3116257 as customers of these banks we expect improvement in the way banks treat us the customer service approach will be improved and as competition tightens banking services will become cheaper and better
3116258 we expect banks to go to the rural areas and inculcate a savings culture among the rural dwellers
3116259 we believe competition is healthy for the industry dfcu is a strong brand in this market and we are a growing institution
3116260 we will do what we have to do and we shall do it right
3116261 mwanza first because there is a lot of business travel there the traffic is very heavy and because people are flying quite frequently and for them to do so they also need to save
3116262 for now we know it will be nairobi mwanza but if there is market and demand for entebbe mwanza we will defiantly consider it
3116263 then we will open up kigali and then head to west africa ghana will be the hub for west african region in southern africa we shall use angola as our hub so it will become a pan african low cost airline
3116264 we want to go to these markets because there is no pan african airline and a low cost one yet people want to have an alternative airline that is not going to chip into their budget but offer them the services they require so we taking the bold step and going to do that

3116283 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

3116371 act of provocation us nato military and intelligence planners invariably examine various scenarios of a proposed military operation i e in this case a limited georgian attack largely directed against civilian targets with a view to inflicting civilian casualties the examination of scenarios is a routine practice with limited military capabilities a georgian victory and occupation of tskhinvali was an impossibility from the outset and this was known and understood to us nato military planners a humanitarian disaster rather than a military victory was an integral part of the scenario the objective was to destroy the provincial capital while also inflicting a significant loss of human life if the objective were to restore georgian political control over the provincial government the operation would have been undertaken in a very different fashion with special forces occupying key public buildings communications networks and provincial institutions rather than waging an all out bombing raid on residential areas hospitals not to mention tskhinvalis university

3116413 the participants demonstrated a perception that not having to attach receipts to the return creates a temptation for electronic filers to overstate their claims for deductions and credits
3116414 there is no need to supply receipts so sometimes people may think they can get away with it without getting caught
3116415 the underestimating part could be more forgetting or not adding things up properly or maybe theyre not sure they have all their information

3116454 this woman in question has a very interesting history knowing her as this kind of bar fly who had this kind of crazy past from reading everything i read it seemed to me that she targeted edwards
3116455 why do politicians like john edwards risk their careers by having extramarital affairs
3116456 what was the trigger so i wonder if there was something about his wifes illness that somehow got him to cheat or contributed at least
3116457 well you know i think that we get so caught up in good or bad you know is somebody a good person or a bad person cheating is wrong but i think that there are multiple factors was he doing it because he had a fear of losing his wife i mean there are lots of different reasons
3116458 no i hear that there may be legitimacy to that
3116459 its possible he couldnt stop himself in the sense you know the career of politics involves all sorts of change variety novelty risk uncertainty they tend to be natural rule breakers these the folks who go in there you know if they followed the strict rules theyd have a 9 00 to 5 00 ordinary job

3116462 we played with ryan dinwiddie and got the spark we were looking for from him
3116463 i hoped to be able to get it for another game and when it was evident after two more that it wasnt happening i just felt like it was time to go back to who i believe to be our no 1 quarterback unless he was taken out and nobody knocked out the champion
3116464 he still has tremendous respect from his teammates and the coaches so well put a little bit more onus on him now that hes back and i think hes going to look forward and relish this opportunity
3116465 when he was on his game at the beginning of last year in the first half of the season it was almost to the point where he was uncanny with his accuracy
3116466 nothing has changed with his reads his release or anything like that but if im saying to kevin im looking for you to improve any one thing it would be to just be a little more accurate with your throws if he gets back to that i think hell be right at the elite of the quarterbacking corps again
3116467 now the entire team knows that he can indeed win a football game for us as our quarterback he has kept us in games he has helped us win games should we go back to him again we will have a very experienced quarterback to be able to draw from now

3116627 thames water plans also need to take account of significant population growth in an area already classed as water stressed by the
3116628 however we believe that customers will be concerned with price rises on this scale especially in light of many other household bill increases
3116629 we are concerned about the impact that thames intensified metering programme will have on certain groups of customers
3116630 the proposal of high price increases and more water meters combined with the rising cost of energy bills could hurt many households london has some of the countrys poorest areas and the government needs to seriously consider ways to help those who cannot afford to pay for their water
3116631 the consumer council for water was consulted as thames developed these plans and thames did a thorough job of consumer research while putting them together but it will take time to compare the companys pricing and investment plans against our own research to make sure that consumers receive a package of benefits over the next five years at a price that they are willing and able to pay

3116661 obama said that had he been in the u s senate two years ago he would have voted for the born alive infants protection act even though he voted against a state version of the proposal the federal version was approved the state version was not the difference between the state and federal versions obama explained was that the state measure lacked the federal language clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade the 1973 u s supreme court opinion that legalized abortion
3116662 senator obama says if he had been in the u s senate in 2002 he too would have voted in favor of the born alive infant protection act because unlike the illinois bill it included language protecting roe v wade
3116663 said he had opposed the bill because it was poorly drafted and would have threatened the supreme court decision in roe v

3116729 you can either continue to be part of the problem or be part of the solution
3116730 my struggle with drug court and other types of specialty courts is i continue to feel these are major societal problems that society refuses to deal with
3116731 if drug courts were filled with more white men than black men then i think society could see it more as a health epidemic than a crime problem
3116732 we need to recognize this for what it is this is a public health issue
3116733 society needs to deal with it in a very different manner
3116734 its great for those 13 people but as a system is it really working
3116735 if you ask me if it is working im going to tell you yes because i see people succeeding
3116736 it really is going to boil down to how people define success
3116737 doubled his sales projection for the companys new electronic book reading device known as the kindle
3116738 we cant let little countries screw around with big companies
3116739 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
3116740 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
3116741 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
3116742 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
3116743 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
3116744 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
3116745 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
3116746 our banks in good shape we dont have a foot on the brakes we have money to lend and an appetite to lend it
3116747 in gallup we have 11 5 million in capital for 110 million in assets
3116748 we are very very liquid with no funding problems whatsoever our loan to deposits ratio is very low
3116749 our business loans have grown steadily over the past five years five years ago we were down in the high 30 million
3116750 weve been pretty conservative all along if banks did business the way they should they should be pretty sound now
3116751 the family comes to gallup on a regular basis and they know the local markets
3116752 i remember three or four years ago sitting in the boardroom here with roy dinsdale chairman of the board people were saying there was a lot of money to be made in the subprime market but chairman dinsdale resisted that hes in his 80s and he grew up in the depression his family started the bank in 1933 when the only bank in their town failed i remember when the subject of subprime loans came up he said that in three or four years banks that got into the subprime market were going to be crying and now here we are chairman dinsdale positioned us well for todays conditions
3116753 i get a call at least once a day from a customer who wants to know if their deposits are safe most people think deposits are insured by fdic up to 100 000 per account but actually you can have much more as a family the coverage is for up to 100 000 per depositor so for a joint account or in some other categories deposits could be insured up to 300 000 another myth is that its 100 000 per branch so if they spread out their accounts among different branches they can get more coverage but its really 100 000 per institution which includes all the branches also if you have an ira at the bank its insured up to 250 000 another myth is that with fdic it takes forever to get your money but thats not true actually if a bank fails you would get your money pretty quickly
3116754 the best thing for customers to do is go to the web site fdic gov click on the link are my deposits insured and check out their account structure or they can come down to the bank and well help them structure their accounts to follow fdic rules
3116755 deposits are the engine that drives everything else and are the basis for the banks liquidity our bank is still growing deposits have increased every year for the last six years even when the entire market in gallup shrank our bank has grown

3116761 few people are concerned they rely on the strength of the bank washington federal has been in business since 1917 and is known as a very strong savings and loan we have weathered the great depression two world wars the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s and numerous housing cycles we are prepared for ups and downs in the mortgage business property values are holding in gallup and at a certain point it has to level out
3116762 the management team here in gallup is unique in that the whole management team is female
3116763 our two commercial lenders two mortgage lenders a consumer lender and our assistant manager are all women taken together we have close to 100 years of experience in banking

3116989 i never got invited you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am
3116990 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
3116991 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me
3116992 i won seven events if they had the 50m freestyle back then which they do now i probably would have won that too
3116993 hes almost identical to me hes a world record holder in all these events so he is dominating the events just like i did

3116995 a non muslim may not become a citizen of the maldives
3116996 this denial of citizenship to non muslims is an extraordinarily harsh measure which places the maldives among the worst countries in the world in regards to the legal foundation for freedom of religion and belief
3116997 do not envy anyone who has not been afflicted for this affair islam with a trial
3116998 passed through three khulafaa 1 whose authority stretched from the east of the earth to its west and with them were the philosophical scholars and the military commanders and the ministers and messengers and governors and administrators the amount of which can only be counted by allah so some of them sought to affect him with imprisonment and others with threats of death and other threats and others with enticement with leadership and what allah wills of money and others with beatings and some of them with expulsion and exile and he was let down in this by all the people of the earth even his friends amongst the scholars and the righteous and the pious and despite that he did not give them a word of what they asked for and he did not turn back on what he came with from the book and the sunnah
3116999 i will die in these chains of mine until a people will come and know that i have died in this state a nation who died in chains
3117000 o allah i have answered your call and they prevented me
3117001 i ask you to inform our brothers from ahlul hadeeth about my state so perhaps allah will save me through their supplications i am shackled and i am unable to perform the obligatory acts of tahaarah and salaah
3117002 look at this scholar rahimahullah he was not sorry for anything except for the performance of the obligatory deeds and he was not affected by the shackles or by the prison may allah be pleased with him and reward his patience with good
3117003 the christians have a pleasant imprisonment in it they associate partners with allah and in it they take the prisons as churches if only our imprisonment was like that of the christians and the idol worshippers no for them is dignity and for us is shame and for what sin were my brothers in religion imprisoned except lies and slander
3117004 he ibn taymiyyah would say about his imprisonment in if it was granted to them that this entire prison be filled with gold it would not be a just expression of my gratitude for this blessing or he said i would not have repaid them for the good caused to me by them and allah knows i have not seen anyone more pleased with life than he and if we became fearful or if we began to have negative thoughts or if we felt the earth had become constricted we would go to him and see him and listen to his words and all of that would leave and we would transform to a state of relief and strength and certainty
3117005 it is obligatory on the relative to free his relative from captivity

3117009 my grandfather farmed with horses and i always said that if i had a place of my own i wanted to work it with horses
3117010 when we moved here some of our neighbors thought we were amish once the word got out that we were going to farm with horses some of the others probably thought we were crazy
3117011 some people have started to come around and ask what wed charge to cultivate their tobacco with the horses
3117012 with the price of gas i really think theres a growing interest in horses as a supplement to tractors
3117013 we sort of look at the farm as a small country and that we have to balance the exports and imports so that hopefully we come out on the positive side
3117014 we take organic sustenance away from the land when we produce cattle and hay but we try to put back just as much organic value as we take away and ideally put back even more
3117015 the pigs do a really good job of converting brushy areas
3117016 they kind of disc and cultivate the soil for us and we sow grass seed behind they as they go

3117024 under glenn tiltons tenure united has gone from being the finest airline in the world with the best route structure and safety record to a shell of its former self
3117025 he has had every opportunity to turn this company around and tap the abilities of its first class employees but instead he has run it into the ground
3117026 these dismal numbers speak for themselves they are a reflection of his inability to lead his incompetence as a manager and his failure in virtually every category that can be measured we have tried every conceivable way to convince him to invest in and maximize the goodwill of his employees he has failed miserably
3117027 shrinking the airline to achieve profitability has been demonstrated to be a failed business practice

3117050 our water source hundreds of miles away is drying up if the population is growing what are our options
3117051 it may contain trace amounts of contaminants reverse osmosis and uv disinfection are very good but there are still uncertainties
3117052 why the hell do we have to drink our own sewage
3117053 its not the sun and the sky and a roaring river crashing into rocks
3117054 in the future people will laugh at us for putting it back in instead of just drinking it
3117055 if people connect the history of their water to contamination youll get a disgust response no matter how you treat that water in between
3117056 but if you enable people to frame out that history by telling them for example that the clean water has been separated from the polluted water they no longer make that connection

3117092 i dont think that anyone who attends these events wont pursue their relationship with some of what theyve heard

3117094 even as we were playing the song you sensed that serious musical computations were taking place
3117095 he said that he too played the trumpet it was just that he had never heard one that made that sound before
3117096 without wanting to seem arrogant people who turn up without having heard us find themselves won over even if they dont know what it is theyve been hearing
3117097 but there remains a whiff of postimperial guilt about our attitude to our music people think they know what english folk songs amount to but the clich of chunky knit sweaters and fingers in the ear bears little relation to the songs that form the body of english music
3117098 this music wasnt meant to be preserved in aspic its a living evolving thing but it will cease to be if people stop engaging with it

3117139 several months ago we were nervous about the impact of the financial crisis but it does not seem to have been a major impediment
3117140 i am always amazed when i hear people saying that sport creates goodwill between the nations and that if only the common peoples of the world could meet one another at football or cricket they would have no inclination to meet on the battlefield at the international level sport is frankly mimic warfare fought by nations who work themselves into furies over these absurd contests and seriously believe at any rate for short periods that running jumping and kicking a ball are tests of national virtue
3117141 as soon as strong feelings of rivalry are aroused the notion of playing the game according to the rules always vanishes
3117142 people want to see one side on top and the other side humiliated and they forget that victory gained through cheating or through the intervention of the crowd is meaningless

3117144 you can not sweet talk them into being reasonable you cant give them a warm embrace and think theyre suddenly going to become our friends
3117145 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3117146 this should be unacceptable to all the democratic countries of the world and should draw us together in universal condemnation of russian aggression

3117150 its a great thing going out there playing for your country
3117151 i had a lot of opportunities i didnt convert so that was tough
3117152 but i was winning the serves without problems he had more problems than me when he was serving so that gave me confidence
3117153 its just a matter of losing some matches where i feel like i shouldnt have lost
3117154 and then sometimes it plays a trick in your mind where you think maybe youre not playing that well actually but its actually not the case so its a matter of keeping yourself in a positive mindset
3117155 i got the feeling that bernie mac working open ended free to improvise would end up in some strange and fraught places some funny some just true
3117156 the only thing most people around here know how to do is grow sugar and play football

3117159 theres nothing really to do besides work for sugar companies and play football here i dont have to worry about it but them little kids coming up will

3117165 the judges entire analysis of what is tiffanys responsibility with respect to the site vs ebays starts from an incorrect basis
3117166 based solely on their generalized knowledge that trademark infringement might be occurring on their web sites
3117167 the fact of the matter is ebay has created the venue ebay is profiting from the venue ebay absolutely controls the venue
3117168 its ebays obligation once it has knowledge to take the knowledge to investigate and stop the sale of counterfeit merchandise
3117169 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting

3117178 what has been called the long war is likely to be many years of persistent engaged combat all around the world in differing degrees of size and intensity this generational campaign cannot be wished away or put on a timetable there are no exit strategies to paraphrase the bolshevik leon trotsky we may not be interested in the long war but the long war is interested in us
3117179 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u
3117180 the principal challenge therefore is how to ensure that the capabilities gained and counterinsurgency lessons learned from iraq and afghanistan as well as the lessons re learned from other places where we have engaged in irregular warfare over the last two decades are institutionalized within the defense establishment
3117181 if the global war on terror has produced one undeniable conclusion
3117182 it is this estimates of u s military capabilities have turned out to be wildly overstated the bush administrations misplaced confidence in the efficacy of american arms represents a strategic misjudgment that has cost the country dearly even in an age of stealth precision weapons and instant communications armed force is not a panacea even in a supposedly unipolar era american military power turns out to be quite limited
3117183 this is what i get for serving the country the monarchy and the people with hard work and dedication for six years as prime minister
3117184 i am not perfect but i insist that i am not as bad as what they accuse me of
3117185 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
3117186 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

3117188 an old time book from a girl in the back woods of maine who had a guardian angel to protect her and teach her about the real world
3117189 the book is the true story of a young girl living a very modest secluded country life in the 1950s in the state of maine she starts by explaining how country folks live life year after year then she takes you though the hard young working years and then how she was tormented mentally in all directions as she enters the real world she just couldnt believe or understand the world and its language being raised as she was in the county going to a catholic school
3117190 as more parents are choosing to home tutor their children for good reasons i found myself compelled to write my true story to help parents understand the long lasting effects of a modest sheltered upbringing before making the final decision i only wish for parents to see how a child may be affected and how these issues also need to be addressed

3117193 i think the guy calls em as he sees em and as president would call em as he sees em and would make people mad all over the place because it wouldnt fit anybodys playbook
3117194 he is not a guy who wants to be chummy chummy with political leaders of the party he doesnt like that sort of constraint hes an independent
3117195 so he somehow managed to become the nominee of the republican party but we all know its not because he was somebody that was kissing up to the republican establishment to say the least
3117196 but the notion that somehow mccain is going to get in there and be some kind of ideological newt gingrich right winger is a joke theres no way that he would do that
3117197 yes he shows temper but he burns fast and he doesnt let it cloud his judgment he would not be a loose cannon in the oval office
3117198 its not like hes going to pick up the red phone in a rage
3117199 they both have the intellectual ability and the maturity to form judgments about important policy issues id feel comfortable with both of them in there as president
3117200 they are not people who are just preening for the cameras theyre both celebrities but theyre the rare breed celebrities who are actually interested in getting things done
3117201 hes a very good legislator from my point of view because when he gets onto something he doesnt just want to introduce a bill he likes to move it and hes fearless
3117202 people couldnt believe how long we stayed on mccain feingold wed come to those press conferences year after year and you guys would laugh at us i mean literally
3117203 hes a great guy to fight an uphill battle with legislatively he keeps his word i probably shouldnt be saying this stuff but to be honest about it it was one of the better professional experiences ive ever had in my life
3117204 its unfair because mccains a blast hes fun to be around hes certainly young in spirit hes actually very young in energy
3117205 those are words that ring in the american national anthem on american licence plates in the american declaration of independence
3117206 believe on the lord jesus christ and you will be saved you and your household

3117254 i hate when they make me say words that i do not know
3117255 it makes me uncomfortable when the angels have me say a word i am not familiar with

3117275 mr jones if i didnt know better id say you were flirting with me

3117337 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
3117338 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

3117343 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
3117344 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
3117345 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
3117346 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
3117347 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
3117348 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
3117349 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
3117350 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
3117351 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
3117352 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
3117353 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
3117354 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

3117364 nein denn die lebenshaltungskosten sind drastisch gestiegen deshalb halte ich eine erh hung des regelsatzes f r erwachsene auf 418 euro pro monat durchaus f r angemessen

3117367 richtig daher appelliere ich an die energieversorger auch an vattenfall und gasag nicht nur st ndig rekordgewinne einzufahren sondern sich auch auf die soziale verantwortung zu besinnen

3117377 we appreciate you keeping rachels name out there and to keep the story going in the news but we have nothing to say they the police pretty much put us through hell and high water
3117378 there are going to be a lot of cases that this could affect
3117379 we need to make sure our laws are adequate to deal with these acts of violence we need to make sure juries hear this type of evidence
3117380 its really an emotional law rather than a well thought out law
3117381 i dont think its a wise law its going to lead to the potential for wrongful convictions which illinois has a history of because its going to allow in a lot of unreliable stuff

3117391 there is a school district meeting tuesday at 6 00 p m to continue the discussing of charter schools
3117392 by including teachers for the first time in our internship program we are helping them introduce more students to potential bioscience careers than ever before with a potential impact on more than 4 000 arizona high school students in the coming academic year
3117393 the timing couldnt have been better as more arizona high schools develop biotechnology programs teachers can use their biodesign experience to bolster their expertise and curriculum development
3117394 introducing science concepts to students this early will reap a lot of rewards for building a brain based industry like biotechnology
3117395 ive always loved science although sometimes the work can be a little difficult to explain to my parents
3117396 we didnt even extract dna when i was in college so this is all new to me
3117397 the biodesign institute is a very stimulating environment where everyone encourages you to think out of the box
3117398 my father had throat surgery for cancer when i was a little kid

3117400 im a historian of the southwest and im always interested in ways of making history accessible to the general audience

3117402 most people dont seem to be aware of the fact that the history of phoenix as a site of human civilization stretches all the way back in time to before the fall of rome
3117403 although this particular collection of historic photographs does not cover the pre mexican and anglo occupation of the area i did try to provide that sense of antiquity in my introductory chapters
3117404 the coffee table book in my opinion must serve a difficult double role it must be both visually stunning and editorially engaging it employs high resolution digital photographs that require nearly as much qualitative text to thoroughly engage the reader the judges and the abpa believe dr pag n and turner publishing skillfully achieved both of these goals
3117405 the present is a direct result of the past so understanding the past helps us better understand the present
3117406 but i fear that we in the valley generally do not appreciate our history and in fact have actively disregarded it in important ways
3117407 its hard to separate the growth of the valley from the growth of phoenix which has been nothing less than phenomenal when i was born in 1960 the population of phoenix was about 400 000 and now it is well over 1 5 million when i was young there were clear delineations between phoenix and mesa tempe chandler gilbert litchfield park peoria and so on you knew when you left one town and entered another because towns in the valley were separated by space and each had a different look and feel now those geographical delineations are all but gone and although there are still differences between many of the towns in the valley those differences are quite subtle now most of the valley in my mind at least has become a part of greater phoenix
3117408 the arizona book awards are meant to help to promote and support quality work created in or about arizona and to recognize excellence in craft and creation in the arizona book industry
3117409 we are thrilled to be spreading the word about the arizona publishing front
3117410 a central premise of this guidebook is that gang problems are local and solutions must be based on improving understanding of the nature of those problems and the immediate underlying conditions that give rise to them
3117411 widely regarded in the field for his research on gang activity dr decker offers sensible information for local agencies to use in developing responses to their specific gang problem
3117412 the reality is that most responses to problems such as gang crime do not succeed at least in their first design
3117413 it is therefore important to document the process of designing and implementing a response so that the responding jurisdiction and others can be more successful in the future
3117414 all four components of sara are critical the model requires careful analysis before creating interventions
3117415 the gang problem is highly dynamic its important to avoid developing a fixed image of a problem that does not change as the problem changes
3117416 growing evidence shows that sustained application of the sara model greatly improves the law enforcement response to gangs and leads to safer communities
3117417 the good news is that many police departments are improving their effectiveness at developing and implementing problem solving strategies
3117418 we are seeing more organizations using data based strategic responses to issues like gang crime rather than simply putting the same fire out over and over
3117419 to borrow from one of my guests there is a thrill a rush that you get in the laboratory when you discover things for the first time that is not unlike what you get surfing a 10 foot wave
3117420 this is the part of science that ask a biologist tries to capture literally in the words of the scientists themselves
3117421 the experience was very positive because most shows are too technical for the public
3117422 with the live algae we can explain to children and families how algae grow and how we extract the oil and convert it to jet fuel
3117423 however they expressed great interest in the growing algae and the potential it has for production of oil that can be used for transportation fuel especially since using algae eliminates the problem associated with converting crop foods to fuel
3117424 the critical issue is the biomass feedstock not oil conversion
3117425 to bring the cost down we need much more breakthroughs and innovations bioreactors are expensive at this stage we need a cost efficient way to sustain high growth
3117426 our effort will be geared to developing a pilot scale facility that will enable us to integrate various components of oil production and evaluate the economics of the process
3117427 since asu is a leader in developing approaches to sustainability it could for example incorporate the use of algae produced biofuels on some of its vehicles over the next several years as our production increases

3117430 i sometimes wonder what i would do without crisis in my life
3117431 im one of those people i guess who if it can happen it will but you learn to deal with it and you have to be careful not to create another crisis
3117432 i learned from faculty and staff how to juggle my familys needs with my own
3117433 ive also had to mediate difficult situations at empact spc which is something i learned through the social work program my internship with the miss foundation a non profit organization created by asu assistant professor joanne cacciatore dedicated to providing support to grieving individuals and families helped me learn to deal compassionately with raw emotion such as grief while staying focused on meeting the needs of the person and the family
3117434 what i have learned is that i can do it
3117435 it may be hard but you get there eventually even with my family were not there yet but weve come a long way
3117436 even if i were in the same position now as i was 10 years ago it wouldnt be as overwhelming because i have seen the support and where it comes from and i have grown personally and i see the light there was a time i didnt know if there was a way out
3117437 but the emphasis cant be on me because it isnt fair to those you are serving however you can share the parallel to help them understand and to let them know youve been there

3117483 os franceses dominavam e isso significa que eles precisavam aprender flamengo os flamengos instru dos falavam franc s mas a o sistema eleitoral mudou e permitiu que todos votassem e mais poder foi dado s classes m dias e baixas flamengas que n o falavam franc s
3117484 acho que isso n o vai acontecer mas pela primeira vez eu realmente acredito que a b lgica possa desaparecer

3117552 i think your experience of it is that as a psychiatric diagnosis adhd is settled upon when other ones dont seem to fit thats a bit different
3117553 why do you think we are prepared to go to such lengths
3117554 in 1948 neuropsychiatry was divided into neurology dealing with organic physical diseases of the brain and psychiatry dealing with emotional behavioral conditions in normal human beings 1 there was no such thing as a psychiatric disease then and there is no such thing today
3117555 especially those who teeter on the edge of being very unwell for a lot of their life but who are never considered ill enough to benefit from the resources that would be available in hospital

3117591 according to matthew 18 21 35 christians have no option but to forgive others however that doesnt mean to put yourself into an abusive situation

3117593 i dont know i know i forgave him but i still hurt and feel sad
3117594 this is a start of a relationship with councils in cameroon i will be talking to the local government back in uk and also develop links with vsos so this is the beginning of a long and fruitful relationship
3117595 but i must say there are similarities in some of the frustrations too
3117596 my advice is that these councils should not wait to see the implementation of programmes there are things they can be doing because they can continue working with vsos so as to develop their institutions and their local people
3117597 the workshop we held with the mp that focused on institutional capacity building was timely because most of the councils are very young and they hardly understand what they have to do thus we are grateful to vsos that seek for appropriate people to work with us

3117617 if the democratic party wants to appeal to moral values they should start with a pro life stance
3117618 it is not just about the pro life issue but the many other issues that the democrats stand for
3117619 most democrats hold secular humanistic positions that are contrary to the bible

3117623 we need to start again from zero with a new mentality with a new direction with a new culture
3117624 i think if the jews and the muslims and the christians and our parliament if we start speaking about a culture of peace a culture of reconciliation one day we can have peace its a question of the human element more than the instrument change the mentality
3117625 everybody now i think is tired tired tired i said often in my interviews we need courageous people doing courageous gestures to get to this peace although i respect everybody i am not sure we have these leaders today
3117626 we think it is the wish for us to have children playing together eat together study together in the same school

3117650 a point of confusion seems to be whether there is a gap of time between the beginning of universe and the of adam
3117651 the years of generations between adam and jesus equal about 4 000
3117652 ill move now you stay right there and tell me how much the leaves separate
3117653 thats not what is called in a court of law a responsive answer
3117654 you do i dont know this one youre talking about
3117655 i guess i dont either now that you mention it
3117656 tell the truth then no sense in going around and around about it hell think that i and the like ill think what i think whatever you say or go down the mountain and just dont say any more
3117657 try the truth then if its important its simple and if its simple its easy to say
3117658 i remember when i was a kid there was a fire scare in the apartment house where we lived it was a wild scramble to get out and my ten year old brother found himself outside in the street with an alarm clock in his hand it was an old one and it didnt work but of all the things in the place he might have snatched up at a time like that it turned out to be the clock hes never been able to figure out why
3117659 not why he picked that particular thing no but i think i know why he did something obviously irrational you see panic is a very special state like fear and flight or fury and attack its a pretty primitive reaction to extreme danger its one of the expressions of the will to survive what makes it so special is that its irrational now why would the abandonment of reason be a survival mechanism
3117660 unless its because in some situations reason just doesnt work
3117661 and you just did if you are in danger and you try reason and reason doesnt work you abandon it you cant say its unintelligent to abandon what doesnt work right so then you are in panic you start to perform random acts most of them far and away most will be useless some might even be dangerous but that doesnt in danger already where the survival factor comes in is that away down deep you know that one chance in a million is better than no chance at all so here you scared and you could run something says you should run but you wont
3117662 you found a lump you went to a doctor and he made some tests and gave you the bad news maybe you went to another doctor and he confirmed it you then did some research and found out what was to happen next the exploratory the radical the question able recovery the whole long agonizing procedure of being what they call a terminal case you then flipped out did some things you hope i wont ask you about took a trip somewhere anywhere wound up in my orchard for no reason
3117663 panic the reason for little boys in their pajamas standing at midnight with a broken alarm clock in their arms and for the existence of quacks
3117664 im not a quack by the way to qualify as a quack you have to claim to be a doctor i dont
3117665 a long shiny sharp needle dont tell me you are one of those needle shy people
3117666 id rather you didnt because this pharmaceutical stew is complex enough as it is but if you need it
3117667 its mostly built around an isotope of potassium if i told you all i know about it and how i came on it in the first place it would take well more time than weve got but heres the general idea theoretically every atom is electrically balanced never mind ordinary exceptions likewise all electrical charges in the molecule are supposed to be balanced so much plus so much minus total zero i happened on the fact that the balance of charges in a wild cell is not zero not quite its as if there were a submicroscopic thunderstorm going on at the molecular level with little lightning bolts flashing back and forth and changing the signs interfering with communications static and that
3117668 is what this is all about when something interferes with communications especially the rna mechanism that says read this blueprint build accordingly and stop when its done when that message gets garbled lopsided things get built off balance things things that do almost what they should do it almost wild cells and the messages they pass on are even worse
3117669 okay whether these thunderstorms are caused by viruses or chemicals or radiation or physical trauma or even anxiety and dont think anxiety cant do it is secondary the important thing is to fix it so the thunderstorm cant happen if you can do that the cells have plenty of ability all by themselves to repair and replace whats gone wrong and biological systems arent like ping pong balls with static charges waiting for the charge to leak away or to discharge into a grounded wire they have a kind of resilience i call it forgiveness that enables them to take on a little more charge or a little less and do all right well then say a certain clump of cells is wild and say it carries an aggregate of a hundred units extra on the positive side cells immediately around it are affected but not the next layer or the next
3117670 if they could be opened to the extra charge if they could help to drain it off they would well cure the wild cells of the surplus you see what i mean and they would be able to handle that little overage themselves or pass it on to other cells and still others who could deal with it in other words if i can flood your body with a medium that can drain off and distribute a concentration of this unbalanced charge the ordinary bodily processes will be free to move in and clear up the wild cell damage and thats what i have here
3117671 i am not for one second implying that nuclear charges in the atom are the same thing as static electricity theyre in a different league altogether but the analogy holds i could use another analogy i could liken the charge in the wild cells to accumulations of fat and this gunk of mine to a detergent that would break it up and spread it so far it couldnt be detected any more but im led to the static analogy by an odd side effect organisms injected with this stuff do build up one hell of a static charge its a byproduct and for reasons i can only theorize about at the moment it seems to be keyed to the audio spectrum tuning forks and the like thats what i was playing with when i met you that tree is drenched with this stuff it used to have a whorl of wild cell growth it hasnt any more
3117672 please dont move im sorry this will take a little time i have to get quite a lot of this into you which is fine you know
3117673 because side effect or no its consistent healthy bio systems develop a strong electrostatic field unhealthy ones a weak one or none at all with an instrument as primitive and simple as that little electroscope you can tell if any part of the organism has a community of wild cells and if so where it is and how big and how wild
3117674 and if youre wondering why this mosquito has a housing on it with a wire attached although ill bet youre not and that you know as well as i do that im doing all this talking just to keep your mind occupied ill tell you its nothing but a coil carrying a high frequency alternating current the alternating field sees to it that the fluid is magnetically and electrostatically neutral right from the start
3117675 like the owner of a large sleeping hysteria begging someone not to wake it up
3117676 in a little while you are going to feel so weird you wont have time for hysteria
3117677 when i was in junior high school they were generating artificial lightning with a let me see well it had a long endless belt running over pulleys and some little wires scraping on it and a big copper ball on top
3117678 right and they did all sorts of things with it but what i specially remember is standing on a piece of wood on a bowl like that and they charged me up with the generator i didnt feel much of anything except all my hail stood out from my head everyone laughed i looked like a golliwog they said i was carrying forty thousand volts
3117679 good im glad you remember that thisll be a little different though by roughly another forty thousand
3117680 dont worry as long as youre insulated and as long as grounded or comparatively grounded objects me for example stay well away from you there wont be any fireworks
3117681 not like that and i already did youre the generator
3117682 you sure are and more than i bought and quicker get up
3117683 you are an electroscope you know that and a living van de graaf generator as well and a golliwog
3117684 not yet please hang tight the differential between you and everything else here is so high that if you got near any of it youd discharge into it it wouldnt harm you it isnt current electricity but you might get a burn and a nervous shock out of it
3117685 youre sending such a strong field i cant pick up the variations
3117686 some things that have to be done just arent consistent with pantyhose and a minidress all washed and dried and ready for you though any time over there
3117687 you went into shock and then you just didnt come out of it
3117688 the pear tree the electroscope the injection the electrostatic response
3117689 dont slip off again you can handle it you can handle it because its all right now do you understand that youre all right
3117690 there wasnt anything in what i did that could cause a three day withdrawal like that it had to be something in you
3117691 comes from being right so much of the time took a bit more for granted than i should have didnt i when i assumed youd been to a doctor maybe even had a biopsy you hadnt had you
3117692 my mother died of it and my aunt and my sister had a radical mastectomy
3117693 when i told you what you already knew and what you never wanted to hear you couldnt take it you blacked right out you know fainted away and it had nothing to do with the seventy odd thousand volts of static you were carrying i caught you
3117694 but at least you didnt crack your head or anything
3117695 do go back home wherever that is pick up your life again whatever that might mean
3117696 when are you going to get it into your head that what i did was not a diagnostic
3117697 i mean youre curing it right now i explained it all to you before you remember that now dont you
3117698 if i bopped you over the head with a bat
3117699 there would be a lump on it it would be there tomorrow and the next day the day after that it might be smaller in a week youd still be able to feel it but it would be gone same thing here
3117700 i can tell by looking at you that i am going to have to listen to that speech again well i wont
3117701 the one about my duty to humanity it comes in two phases and many textures phase one has to do with my duty to humanity and really means we could make a classic buck with it phase two deals solely with my duty to humanity and i dont hear that one very often phase two utterly overlooks the reluctance humanity has to accept good things unless they arrive from accepted and respectable sources phase one is fully aware of this but gets rat shrewd in figuring ways around it
3117702 are accompanied by the light of revelation with or without religion and or mysticism or they are cast sternly in the ethical philosophy mold and aim to force me to surrender through guilt mixed to some degree all the way up to total with compassion
3117703 everybody has his own commercial your nutritionist would have nodded over his wheat germ or his macrobiotic rice cakes your priest would have dropped to his knees and looked at the sky your geneticist would have a pet theory about generation skipping and would assure you that your grandparents probably had spontaneous remissions too and never knew it
3117704 do you know what i am i am an engineer twice over mechanical and electrical and i have a law degree if you were foolish enough to tell anyone about what has happened here which i hope you if you are i know how to protect myself i could be jailed for practicing medicine without a license you could have me up for assault because i stuck a needle into you and even for kidnapping if you could prove i carried you in here from the lab nobody would give a damn that i had cured your cancer you dont know who i am do you
3117705 and i wont tell you i dont know your name either
3117706 dont tell me dont tell me i dont want to hear it i wanted to be involved with your lump and i was i want it and you to be gone as soon as youre both up to it have i made myself absolutely clear
3117707 i was going to say i was grateful would that have been all right sir
3117708 that would be fine although you wont really be grateful for another ten days when you get your spontaneous remission reports or maybe for six months or a year or two or five when examinations keep on testing out negative
3117709 and that just doesnt happen any more if it ever did
3117710 its dark and you dont know the way ill see you in the morning
3117711 you made me bite my tongue i thought youd gone
3117712 but then i stopped to be with the tree for a while
3117713 im not going to any doctor to get this thing checked out i didnt want to leave until i had told you that and until i was sure you believed me
3117714 i believe you i dont know why you decided as you did but im willing to believe you
3117715 i thought you ought to have it at least once in your life so you can never say again what you said
3117716 you tell me im very serious about this why are you angry
3117717 where do you suppose all this came from the house the land the equipment
3117718 a way of guiding exhaust gases out of internal combustion engines in such a way that they are given a spin unburned solids are embedded in the walls of the muffler in a glass wool liner that slips out in one piece and can be replaced by a clean one every couple of thousand miles the rest of the exhaust is fired by its own spark plug and what will bum burns the heat is used to preheat the fuel the rest is spun again through a five thousand mile cartridge what finally gets out is by todays standards at least pretty clean and because of the preheating it actually gets better mileage out of the engine
3117719 but not because the thing is being used to cut down air pollution
3117720 ive been up against that all my life i have something in my head that just wont quit its a way i have of asking the next question why is so and so the way it is why cant it be such and such instead there is always another question to be asked about anything or any situation especially you shouldnt quit when you like an answer because theres always another one after it and we live in a world where people just dont want to ask the next question
3117721 ive been paid all my stomach will take for things people wont use and if im mad all the time its really my fault i admit it because i just cant stop asking that next question and coming up with answers there are a half dozen real block busters in that lab that nobody will ever see and half a hundred more in my head but what can you do in a world where people would rather kill each other in a desert even when theyre shown it can turn green and bloom where theyll fall all over themselves to pour billions into developing a new oil strike when its been proved over and over again that the fossil fuels will kill us all yes im angry shouldnt i be
3117722 maybe youre asking the next question instead of asking the right question i think people who live by wise old sayings are trying not to think but i know one worth paying some attention to its this if you ask a question the right way youve just given the answer
3117723 i mean if you put your hand on a hot stove you might ask yourself how can i stop my hand from burning and the answer is pretty clear isnt it if the world keeps rejecting what you have to some way of asking why that contains the answer
3117724 oh i cant tell you that all i know is that the way you do something where people are concerned is more important than what you do if you want results i mean you already know how to get what you want with the tree dont you
3117725 people are living growing things too i dont know a hundredth part of what you do about bonsai but i do know this when you start one it isnt often the strong straight healthy ones you take its the twisted sick ones that can be made the most beautiful when you get to shaping humanity you might remember that
3117726 of all the i dont know whether to laugh in your face or punch you right in the mouth
3117727 come on now you know a figure of speech when you hear one
3117728 then iii do it for you you said i was angry and afraid you want to know what im afraid of
3117729 ill say what i know youre thinking im afraid of any close human relationship im afraid of something i cant take apart with a screwdriver or a mass spectroscope or a table of cosines and tangents i dont know how to handle it
3117730 or by turning it just so in the sun you handle it as if it were a living thing like a species or a woman or a bonsai it will be what you want it to be if you let it be itself and take the time and the care
3117731 that you are making me some kind of offer why
3117732 i had a crazy kind of image do you think two sick twisted trees ever made bonsai out of one another

3117745 the traditional council never sat down to designate molinga as a king maker
3117746 with continued high commodity prices record foreign exchange reserves hardly any external debt and budget surpluses the situation today could hardly be more different than 1998 this has led to strong capital inflows especially over the past few years and a massive expansion of the banking industry with both domestic and foreign banks greatly increasing their activities
3117747 it is all very well to say that the economy can withstand a fall in oil price to 50 per barrel in financial terms but much of the success or failure of this next phase in the development will depend on investor and consumer confidence and a great deal will depend on effective management by the government
3117748 a falling oil price has tested both in the past without any meaningful progress in reducing the dependency on oil revenues it surely will again
3117749 following the match against argentina bakkies botha had a scan and he has ruptured his posterior cruciate ligament in his left knee
3117750 we will adopt a conservative management process which means bakkies will not undergo surgery but will rather complete a rehabilitation process

3117813 so obviously my first responsibility is my relationship with the lord and my relationship with my wife and five children
3117814 then it comes to my work here in the government with the president and he has been very supportive of my married and family life
3117815 there were a number of misconceptions and fears surrounding the faith based community initiative when president bush first launched it
3117816 i think a lot of the miscommunication was intentional attempting to undermine what the president was trying to do so we had to spend a good amount of time dismantling those fears and correcting the misconceptions
3117817 out to the country where communities know the importance of their faith based groups and they dont fear faith
3117818 so i feel like the president made a lot of progress in the midst of relentless opposition

3117828 weve had a car culture for so long and suddenly the roads become saturated with bicyclists trying to save gas
3117829 thats the first time one of them actually beeped at me usually they run you down silently
3117830 he says im lucky he was looking out for me because i dont belong in the most busiest city in the world on my bicycle
3117831 they say the cyclists are all over the road and dont know the rules
3117832 they dont signal i get that there is safety in numbers and theyre trying to protect themselves but theres barely room for cars on the road let alone a bike lane
3117833 you cant ride a bike in the city as an adult the way you did as a 10 year old in a suburban cul de sac
3117834 i see people riding like children on a sidewalk or going the wrong way down a street
3117835 a guy riding his bike without a helmet talking on his cellphone with his kid in the bike attachment behind him
3117836 we need to find some way to let them know what the rules are
3117837 mention the noon riders to anyone in town and youll see the blood pressure go up
3117838 i slammed on the brakes and they swarmed around me screaming and yelling obscenities my heart was pounding it was very scary

3117840 the north american church is in need of bolstering its conviction based upon the scriptures and taking courageous actions spirit led actions
3117841 there are more fires burning today seemingly out of control than every before in our nation in terms of issues that desperately need couples laymen and women teenagers and boys and girls to take a stand for christ
3117842 i believe the spiritual condition of our nation is certainly in the pulpit but it is most certainly as well in the pew
3117843 weve got to empower laymen to make a difference where they live and begin to push back against the culture and stand for righteousness
3117844 i personally believe materialism today is sapping the strength from the christian community in ways we dont even realize theres more christian wealth today than there has ever been in the history of the church and yet there are evil things that seem to be compounding daily in growth
3117845 one of the achilles heels of the local church is that weve accepted divorce as an alternative one of the reasons for this is that many pastors feel they cannot preach on marriage or family either because their own marriage and family is in such dire need of revival or because theyre afraid theyre going to offend the people in their churches and lose their jobs
3117846 one of the great things is that this event has already been a success because there are a number of churches that have agreed that they are not going to marry couples unless they sign up for covenant marriage
3117847 its very easy to start to think youre untouchable i think its through a vigilant pursuit of seeking to be accountable to other people and making sure you do not get too big for someone to disagree with you

3117854 in fact we say that the stores are focused on their customers and should be servants to their customers therefore we at the corporate office see ourselves as servants to the stores
3117855 you should not expect something from someone that you are not willing to do yourself we should set the example of integrity and serving the customer
3117856 all the things we do all our behavior should let others know that we are living by and operating in biblical principles principle and character are the highest quality traits on our list
3117857 we are more profitable than other stores within this industry because of this we believe that we should pay above average salaries we examine each specific position and pay according to that positions responsibility
3117858 there is no success outside of success with the lord
3117859 the answer is still the same prayer yes god did give us some talents but who do these talents really belong to they are gods we are completely dependent upon him
3117860 we are also the only company of this size other than chic fil a that is closed on sundays
3117861 we do that for them customers as well as our employees who are there all day because it is very uplifting to them too
3117862 our organization wants to be remembered as one that knows the difference between temporal and eternal
3117863 our business is only a means to an end and our end is to try to affect lives for eternity if we havent done that then we are just merely a good person

3117869 thats the one thing i can keep secret in my life
3117870 put it behind you and move on with your life
3117871 what have i done wrong to be punished like this
3117872 churches use the concept of forgiveness to short circuit the survival empowerment process the church cannot bear to hear about child sexual abuse so the quicker a child forgives the easier it is for the listener
3117873 in the person of christ as head pope pius xii enunciated the traditional teaching even more directly in his encyclical
3117874 many of us feel as if we had been raped by god
3117875 and to commit ourselves more fully to the search for holiness
3117876 devastated spirituality the impact of clergy sexual abuse on the survivors relationship with god and the church
3117877 a canon a choirboy and homosexuality in late sixteenth century italy a case study
3117878 this church is in essence an unequal society that is to say a society comprising two categories of persons the shepherds and the flock
3117879 christianity and child sexual abuse the survivors voice leading to change
3117880 throughout history and in every segment of society the most common response to the suspicion or even the disclosure of childhood sexual abuse has been self defensive denial and dissociation no one finds it easy to stand in the overwhelming and destabilizing reality of sexual abuse
3117881 i would also draw your attention to another aspect of the whole question while acknowledging the right to due freedom of information one cannot acquiesce in treating moral evil as an occasion for sensationalism public opinion often feeds on sensationalism and the mass media play a particular role therein in fact the search for sensationalism leads to the loss of something which is essential to the morality of society
3117882 my biggest challenge is to consistently meet the demands and expectations of all our
3117883 then you must trust empower and motivate your people it is imperative that a company have positive leadership a favorable environment and conditions where employees can do their jobs effectively
3117884 values are critically important because they stay with the company for decades long after the chairman or ceo retire
3117885 integrity and ethics are among the responsibilities of all our corporate leadership especially myself integrity and ethics must be evident in not only our personal lives but also in our professional conduct before they can be instilled in our employees worldwide leading by example is how we do things here in my case these values are shared with business partners customers and suppliers as well as with many international heads of state
3117886 in the i was in syria speaking with president hafez al assad who died in june 2000 the father of the current president bashar al assad
3117887 hey this guy dunham has been here talking about conoco and telling me all about the things they did in venezuela did they do it
3117888 accountability is interwoven throughout the whole process of our daily activities and is part of the compensation program for employees and management
3117889 it all starts with the president chairman or ceo and runs throughout every level of our organization values should stay with the company even though there are organizational and or personnel changes
3117890 well you have a real job of training in those situations

3117897 that we might glorify god by being a faithful steward in all that is entrusted to our care and that we might have a positive influence on all the people that we might come in contact with
3117898 we began to ask ourselves some hard and important questions like
3117899 we started an incentive program for our operators who reached an increase of 40 percent or greater in annual sales
3117900 in 1983 we began our relationship with berry college through which we initiated a scholarship program to attract chick fil a employees to the college
3117901 about twenty years ago back in 1982 we had some difficulties here at chick fil a our business was being hurt by other major chains getting into the chicken breast sandwich business this was the same year that we moved into our corporate headquarters and were paying on a 10 million loan
3117902 a persons morals are demonstrated daily through our personal lives in my personal life i really try to live up to our corporate purpose
3117903 selecting the right people is a big responsibility making sure you have the right people with the right qualities for the job when we select managers and leaders we look first at the persons character
3117904 we evaluate each person as an individual and the importance of honesty and integrity is understood by them up front because of our company benefits one of which is being off on sundays chick fil a is able to attract hundreds of good honorable employees and by having good people our problems are kept to a minimum
3117905 to emphasize our beliefs about responsibility at the workplace and at home we sponsor an annual seminar for our employees at which i remind them that the worst thing that could happen to chick fil a is for them to get divorced from their family

3117916 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3117917 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3117918 hundreds of papers on both the causal link and the question of sensitivity
3117919 i guess the biggest challenge as a business leader is to establish appropriate priorities then properly direct our efforts to maintain them it is very easy to go off on tangents and over commit in areas that are not really your main priority
3117920 to glorify god as we supply our customers worldwide with top quality value priced batteries related electrical power source products and distribution services
3117921 the top executives within this company are in agreement to daily personify it periodically we have a professor from dallas seminary speak to our vice presidents on the issues of integrity honesty etc we also provide written material to all our leaders pertaining to our corporate values and beliefs
3117922 well i say that i came to christ under duress
3117923 i began to read the bible actually what i did was an apologetic study of the bible
3117924 then i began to read the bible to see what it said about me
3117925 i am a seeker and your word says that i shall not may find
3117926 from there i went on to discover that jesus christ is the way the truth and the life i learned that i was a sinner separated from god because of my own behavior and faults i knew i was a sinner even without reading it in the bible i knew it in my heart it was in may of 1974 that i prayed and received jesus christ i have never been the same since
3117927 as i said earlier we do believe that our faith should be out front and we want to exercise it boldly but with sensitivity

3117933 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3117934 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3117935 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3117936 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3117937 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3117938 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3117939 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3117940 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3117941 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3117942 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3117943 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3117944 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3117945 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3117946 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3117947 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3117948 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3117949 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3117950 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3117951 who are open to doing something on the production side
3117952 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3117953 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3117954 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3117955 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3117956 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3117957 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3117958 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3117959 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3117960 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3117961 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3117962 if any restaurant in belfast wants to make me a waiter for a night ill do it with the best of my ability and ill write a feature up on it
3117963 do your homework send a thank you note and wear a suit
3117964 well i just do it my son played high school baseball and i rarely missed a game my daughter is a cheerleader and ive never missed a home game i have an important job but its not more important than being a father i go to pep rallies and am the hokey daddy down there with the video camera
3117965 so my children grew up in a relatively normal neighborhood and their daddy worked for the government like everyone else here in town thats been a blessing because my children have not been treated very differently
3117966 well we passed the defense of marriage act in texas i signed the bill passed by the legislature obviously campaigning for this but it is clear that the people are for sending a message that marriage in texas and the united states is between a man and a woman
3117967 the problem is that another state by virtue of an activist judge or judges can create a gay marriage situation where we would be forced in texas to recognize that this is the reason i dont have a problem with a national constitutional amendment if activist judges did what they are suppose to do to interpret the law not make law then we wouldnt have these problems but the fact of the matter is that i support the presidents efforts on the constitutional amendment because we in texas have said what we believe in and what the law is but some other state may try to force their interpretation onto us and thats where i dig my heels in pretty deep im for a constitutional amendment if thats what its going to take to control activist judges
3117968 faith is both a private thing and a very public thing for me private in the sense that every morning i get up and read a little scripture
3117969 faith in a public way is how my wife and i live our lives how we express our christian faith in our acts so everyday we publicly display and privately absorb our christian beliefs
3117970 the scripture talks about praying incessantly its not out of the ordinary for me to have a word of prayer in the midst of a meeting when the door closes in here and its quiet for two minutes i say my prayers for my family or for something thats going on in the world
3117971 the holy spirit works in interesting ways to remind you about what to pray for god knows what your needs are prayer is a daily occurrence i pray a lot in my life i dont carve out an hour or thirty minutes to pray in my closet but i have a very active prayer life
3117972 i also know that there are tens of thousands of people praying for me and my family it is a powerful thing to know that there are people of faith who are fervently praying for you for your well being for your strength and for your wisdom
3117973 the uacs goal in this project is to raise awareness because most people have no idea what sharia law is
3117974 we are confident people will see the billboard and learn on their own what sharia law is and come to their own conclusions at the very least we hope our billboard will spark public debate on this overlooked issue
3117975 under sharia law if you are accused of stealing a hand and foot from opposite sides are amputated if you are caught having an affair the woman is stoned to death and the man is given 80 lashes if you change religions you can be charged under apostasy laws and given the death sentence by a legal sharia court if you want to marry a nine year old child sharia law condones pedophilia because mohammad married aisha at six and consummated the marriage at age nine i find these and many more practices of sharia law despicable and hateful
3117976 sharia is the glue that holds an islamic society together
3117977 the harsh punishments associated with sharia law in all facets of day to day life create a never ending atmosphere of abject fear for those living under sharia law
3117978 for those people calling me hateful then they would have to condone child marriages amputations for stealing and death for apostates to name only a few punishments attached to sharia law if my critics condone this type of activity under any circumstances then it is they who are hateful towards anyone who is non muslim and should look into their own mirror before crying hate speech
3117979 im going to open up this case im going to sue cair im bringing a lawsuit back against them its going to cost me a fortune
3117980 and when judge illston rejects it again which she will do because shes a minion of the bill clinton crowd im going to take it over her head and im going to go to the 9th circuit court of appeals where again im going to hit a stonewall and then im going to take it to the supreme court
3117981 how theyre targeting the midwest talk radio one talk show host at a time one company at a time dont you know that cair is going to come for you
3117982 first they came for michel savage and you didnt raise your voice and you laughed then they came after abercrombie and fitch and you didnt raise your voice because you werent in the retail business tomorrow theyll come after you and your business
3117983 one day youre going to hit the wrong judge in the wrong city at the wrong time and then the american people are going to find out where your funding is coming from
3117984 individuals entities who are and or were members of the us muslim brotherhoods palestine committee and or its organizations
3117985 cairs operational budget is funded by donations from american muslims
3117986 there is nothing criminal or immoral about accepting donations from foreign nationals
3117987 the u s government corporations and non profit organizations routinely receive money from foreign nationals
3117988 bin talal is not a member of the saudi arabian government
3117989 as long as they are not an official of any foreign government and there are no strings attached to the bequest
3117990 youre looking at a cinematic device employed by zhang yimou here this is actually almost animation a footstep a second 29 in all to signify the 29 olympiads
3117991 we said earlier that aspects of this opening ceremony are almost like cinema in real time well this is quite literally cinematic
3117992 this is a digitally manufactured shot to represent whats happening right now outside the stadium
3117993 the audience makeup of the olympics is very much like that of american idol and dancing with the stars which have live season finales presented in much the same way
3117994 you assume theres a large amount of intelligence in the viewing audience so when they see those twice an hour time stamps theyll understand what is being presented
3117995 that is because the recovery in crude oil is momentary there is some amount of demand fall and that could bring it down
3117996 gold is bearish as the dollar has gained a lot
3117997 there is a good support for gold and crude around their current levels
3117998 global inflationary pressures are still pretty high so one cant be bearish on gold
3117999 if we want to fix this in something less than a three year time horizon which i hope we want to do it has to be done in the very near term
3118000 each day that passes takes us further and further away from the preparedness to compromise that was certainly evident in that last week of july for much of the time
3118001 what is the worst thing you can call a man bitch girl pussy etc is that not royally fucked up
3118002 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
3118003 in the wrong hands robot law enforcement could be a major blow to individual privacy and basic human rights
3118004 much bigger role in society over the next 75 years than previously anticipated
3118005 taliban launched a big attack on tor ghundi fort and iskandro post in bajaur security forces responded and 20 militants were killed
3118006 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3118007 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3118008 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3118009 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3118010 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3118011 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3118012 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3118013 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3118014 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3118015 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3118016 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3118017 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3118018 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3118019 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3118020 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3118021 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3118022 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3118023 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3118024 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3118025 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3118026 russia was left with the choice of either becoming a traitor or an aggressor
3118027 that only a union between one man and one woman may be a marriage valid in or recognized by this commonwealth and its political subdivisions this commonwealth and its political subdivisions shall not create or recognize a legal status for relationships of unmarried individuals that intends to approximate the design qualities significance or effects of marriage nor shall this commonwealth or its political subdivisions create or recognize another union partnership or other legal status to which is assigned the rights benefits obligations qualities or effects of marriage
3118028 the amendment ratified november 7 2006 and effective january 1 2007 added a new section 15 a
3118029 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3118030 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3118031 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3118032 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3118033 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3118034 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3118035 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3118036 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3118037 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3118038 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3118039 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3118040 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3118041 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3118042 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3118043 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3118044 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3118045 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3118046 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3118047 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3118048 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3118049 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3118050 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3118051 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3118052 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3118053 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3118054 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3118055 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3118056 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3118057 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3118058 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3118059 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3118060 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3118061 we came out of the tunnel into the big arena that made it official i guess
3118062 my first year of high school i was on the jv team
3118063 it was a shallow pool and we were just messing around with a ball that had a grip on it no one had any idea what they were doing i just liked the way it combined my background in swimming with ball sports
3118064 then we had a team meeting about two hours before the game and it really started to get intense
3118065 the first goal is to survive the bracket but we realize thats no longer the goal we want to shoot for
3118066 we want to win the bracket to me a gold medal is the ultimate goal
3118067 hed be in school with us then hed leave for a couple weeks and wed hear stories when he came back

3118132 recebemos uma carta da miss o da ge rgia pedindo a convoca o de uma reuni o e vamos consider la
3118133 o estado falido de maior sucesso de todos os tempos
3118134 n o existia toda essa divis o quando eu era mais jovem os manifestantes gritam em nossas reuni es franceses saiam do nosso territ rio as autoridades flamengas se recusam a contratar professores que falam franc s eles d o s crian as flamengas 179 euros por ano para viagens escolares e outras despesas e s 68 euros para crian as francesas se queremos obter subs dios somos obrigados a estocar nossa biblioteca com 75 dos livros em flamengo mas rid culo ter uma biblioteca flamenga em uma cidade cuja maioria dos habitantes fala franc s
3118135 na b lgica as duas culturas conhecem muito pouco sobre a outra porque falam l nguas diferentes existem por exemplo cantores que s o famosos em uma parte na outra n o a televis o diferente os jornais os livros
3118136 existem 6 milh es de falantes do holand s eles se irritam com a influ ncia franc fona mas ao mesmo tempo n o se importam com a influ ncia da cultura inglesa ou anglo sax nica
3118137 ent o a coisa n o racional esquecemos nossa verdadeira hist ria cultural no s culo quinze bruges era a cidade mais vibrante fora da it lia porque estava cheia de estrangeiros depois foi antu rpia quando os estrangeiros deixaram bruges hoje o movimento nacional nos flandres nega totalmente seu passado
3118138 naquela poca os franc fonos n o desejavam um pa s bil ng e
3118139 os franceses dominavam e isso significa que eles precisavam aprender flamengo os flamengos instru dos falavam franc s mas a o sistema eleitoral mudou e permitiu que todos votassem e mais poder foi dado s classes m dias e baixas flamengas que n o falavam franc s
3118140 acho que isso n o vai acontecer mas pela primeira vez eu realmente acredito que a b lgica possa desaparecer
3118141 os flamengos hoje veneram seus escritores porque para eles a l ngua um s mbolo de independ ncia
3118142 fiquei chocado em saber que meus colegas que falam franc s n o conheciam seus vizinhos
3118143 me explicou da seguinte forma a regi o dos flandres n o tem nada em comum com a holanda a n o ser a l ngua mas quase n o existe comunica o entre as duas l nguas exceto atrav s do rock que todos cantam em ingl s e dos esportes que ultrapassam qualquer barreira

3118260 this ground breaking discovery confirms what researchers and experts have believed for some time mitochondrial disease is not rare
3118261 we now know that 1 in 200 people carry the mutation for this horrible debilitating disease this discovery underscores the need for additional research funding to help better diagnose and treat affected individuals and to learn more about how mitochondrial dysfunction is connected to other diseases
3118262 the demonstration by dr chinnery and colleagues that at least one in 200 newborns harbor known pathogenic mitochondrial dna mutations indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction is a major underlying risk factor for human disease
3118263 this new observation augments the rapidly expanding body of evidence indicating that common mitochondrial dna lineages modulate the risk for developing a wide variety of diseases including diabetes cardiovascular disease parkinson disease alzheimer disease various cancers as well as longevity
3118264 dr chinnerys research raises many new questions none of which can be answered without additional dollars allocated for research into mitochondrial disease and dysfunction
3118265 this line of research holds great promise ultimately the investment we make may enable doctors and researchers to transform medicine benefiting not only those suffering from mitochondrial disease but the many millions of americans who suffer from the wide range of diseases related to mitochondrial dysfunction

3118303 if brain damage related to alzheimers disease begins earlier in adult life then having less reserve due to a smaller brain could compromise intellectual ability in those destined to get alzheimers and lead to them getting less education
3118304 although it has been known for many years that individuals with lower education have a greater risk of getting alzheimers this is the first report showing that reduced educational attainment may actually be an early sign of the underlying disease
3118305 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety

3118307 sometimes we love people so much that we have to be numb to it because if we actually felt how much we love them it would kill us
3118308 what the hell i got that you want ive never done a damn thing
3118309 everyone has internal damnation waiting to rear and wreak its vindictive and sadistic means
3118310 we are stepping up and doing what we need to do to straighten this thing out
3118311 there are two good people that for different reasons arent part of this organization today and thats a shame
3118312 the fact is the players have to look deep inside themselves and understand they have to be responsible for some of this
3118313 the galaxy hasnt made the playoffs for a couple years punting on this season is not acceptable it starts thursday
3118314 sometimes we love people so much that we have to be numb to it because if we actually felt how much we love them it would kill us
3118315 this is a victory for californias students parents and education community this decision confirms the right every california child has to a quality education and the right parents have to decide what is best for their children
3118316 i hope the ruling settles this matter for parents and home schooled children once and for all in california but assure them that we as elected officials will continue to defend parents rights
3118317 as head of californias public school system it would be my wish that all children attend public school but i understand that a traditional public school environment may not be the right setting for each and every child
3118318 i recognize and understand the consternation that the earlier court ruling caused for many parents and associations involved in home schooling it is my hope that todays ruling will allay many of those fears and resolve much of the confusion
3118319 he gets to keep his love of learning alive the world is his classroom
3118320 this court was under pressure they did it to protect themselves and their reputation those judges want to be supreme court judges they want to move up theyre not going to do anything to upset their careers
3118321 educating your children in your own home preexisted these buffoons that sit on the 2nd circuit
3118322 it preexisted this state it preexisted us parents have been teaching their own children since the beginning
3118323 it is important to recognize that it is not for us to consider as a matter of policy whether home schooling should be permitted in california that job is for the legislature it is not the duty of the courts to make the law we endeavor to interpret it
3118324 our first task interpreting the law of california is made more difficult in this case by legislative inaction
3118325 given the states compelling interest in educating all of its children and the absence of an express statutory and regulatory framework for home schooling in california additional clarity in this area of the law would be helpful

3118342 upon receipt of that intelligence we visited the site where one nabie santigie dumbuya was caught cutting the scrap he was arrested
3118343 when we interrogated doctor shen he admitted contracting santigie to cut the metals into pieces after he completed arrangement with the proprietor of gava for the purchase of the old machine he further stated that owie told him that he was selling the machines so that the industry could buy new ones
3118344 well you can say that im the one curly fry in the box of the regular
3118345 were there to listen to understand what happened he said monday adding that the police would like
3118346 one thing is for sure we have to do better than what weve been doing
3118347 we only know what we see in the news in the newspapers thats all
3118348 what we are seeing are youngsters a community that is in revolt because they dont like they way they are being treated
3118349 hes got a photographic memory or very close to it
3118350 you think hes sleeping there in the meetings and he still knows everything he has to know and doesnt make mental mistakes
3118351 hmmm he looks like hes sleeping that must mean hes concentrating extra hard
3118352 some folks call it a sling blade i call it a kaiser blade mmm hmm
3118353 peyton manning is a thinker out there i can tell you that
3118354 tom brady is a champion i can tell you that
3118355 im so tired of doing interviews and talking about this or talking about that tomorrow hopefully the mad rush is over
3118356 im so tired of doing these interviews let me just sneak out of here and leak to greta van susteren chris mortensen reuters chelsea handler the editors at us weekly the dc press corps and matt drudge how sick i am of doing them

3118365 a federal program is still necessary over the next five years to ensure the end of life management of federal government it equipment as there is no guarantee as to when all provinces and the territories will have take back programs in place
3118366 they may be in a situation where they want a broad range of electronics to be recycled right off the bat whereas the provincial programs are ramping up kind of getting their feet under them first
3118367 there is currently no comprehensive strategy to address electronic waste in federal government operations
3118368 i thought i would be able to prove my innocence and receive justice which is why i returned to thailand on feb 28 but the situation has deteriorated
3118369 i have also constantly received news that my life is not safe wherever i travel i have to use bulletproof cars this is the result i got from having volunteered to serve the country the king and the people

3118371 such remarks by the former leader could damage the countrys image in its suggestion that we have an unjust judicial system

3118376 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
3118377 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3118378 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3118379 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
3118380 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
3118381 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
3118382 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3118383 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3118384 ive asked city officials to provide me with an analysis and recommendations on what the city of toronto can do through our zoning power in order to ensure that neighbourhoods are safe and remain safe when businesses such as this operate within the boundaries of the city

3118390 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3118391 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3118392 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3118393 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3118394 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3118395 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3118396 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3118397 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3118398 if everything goes well i think in a couple days

3118408 this procedure marks the culmination of 15 years of advances that have made surgery less invasive in order to improve safety and reduce recovery time
3118409 internal incisions such as in the uterus are less painful and may allow for quicker recovery than incisions in the abdominal wall
3118410 our study documented that hrt might be considered a useful tool to identify heart failure patients at high risk of death including high risk of dying suddenly
3118411 hrt may help physicians more effectively manage heart failure patients by indicating the need for more frequent follow up visits at specialized heart failure units and more intensely applied therapy including icd implantation in high risk patients
3118412 the cognitive impairment during the biological night was twice as large as during the normal time of awakening the biological morning
3118413 this is especially important considering that already following awakening during the morning the cognitive impairment can be more detrimental than staying awake all night and has been shown to be comparable to the effects of alcoholic intoxication
3118414 due to damage from chronic stomach acid they are people who have a higher risk of developing esophagus cancer the goal of this therapy is to literally freeze the damage in its tracks and stop it before it turns to cancer
3118415 this is a disease we see in a lot of older patients with other illnesses so the decision to send them to surgery requires careful consideration cryoablation therapy is particularly attractive for older patients who may have complications or other medical issues such as accompanying heart or lung diseases that make traditional surgeries for barretts with dysplasia too risky
3118416 this study is significant because previous findings have been contradictory and the present investigation includes the largest number of heart attacks in an elderly group to date
3118417 our findings make a persuasive case that adiponectin is in fact associated with an increase in risk in older persons
3118418 this study shows that this abundant product of fat cells is a marker and perhaps even a mediator of worsened outcomes in persons aged 65 years and older
3118419 as we age what we need to do to stay healthy begins to change these new easy to read checklists help americans age 50 and older realize the important steps they can take to stay healthy
3118420 equipping people with the tools and information to stay healthy is important for healthy aging we are eager to promote the use of these checklists through aging network community based partners that reach more than 10 4 million older people and their caregivers and deliver evidence based health promotion and disease prevention programs
3118421 obese men are more likely to be diagnosed with an aggressive form of the disease
3118422 our assumption is that these men have more blood volume so psa gets diluted he said
3118423 by the time obese men get to elevated levels the cancer is more advanced
3118424 im not sure that we should check obese men more often
3118425 but we should have a higher psa index of suspicion of what is not normal 3 4 rather than 4 for really obese men 3 2
3118426 the prostate is a narrow thing to operate on and when there is a big wad of fat in your way if the abdominal wall is thick it becomes a technical issue
3118427 the only thing we can think of is that when you operate on obese people you have to be more careful
3118428 we cant forget that when we use the term we are not just talking about very large men
3118429 a man who is 5 foot 9 and weighs 203 pounds would be considered obese
3118430 we are not screening these obese men effectively and are not doing as good a job surgically as could be done
3118431 breast feeding is associated with resilience against the psychosocial stress linked with parental divorce separation
3118432 theres a lot less verbal communication but lots of tactile communication and eye contact that promotes positive physiological responses
3118433 breastfeeding does seem to suppress stress responses in babies and it does seem that theres a protective effect
3118434 in terms of the biological possibility breast milk is pretty amazing stuff and the tactile interaction that goes along with breastfeeding does have an influence on the development of neurons
3118435 for most mothers breastfeeding doesnt come naturally if the baby doesnt latch on it can lead to feelings of failure and concern about whether or not the baby is getting enough milk women need lots of encouragement and education
3118436 breastfeeding is something for mothers and babies to enjoy a time for them to cherish and nurture each other
3118437 it is a carefully done study that strongly confirms the relationship between salt and hypertension high blood pressure
3118438 the power of this study is that it includes a very large cohort
3118439 the study clearly showed that people who had elevated salt intake were the ones who had high blood pressure that was independent of the genotype for this specific gene
3118440 it is clear that this is the tip of the iceberg
3118441 the hypothesis they tested was reasonable but they only tested one gene
3118442 the vast majority of the people we know who have high blood pressure do not carry a gene that we know of
3118443 you cant worry about your genotype because you cant do anything about it
3118444 this study reaffirms that salt intake has a significant effect on blood pressure and that is clearly something that you can control
3118445 we will continue to investigate to see what is happening at the plant to see what they have to do to get a handle on their food safety issues
3118446 theres a lot of misinformation so thats why this study is so important hundreds and hundreds of parents think changing diet works but we need serious evidence
3118447 none of the treatments studied had any significant benefit over no treatment at all
3118448 the booster can be given if it has been at least four weeks after the first dose
3118449 a week or two before maybe two weeks gradually move them over from a summer schedule to a school schedule
3118450 if we leave you alone well be dragging you out of bed
3118451 youre fighting human nature here by making some of these kids get up early
3118452 it really means some very strict control of the environment
3118453 work with the school board to change the start times
3118454 that time will come one day youll see when we can all be friends
3118455 everybody has a right to pronounce foreign names as he chooses
3118456 because there is substantial evidence that breast milk provides long term protective health benefits
3118457 this finding led us to hypothesize that early exposure to the high cholesterol content of breast milk could affect long term cholesterol metabolism
3118458 quality needs to be put into magazines today otherwise there will be no reason for magazines to exist
3118459 the guitar hero wunderkind whose astronomical scores and youtube videos of his gaming exploits are to these fans as thrilling as actually playing the game
3118460 in mice pre treated with the sirna cocktail and then infected with hiv we could not find any signs of virus for a long period of time
3118461 and when we treated mice whose immune systems had been reconstituted with t cells from an hiv infected individuals they were totally able to block expansion of the virus
3118462 you get a mouse with the immune system of a human
3118463 it would give me much more information on the effectiveness and toxicity of treatments and save time in human clinical trials
3118464 this sirna is a very interesting molecule that is actually programming cells to deal with the virus
3118465 in the approach with the stem cell gene therapy approach we are programming blood forming stem cells with anti hiv sirna so that the stem cells are viable lifelong in the individual
3118466 the virus resisting cells are produced on a daily basis
3118467 these approaches could be used to purge the latently infected cells
3118468 the advantage of sirna is that you can deliver it into resting t cells
3118469 so if these sirna are present when the cell becomes activated and starts to produce hiv you have sirna there ready to combat it
3118470 the cigarette companies have told us for years that smoking is an individual choice
3118471 but it is increasingly clear that for some people that isnt really the case
3118472 people with this genetic makeup find smoking pleasurable from that first cigarette and they are more likely to get addicted and develop
3118473 nicotine doesnt give you the euphoric high that drugs like morphine give
3118474 in fact during initial exposure many people get sick but while we understand quite a bit about how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after dependence is established we know very little about this initial vulnerability
3118475 if humans have naturally occurring differences in the dopamine system in this area of the brain that might be one reason why some people would find their initial exposure to cigarettes rewarding and others would get sick
3118476 confirms that soy foods lower total cholesterol even though the drop in ldl cholesterol wasnt significant
3118477 i dont think youd find people to study that had extremely high cholesterol levels that were going to be treated just with soy because its not consistent with current guidelines
3118478 if you use a soy burger or a soy frankfurter to displace a hamburger or frankfurter you would likely see a drop in ldl cholesterol because youre decreasing saturated fat
3118479 from that perspective using soy containing foods to displace foods with animal fat is probably advantageous
3118480 i think whenever there is a claim that a food is going to do something positive like lower cholesterol we all become very enthusiastic and it usually gets embraced without too much hesitation
3118481 however when data starts emerging that perhaps the original assessment was not accurate the bar is much higher as far as whats necessary to establish lack of effect as opposed to an effect
3118482 a hospital reimbursement rate reduction of 7 plus an assessment on hospital revenues would seriously disrupt health care services for all new yorkers and push some hospitals to the brink of closure
3118483 is there a counter plan to reduce hospitals cost of doing business by 7 it is unacceptable that hospitals and nursing homes are being asked to shoulder a vastly disproportionate share of proposed funding cut especially considering the enormous sacrifices hospitals have already made as a result of the berger commission which is in the final stages of closing and consolidating hospital services
3118484 we are deeply concerned that half of the total 1 billion in proposed cuts would be to vital healthcare funding at a time when our healthcare system is at a crossroads with hospitals struggling to stay financially solvent and communities weathering the closure of local facilities protecting healthcare funding is crucial these types of cuts would seriously compromise quality care for the patients we serve i strongly encourage the legislature and governor to look instead for revenue options including a surcharge on the wealthiest new yorkers in order to protect hospitals nursing homes and home care services
3118485 have been postulated to play a very important role in neurocommunication but in this field essentially no critical studies have been performed to address this issue
3118486 so i set up an experiment to create an animal model in which a particular group of neurons in the brain couldnt release a small neurotransmitter and by examining those animal models i could know the function of those molecules
3118487 we found that the mice without gaba release from agrp neurons have increased energy expenditure and are resistant to diet induced obesity
3118488 the function of agrp neurons is probably to reserve the energy for maintaining life
3118489 so if the animal doesnt have enough food the animal should have some strategy to preserve energy and this group of neurons by releasing gaba restrains energy expenditure to maintain enough energy to survive under the conditions in which food is not readily available
3118490 i think it makes the role of gaba in obesity much more relevant than previously thought
3118491 the u s is tremendously inefficient and china is worse
3118492 hi guys ive got another problem could one of you pop up and take a look please
3118493 well have to take it in for repair its a well known problem a new virus called desktop paralysis it might take a day or two to fix
3118494 as the partys field operation for udall markey and all other federal races except for the presidential one
3118495 i mean theyre booing all of us so yeah i take it personally
3118496 but like i said its not the first time and it wont be the last time
3118497 theres some things that the production wasnt there whether it was on the front end or the back end of the pass play
3118498 its kind of a personal matter and im going to keep that personal rodgers said

3118500 he needs to practice obviously with the time he has missed with his contract and now with his injury mccarthy said
3118501 were definitely going to have a problem there mccarthy said of the defensive injuries
3118502 i dont consider any of them major were just running into our fatigue injuries which most teams run into at this point
3118503 this is the toughest decision any prosecutor has to make

3118511 i think we have the makings of a super subprime crisis dealing with the federal governments finances and we need to defuse it
3118512 recognizes that the u s government will not achieve and maintain fiscal balance until we address the long run spending in these two programs
3118513 the fiscal situation is serious in the short run what we need to do is stop digging the hole any deeper
3118514 so what you need to do is put in place a set of ideas that would slow the growth of health spending economy wide
3118515 it is a very specific proposal that would polarize the debate
3118516 medicare reforms can have a dramatic impact on the practice of medicine
3118517 but were also going to have to recognize that the regular order the regular way of doing business in washington is broken
3118518 leadership is only going to come from somebody using the bully pulpit to create a mandate so this is the opportunity for leadership
3118519 otherwise a crisis is what it will take and thats a real problem because wall street is short term focused
3118520 the financial markets will make us deal with it but it will be too late when they do
3118521 survey for 2008 the annual listing of more than 1 400 schools is available online at www usnews com
3118522 although its hard to see us leave the top tier ranking in our previous category we are excited that this re categorization means our doctoral program is growing and thriving
3118523 the re classification now puts us in the same category as this nations finest educational institutions and were proud to be associated with the best were also proud to be able to offer a distinctive close and personal education within the context of a national university

3118525 some developers however have run afoul of apples limits on software it will distribute through the app store the company recently removed an application called i am rich that did nothing but display a glowing red gem for the eye popping sum of 999 99 the programmer who created it armin heinrich says he thought he was abiding by apples rules for its developers an apple spokeswoman said apple made a judgment call to remove i am rich apple raised hackles in computer privacy and security circles when an independent engineer discovered code inside the iphone that suggested iphones routinely check an apple web site that could in theory trigger the removal of the undesirable software from the devices mr jobs confirmed such a capability exists but argued that apple needs it in case it inadvertently allows a malicious program one that stole users personal data for example to be distributed to iphones through the app store hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull he says
3118526 i cant seem to make money online what am i doing wrong
3118527 where do i position my subject left right or in the middle
3118528 im standing out here because its one of our boys its a hometown response
3118529 were thankful for them for their sacrifice were all deeply touched by losing one of our own
3118530 we were doing our work here he was doing our work there
3118531 weve lost something very dear to us in this county
3118532 the fact that one of our has given the ultimate sacrifice its very tangible and very real
3118533 i had it hanging on my house so i took it down and brought it with me
3118534 when i knew it was him it just took my breath away
3118535 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3118536 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3118537 we are trying to be more efficient which means not do consultations that result in a difference for the species
3118538 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3118539 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3118540 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3118541 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3118542 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3118543 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3118544 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3118545 i think its huge said greg cecil chairman of the columbia airport advisory board
3118546 this is the biggest thing to happen at the airport in a long time because mesaba is going to get us to a hub which we havent been able to get to in a while
3118547 ive noticed the city has stepped up its efforts to do things at the airport and i think its important
3118548 its important to all the activities that the chamber has been involved with and all the new emphasis on regionalism this is all part of that and i think air service into this area will strengthen those efforts because it gives us some autonomy in terms of our ability to get people directly into the mid missouri region
3118549 we want to give the airport more of a regional focus
3118550 basically that was just a coincidental incident unrelated to this
3118551 i could not begin to speculate why other media outlets termed this a murder and strangulation
3118552 i am the public information officer and as far as i know there has never been any mention of that to any news media by the mid missouri major case squad centralia police or missouri state highway patrol
3118553 our raid boss the honorguard in kyllikkis crypt didnt respawn and i sent a petition to have a gm reset it we waited the full week so there was some sort of problem
3118554 while he was there i joked around and told him to take off his pants and of course he did
3118555 well it was 3am theres no pvp in the game and we couldnt do any more pve
3118556 at first i said a few of the in game moves in a sexual way and he took it to the next level
3118557 after that i wanted to see how far it could go and ultimately answer the burning question ive always had while playing
3118558 he still insisted i was a woman because i used the word hun
3118559 he asked me if hong a player i joked around stating he was a gold farmer was actually a gold farmer i assured him hong was not a gold farmer and he said something along the lines of good i was about to permaban him lol apparently the whole ive been f cking with you the entire time and the fact hong is in my guild just didnt get through to him
3118560 i told him at a later time id post these screenshots unless he gave me 100 in game gold of course within 24 hours it was there
3118561 i truly wish i had taken a screenshot of that bit
3118562 i sent some of the conversation to friends and they leaked it out
3118563 i was going to post the evidence regardless of whether those screenshots were leaked
3118564 im mostly worried about him hunting me down and killing me
3118565 aside from that though i thought it was hilarious he was fired i know if i pulled that crap on the job id expect to be fired too then again im not that dense to cyber with random customers
3118566 i play my toon fastolf on andorhal in wow nowadays anyways where i still try to rp with gms on there
3118567 oh just for a last confirmation you sure you wont take off your pants for me
3118568 i think that more than likely as we see the effects of uncontrolled blood pressure and uncontrolled diabetes continue to rise it can lead to a lot of long term problems like strokes
3118569 the costs related to someone after theyve had a severe stroke are extensive
3118570 it affects not only the economic situation of the family but the family itself
3118571 people live in the suburbs places where we have to drive to accomplish things so we are not walking to places
3118572 in south carolina it has to do a lot with the southern diet which revolves around high calories fried foods cooking with fat and eating large amounts of food
3118573 the heat discourages a lot of outdoor activity in the summer time and forces people indoors
3118574 do not fear carolyn i am a shield to you your reward shall be very great
3118575 pentagon oks over 10 billion in arms sales for iraq
3118576 two thirds of the raw sewage produced in the capital flows untreated into rivers and waterway
3118577 pictures of ronald reagan you can debate whether ronald reagan was good or bad but the point is everything he said he stood for is being put to the sword by george bush but i wont even have that debate with you george bush is a puppet i refuse to live in this false reality with you the country is dying weve been de industrialized weve been strip mined politically economically and spiritually
3118578 i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogue of satan
3118579 how can you instil democracy when your political position is that of indiscriminate warfare
3118580 admiral mullen us will stand by israel for next 1 000 years
3118581 heaven wont take marines and hell is afraid theyll take over
3118582 this isnt golf we dont get a do over we cant let this president wage war and kill more people in violation of international law and violation of the geneva convention his conduct is in violation of the nuremberg principles we need to hold him to account and if we do that there wont be an attack on iran
3118583 laura and i are having the time of our lives its going to be a perfect day im in a great mood
3118584 i will not go away i will not turn off the camera we are in public are you worried perhaps about the criminal liability of being a partner to mass murder after the fact you know that is a real concern because the truth is coming out
3118585 they will see every piece of evidence that goes to the finder of fact whether classified or not i want to make that very clear
3118586 taliban fighters are guilty of nothing but standing in defense of the innocent victims of 911
3118587 the taliban may have been a lot of things but they werent corrupt
3118588 as nazi tanks crossed into poland in 1939 an american senator declared lord if only i could have talked to hitler all of this might have been avoided we have an obligation to call this what it is the false comfort of appeasement which has been repeatedly discredited by history
3118589 this document does not purport to provide a prosecutable case against usama bin laden in a court of law
3118590 and at this juncture we are able to perform professional no notice inspections all over iraq and to increase aerial surveillance
3118591 as indie music zealots we love sites like pitchfork stereogum and brooklyn vegan
3118592 what was amazing to me is that you have a few hundred sites that cater to tastemakers within the music scene but no one is doing this for books and literature contrary to popular beliefs people are still reading books and we intend to share our favorite titles with them and highlight amazing books in the marketplace
3118593 the band has always put an effort into making the audience feel like an extension of arnocorps and to participate and rock out with us on stage
3118594 you cant interact with a movie but you can interact with arnocorps
3118595 a fee waiver given arbitrarily to non religious organizations by school administrators under the guise of enforcing a vague policy is a violation of a religious organizations first amendment rights
3118596 they never kicked they never struggled not a mark on the ground like they just fell right down killed them instantly
3118597 i dont know thats the first time it ever happened and i hope it never happens again
3118598 if everything goes well i think in a couple days
3118599 i feel like ive been making good progress every day taking a good step forward each time
3118600 it was scary but we needed a new level of sophistication to serve larger customers in order to grow
3118601 its tough to make all the investment on the front end
3118602 but when you need to grow sometimes you cant do it piecemeal
3118603 the only people you talk to at this stage are customers and potential customers
3118604 bankers cant measure competence or character if they dont know you
3118605 the first day an employee walks into the organization this should be part of their indoctrination
3118606 thats a big switch from early stage companies where it was about laser single minded focus
3118607 all of you recognize the issues before us are monumental were as frustrated as you are
3118608 welfare of a child is a compelling state interest that a state has not only a right but a duty to protect
3118609 as against the state this parental duty and right is subject to limitation only if it appears that parental decisions will jeopardize the health or safety of the child or have a potential for significant social burdens
3118610 it is the natural fundamental right of parents and legal guardians to determine and direct the care teaching and education of their children
3118611 somebody asked me one time what my sexual fantasy would be and under the guise of sounding crazy i said it would be having sex in a car but that seemed kind of conservative to me afterwards
3118612 i can assure you ive seen daytons application and they certainly were worthy of funding
3118613 our passion for the natural open spaces along with our childhood memories of the peninsula has motivated us to formally organize and capture the beauty of the remaining undeveloped land through our art as a record for future generations
3118614 this show is a one of a kind success every time its not a compilation of individual marketable works in a slick package its an experience that profoundly changes the viewer a place where one can go and get lost in the beauty of mans perception of nature i have seen the show for the last several years and by the time i leave my mind is always clear and calm i know i have just encountered a pure artistic experience although the majority of painters usually pass up the opportunity to show outside of a gallery steve mirich and the rest of this group have proven that with a lot of hard work and talent the artistic spirit can survive and even flourish in an alternative venue
3118615 painting in these areas and learning about the history of the rochester area that ive been living in for five years has really been eye opening
3118616 some information i already knew such as that rochester earned the name of
3118617 the venue for the exhibition and other educational programs could not be more appropriate for the theme of the show
3118618 with costumed men woman and children carrying out the work and play of 19th century work daily history truly lives and breathes at the genesee country village amp museum
3118619 in doing the research necessary to partake in this event i have gained a greater appreciation for the rich history in the area that i live
3118620 becoming familiar with the work of plein air painters of the past gives me a sense of continuity that i enjoy and it also gives me a starting point from which to build
3118621 seeing photographs of these 19th century artists painting huge canvases on flimsy easels in the middle of nowhere really makes me appreciate the commodities available to contemporary artists such as quick transportation and access to mass produced supplies its impressive to think of what those painters accomplished considering the difficulties they faced
3118622 ive participated in plein air easton for the last three years and of all the plein air events i attend this is one of the best
3118623 the event is highly organized and you get the opportunity to meet and learn from some of the best plein air painters in the country also there are so many enthusiastic collectors at plein air easton and they are genuinely interested in meeting the artists and purchasing paintings
3118624 the first year i participated in plein air easton in 2005 i was lucky enough to win the quick draw event and best architectural painting
3118625 it ended up being a great way to increase awareness of my work on both a regional and national level and i also ended up selling several paintings and finding a good gallery in easton i participated again in 2007 and i now have two pieces in the academy art museums permanent collection its just been a great experience overall and has become one of my favorite events
3118626 a successful plein air event is built on several components
3118627 these include substantial prizes sought after artists from across the country exhibition space in an accredited museum a backbone of local art galleries and strong community support plein air easton has all of these which has contributed to its great success
3118628 get the best images you have of your landscape work and send them in
3118629 and dont be disappointed if youre not selected remember it is only the opinion of one person judging the images and maybe the juror the following year will better resonate with your work
3118630 the location is beautiful there are a variety of landscapes harbor scenes cityscapes and the people are all so down to earth and helpful its an experience to be remembered
3118631 being around her and all her art supplies made so much possible i was always drawing
3118632 it started so early for me i really liked what my sister was doing and i wanted to do the same thing
3118633 i had painting and drawing instructors who encouraged us not to get hooked on anatomy and have that be all that we see
3118634 my instructor dan gheno often says the challenge is to draw the individual to get who they are into the picture
3118635 sometimes i grab a part of their likeness but it doesnt totally look like the person yet i got the feeling of that person which i think makes up for it the more you paint the easier capturing the essence comes of course you cant just say ok im going to get the essence now i may get pretty far along and still be searching still be in the search mode on a painting and then it comes
3118636 but then a few months of working outside of the art world became a few years then a few years became several years until i said enough of this
3118637 i realized i was good at what i do and i decided to return to the art scene
3118638 harvey was very encouraging and i began attending his classes again
3118639 i had been fascinated with pastel since high school but i hadnt had the chance to work with it because i was so involved with oil
3118640 but i liked and was impressed with what my classmates were doing with pastel then i learned from harvey how to use pastels at the league its such a fascinating medium theres no handle no brush nothing between the color and your fingertips its like an extension of your hand and i love the vibrancy of the color
3118641 i tear the labels off and just paint what i see
3118642 its so difficult these days to be a working artist in the city
3118643 its hard to make a living and have the time and money to maintain your art skills in new york i know a lot of friends who are very good painters but they had to give up art because they started a family and had to more consistently make money they had to stop painting
3118644 i have been fortunate to keep going all these years
3118645 its a tough situation the cost of living is a lot higher here than it used to be but i feel like there is always a way
3118646 this one here i just sold and its going to pay the rent this month
3118647 i have a responsibility to put forth my best efforts and i remind myself there is always more to learn
3118648 ive been blessed to study with some outstanding artists and to have the opportunity to share what ive learned with others
3118649 i was fortunate that the fredericksburg artists school was within a reasonable driving distance from my home in georgetown texas
3118650 i was able to study with some outstanding nationally known artists such as bob rohm lorenzo chavez and matt smith later i won a scholarship to study at the scottsdale artists school where i participated in workshops with ned mueller and t allen lawson
3118651 i love painting the landscape in a lot of different parts of the country colorado maine new mexico and utah but my favorite place to paint is the area of texas where i live
3118652 i am drawn to the quiet side of the landscape and gravitate to more tonal or intimate scenes in all location but i love the subtle grayed tones found in the texas landscape
3118653 i usually do several quick compositional sketches in graphite or charcoal to figure out what i want to include in the scene where to place the horizon line and how i will arrange the values and then i select the sketch that seems to offer the best plan
3118654 along with these small thumbnail sketches i include my thoughts on the scene what the weather is like how im feeling at the time the overall effect of the light these written notes help clarify my vision for the painting and play an important role later in the studio then i try to capture my first impression of the location the center of interest and overall composition that best captures my feeling about being at a particular location in a quick reference study on small surfaces ranging from 6
3118655 i dont necessarily work from hard pastels to soft on every painting i do
3118656 sometimes if the value and color is right but the stick happens to be a very soft pastel i will apply it early on in a work but i will use a very light touch so as not to fill the tooth of the paper too quickly
3118657 i like to drag a bristle brush through areas of my work to indicate more texture or use the side of my little finger to soften an edge or blend a portion of the sky
3118658 i took a workshop with john pototschnik in 2007 and he really helped me with selecting and mixing colors
3118659 he worked with several different palettes of colors and always achieved the kind of clarity and clean color i wanted in my own work
3118660 i also took a 10 day workshop in maine with t allen lawson and he helped me understand the usefulness of working in different value ranges high key low contrast and the like
3118661 tim is so articulate and he challenges students to consider new approaches to content design and color ive remained in touch with him and he is very generous in looking at my new paintings and offering suggestions
3118662 theres nothing wrong with working on standard size pieces of paper or canvases but sometimes its worth considering whether a landscape might be more interesting as a vertical rather than a horizontal or if it were painted within a square or an elongated format
3118663 you can then apply what youve discovered by observing nature and use the photos as more of a jumping off point in creating a work and not slavishly copy them
3118664 i really enjoy painting outdoors in the company of other artists and ive joined a couple of plein air painting groups and hooked up with friends who share my enthusiasm for outdoor painting
3118665 i dont mind working by myself but i like sharing the experience with other artists and getting their comments about my work thats why i joined a group that meets once a month for fellowship an exchange of information and ideas and critiques of one anothers latest work
3118666 im attracted to the physical appearance of bold strokes of juicy oil color
3118667 and as my skills and confidence level increase i will exhibit more of them
3118668 it was just beyond imaginable words cant express how i felt playing out there it was just a great way to kick off the olympics for me for my teammates to get a win the way they did
3118669 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
3118670 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished
3118671 when i first came here to live i thought i would be here my whole life and it was my goal to understand how farm life worked the seasons changing bad and good weather wildlife coming and going and how all this affected the sowing and reaping of the harvest
3118672 being a painter i always saw the beauty in farm life the land was so rich black clay in spots with gently rolling hills and a few pecan trees and willows in the low places there were also about four or five ponds teeming with bass and catfish for watering the livestock it
3118673 with the many busy roads and houses being built so close and with austins county dump sprawling to within a mile of our property the decision was out of our hands
3118674 im a student of kevin macpherson and i worked with him while he was in the middle of his pond series
3118675 he and my mentor ray vinella always told me to paint what you know and paint it often i had painted a few farm scenes but when i learned we were selling the farm i felt compelled to paint it every possible moment i became so inspired by every aspect of the land the morning dawning in a different light every day the seasons changing the sound of wildlife and birds moving in and out the moonrises suddenly my sadness over selling the farm turned to gratitude i was so grateful for gods handiwork all around me and for the natural beauty that i could capture on canvas
3118676 often i would just paint one canvas after another as the light or my mood changed
3118677 one day in the fall i painted 24 paintings in 24 hours i enjoyed the experience and results so much that i decided to do it again in the winter early spring late spring and summer then in april i did 24 paintings in 24 hours for my last day on the farm
3118678 for so many months i had painted and hoarded the canvases stacking them up in boxes and then when i finally saw them all exhibited together i just started to cry it became so clear to me that each painting represented a distinct moment in time when i look at those paintings now i see a memory of the day i remember the weather the time the particular birds that flew by or the bug that i rescued from my cadmium yellow these last moments on the farm are now captured forever
3118679 a landscape artist has something to say about beautiful places we try to convey more than a photograph and move the viewer to consider the beauty of our creation
3118680 but painters arent the only ones with creative ideas commercial developers are creative in their own right and perhaps artists can inspire them to approach their projects in such a way so as to not only conserve existing beauty but also create future beauty
3118681 after leaving the farm we moved to a rural neighborhood near the local high school
3118682 im trying to see the positive and appreciate the beauty of where we live now but there are days when i look out the window and miss being able to see for miles around the farm the sweeping skies the open views
3118683 alexandria is one of the oldest settlements and colonial seaports on the east coast
3118684 it has more than 4 200 historic 18th and 19th century buildings as well as numerous contemporary shops restaurants and galleries painters can walk cobblestone pathways depict the lively street scenes or paint the historic buildings and monuments of washington dc from across the potomac
3118685 we always have a great turnout and the artists who participate are highly motivated
3118686 old town is quite beautiful and historic and its a natural environment to integrate a photographic and learning experience i usually end up having as much fun as the participants
3118687 paint alexandria is a wonderful event that allows artists to exercise their interest and ability in plein air painting
3118688 i demonstrate right on the waterfront the weather is usually gorgeous and it is incredibly invigorating to be surrounded by people with such eager and inquisitive minds
3118689 i think its important for those attending to see how a plein air painting is constructed
3118690 when you watch someone paint on site you learn what is required to accurately capture a particular moment of the day before the light and conditions change
3118691 i try to pack a lot of information into my demonstrations and i speak a lot about color and developing harmonious color relationships
3118692 i like to answer questions so participants usually find a notebook handy for writing down information a camera is useful too for documenting the process in stages
3118693 with the exciting additions and changes happening throughout the old town area were looking forward to the best paint alexandria yet
3118694 your watching that im pretty sure i just heard your iq drop

3118697 se per il gas prendiamo lipotesi piu ottimistica del 6 spiega il presidente di federconsumatori rosario trefiletti siamo intorno a un aumento di 66 euro lanno per la luce sarebbe invece di circa 19 euro
3118698 al di la di ogni pessimistica previsione e se aggiunti agli aumenti che si sono gia verificati dal primo di gennaio per gas e luce comportano rincari di oltre 250 euro allanno
3118699 da un lato realizzare le tariffe agevolate di gas e luce per le famiglie meno abbienti dallaltro lato bloccare il carico fiscale e parificare liva sul gas al 10
3118700 what we need from the north koreans is a strong verification regime thats our policy and it still stands
3118701 the important point is they havent produced for us that verification regime that we need to go forward on that issue
3118702 i asked her as details on the verification have yet to be decided can i take it that the delisting wont happen today and she said yes you can take it that way
3118703 what we need from the north koreans is a strong verification regime thats our policy and it still stands
3118704 non so se ci sar un testo pronto per quando il consiglio si riunir questo pomeriggio
3118705 ik weet dat een vraagteken niet is toegestaan als god ergens een punt achter zet dus ik zal niet klagen over de beslissing van god om hem bij zich te roepen
3118706 hij was een echte heer en een erg warme en getalenteerde artiest die ik respecteerde en bewonderde
3118707 hij was ook een blijvend symbool van de strijd van de afro amerikanen hij was een voorbeeld van soul op zijn best
3118708 jezus werd opgedragen om het huis van isra l te bewaken terwijl zijn meester zelf door het dorp ging om kleren te verzamelen die geverfd moesten worden maar zodra isra l het huis had verlaten ging jezus er vandoor om met zijn vriendjes te spelen
3118709 jezus nam zijn vrienden mee naar de waterkant en liep met bal en knuppel het water op alsof het een bevroren oppervlak was zijn vrienden riepen kijk het kind jezus wat hij doet op de golven van de zee en velen kwamen daar samen en keken naar hem en waren verbaasd
3118710 maar dit verhaal wijst erop dat voor een balspel zelfs jezus zijn werk vergat om lol te hebben met zijn vrienden

3118725 john mccain s top foreign contract authority lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the function advocated by the government
3118726 sen mccain is understandably willing to state who he thinks is the assaulter here
3118727 i dont think you crapper excuse defend explain or make margin for slavonic activity because of what is going on in georgia

3118732 poor decisions by plaintiffs to go to trial are associated with cases in which contingency fee arrangements are common

3118764 based solely on their generalized knowledge that trademark infringement might be occurring on their web sites

3118840 successfully and safely carrying out its first ever nuclear test
3118841 militant assertion of national sovereignty and the right of an independent country to develop its own powerful self reliant defense capability amidst constant efforts by the us to impose its imperialist hegemony over the world maintain its monopoly of nuclear weapons along with a few other powerful countries and subvert the sovereign will of the dprk
3118842 with 100 of sheer indigenous wisdom and technology under secure conditions at a stirring time when all the people of the country are making a great leap forward in the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation
3118843 regard the dprk nuclear test as a significant positive development in the effort of freedom loving peoples the world over to challenge the us imposition of pax americana over the world break the us and other big imperialist powers monopoly over nuclear weapons and compel the worlds peoples to kneel before its hegemonic power
3118844 now in the face of the dprks advance in scientific and technical knowhow with nuclear power the us is significantly deterred from threatening and carrying out military strikes against the dprk the us is afraid that it can no longer try to bully the dprk
3118845 contrary to imperialist propaganda the strengthening of the nuclear capability of the dprk does not pose a threat to other nations sovereignty and to genuine world peace
3118846 in the past the dprk has shown respect for the independence of other countries in the same way that it wants the us to respect the sovereign will of the dprk
3118847 the development of nuclear capability in the hands of independent countries that persist in the fight against us hegemonism and aggression realistically deters the us from using its nuclear weapons and military might to attack these countries and is thus a positive factor in our common striving for genuine peace in the world
3118848 you are mildly intelligent you think you are extremely intelligent
3118849 oh its all right nobody not even the north koreans are crazy enough to use nuclear weapons so lets just ignore the fact that they have them and carry on business as usual
3118850 huh what did he or she really just say that
3118851 let it happen to others but not us it doesnt matter then
3118852 now in the face of the dprks advance in scientific and technical knowhow with nuclear power the us is significantly deterred from threatening and carrying out military strikes against the dprk the us is afraid that it can no longer try to bully the dprk
3118853 contrary to imperialist propaganda the strengthening of the nuclear capability of the dprk does not pose a threat to other nations sovereignty and to genuine world peace

3118855 the development of nuclear capability in the hands of independent countries that persist in the fight against us hegemonism and aggression realistically deters the us from using its nuclear weapons and military might to attack these countries and is thus a positive factor in our common striving for genuine peace in the world

3118858 oppressive or unjustly severe government on the part of any ruler
3118859 the sanctions being pushed by the us before the united nations security council demonstrate the sheer hypocrisy arrogance and double standards of the us the country with the worlds biggest nuclear stockpile has no moral ascendancy to demand that other countries be sanctioned for alleged possession of nuclear weapons
3118860 the nuclear testing in north korea must be understood within the historical context of hostile us north korea relations which involved the deaths of 4 million koreans in the 1950s crippling economic sanctions against the korean people for more than 56 years as well as continuing threats of attacks from the us
3118861 the nuclear test conducted by north korea is the result of years of us threats and sanctions against a country that refuses to tow us economic and political impositions others may criticize north korea for its internal policies but we cannot ignore the fact that north korea has strived to defend itself against us impositions and threats of attacks
3118862 the nuclear test is perhaps even a matter of survival for the ever threatened north korea this nuclear stand off would not have happened were it not for us aggression in north east asia therefore the us is in no position to push for sanctions that would only escalate tension in the region for a peaceful and diplomatic solution to happen the us must first back off
3118863 the us has around 6500 active nuclear warheads including intercontinental ballistic missiles as well 1 100 short range tactical nuclear devices the us is the only government in history which has launched two nuclear attacks
3118864 the nuclear test is perhaps even a matter of survival for the ever threatened north korea
3118865 you might as well go out and shoot everyone you see and then shoot yourself
3118866 whoever you are go about your life like you always have unless youve lived your life in fear from nuclear attack then you should probably change your approach its all rhetoric fear mongering propaganda and the like

3118871 americans during the second half of the 20th century they dont follow the same rules everyone and their grandmother knows that humanity has the capacity to destroy itself at the blink of an eye we are all following the same rules
3118872 if you fin americans would quit pissin off so many damn countries thinking you need to control everything and everyone then maybe people wouldnt be so determined to rid themselves of you when hitler started his campaign to control the world the world responded and put hitler in his place freedom reigned and always will

3118880 just 12 years ago 1 million people were killed in 100 days in rwanda during the worst genocide ever 3 000 people compared to that is like a drip in the ocean dont fall for the bush regimes scare tactics please ignorance is never good but being scared shitless of terrorists are insane in my opinion
3118881 closed off country run by someone who considers himself chosen to rule over his people by god
3118882 the goal of your average terrorist in the scheme of things is to punish nonbelievers and create a muslim world the people in control know that nuking an american city would essentially bring about the destruction of the middle east and therefore defeat their purpose
3118883 i think what cappy comment 18 said is sort of where i was coming from
3118884 the cold war was indeed different but at the same time religious fanatics and political doctrine fanatics are very similar people are willing to die for their country just as easily as they would be for their god if conditioned properly using what happened on 9 11 as an example to how the um terrorists would be willing to use nukes is only speculation obviously right but i think scale matters throughout the first 30 years of the cold war no one was saying that the us was dealing with an enemy that relied on logic and cared for their lives same fear if im wrong im wrong right
3118885 i guess i didnt word the article perfectly but oh well just so you know the point was that im not worried about any nuclear warfare its possible to say that every weapon throughout history that has been developed has been used and therefore one shouldnt think any differently when it comes to nuclear weapons but theyre different scale matters imo

3118929 the games should have sports that are clean and have the best athletes at the games in the case of baseball and had sic a universal appeal in the case of softball
3118930 just trying to enjoy 100 percent the experience and later try my best on court
3118931 i feel really good about the match not a lot of unforced errors no service breaks
3118932 i did the right things to come out on top
3118933 its a great thing going out there playing for your country
3118934 it was a lot i cant count but it was cool i guess
3118935 just trying to enjoy 100 percent the experience and later try my best on court
3118936 i feel really good about the match not a lot of unforced errors no service breaks
3118937 i did the right things to come out on top
3118938 its a great thing going out there playing for your country
3118939 it was a lot i cant count but it was cool i guess
3118940 at different things and try to fit them into the puzzle
3118941 today were expanding our investigation into the auction rate securities scandal to insure investors across new york state and the nation get their money back
3118942 we believe that when you protect the investor you also increase investor confidence which helps the entire market
3118943 i was very comfortable with my game there here it wasnt the case i wasnt happy with how i was swinging the club this week
3118944 the only thing i knew from experience is that in a major nobody goes without making mistakes
3118945 as long as i hung in there i knew i would get my opportunity
3118946 and the putts there was no question i was just fully focused on holing them
3118947 its nice when youve got to hole a putt that you see the line right away
3118948 it was an easy putt to read it was a double break i hit it a cup right of the hole
3118949 i knew the pace was about right i wanted to see it break i was just saying go on keep going keep going break it broke right left and got just inside the left half and dropped very nice

3118960 capra esque but with a modern and very contemporary spin on the fun and the comedy
3118961 the climate has changed in that theres very few slots for dramas or for the things that i wanted to do i didnt want to do another cop show though i would consider something if it were international in scope and global in nature
3118962 if it sounds too good to be true it is
3118963 its a huge compliment to be asked to do that and it was really amazing to be taken seriously but i have my work cut out for me
3118964 i didnt even really respond to the rumors because they were so silly
3118965 the rumors came from someone who knew how important the fashion line is to me and knew that saying that would hurt me
3118966 massachusetts health authorities are warning consumers not to eat ground beef bought from whole foods markets over the last two months after seven infections have been linked to meat bought there some after a national recall
3118967 we cant go outside today ari its hot and mommy cant wear a tank top because her arms look like oversized turkey wings
3118968 jason i dont want to go out to eat with you that would involve me wearing something besides elastic waist pants and you know i cant do that without the mushroom muffin top hybrid effect going on at full force plus youll get a salad or something and ill be too embarrassed to devour my entire heaping plate of chicken tenders and french fries in 9 seconds flat
3118969 i cant help you across the monkey bars bella because if i lift my arms too high my road mapped belly will be exposed and cause dry heaving amongst all the other park patrons
3118970 in 2004 i won the gold medal for myself today i won it for all my supporters and fans
3118971 winning the gold medal is more important than breaking the world record
3118972 i wanted to bring joy to the north korean people however i failed to do so so i am very sad and sorry
3118973 when i look out my window i can see all the way down the street now
3118974 i havent been able to do that in more than 30 years living here
3118975 we assess the condition inside and out we estimate the cost of rehab and we estimate the value of the home after rehab we are very critical and discerning
3118976 thats where the guy lived who killed the pizza guy a couple of years ago and that house there 2914 dupont one time they were outside with big guns but the city doesnt do anything until its too late until its reached a crisis point
3118977 im glad that it the home is gone for now
3118978 but in the long run i dont know if its such a good thing i have no idea what will end up over there if anything at all
3118979 its a good situation that you can ask that question
3118980 i have probably been the leading player in europe for close to six years it is a big step now to move up and start competing on a different level ive got phil ive got tiger ahead of me i dont necessarily pay attention to what theyre doing i pay attention to more what im doing
3118981 many periods in my career ive had lulls where ive been in between things and come out stronger
3118982 im looking at this period as one of those that i am coming out stronger with experience and im putting a lot more things together im making things happen on the golf course
3118983 its a long way to catch tiger at the top
3118984 but i know that the only way of focusing on doing that is focusing on me controlling what i can do thats the only thing i can ask of myself
3118985 i obviously hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
3118986 to believe that i achieved something they hadnt is very special
3118987 i dodged a bullet because there was some more high profile losers that day
3118988 but i walked away from that tournament knowing i could win a major and youve got to lose them to know you can win them ive got to put myself in the position and learn from it and understand it before i actually go and do it
3118989 they all bring something different to the table and the competition is only great for our team
3118990 its a committee with more than one person trying to win the starting spot
3118991 you would think with three guys going for one spot that there would be some guys that are a little bit self centered but all three help each other on and off the practice field
3118992 they get excited when the other one picks up a blitz they get excited when the other one makes a run thats what you want
3118993 to me its whatever i can do to help the team
3118994 i stopped eating mcdonalds and started eating salads it was difficult but it had to be done
3118995 it was good getting a feel for the game last season and getting adjusted to the speed of the game
3118996 one of them could have the hot hand on saturday and hes going to play more
3118997 thats just the way you are going to have to substitute them
3118998 we havent run a scrimmage yet the quarterbacks have done well but weve got a long way to go
3118999 i think were just going to see what happens naming a starter may not happen may not happen until three four games but right now i just stick trying to give each kid a shot
3119000 theres always got to be a couple guys that when one guy is hanging in there for dear life somebody kicks him in the pardon me ladies kicks him in the ass and says youre not tired you just think youre tired get your rear end moving
3119001 you need a guy in there that just took over the whole football team so i think you hard to develop that if you keep changing kids so ive never been a guy for two quarterbacks if i can help it
3119002 if i have to grab someone on their jersey and yank them aside and talk to them to their face you have to make this block you have to make this catch you have to run this ball to get this first down then thats what i have to do
3119003 i like to talk to people alone that way away from the group and i think you have to have that in a tight situation because as a quarterback you have to have it its not taught its an instinct you have to have you want to be a leader the center of attention in each and every game
3119004 i think id just tell the guys settle down its just a game
3119005 i just dont really speak out that much you can lead by example or more by voice and i think i lead more by example i let my actions do the talking
3119006 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
3119007 we are proud to have published two bestselling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
3119008 the prime minister was freed this afternoon along with three other government officials i understand that only the president is still being held
3119009 the six representatives firmly condemned the coup and said it was unacceptable to overthrow a democratically elected president and demanded that the president and his prime minister are set free and constitutional order is restored
3119010 i view it as a program failure when i see the young men say that they are prepared for the type of interviews and attention they get and dont understand the emotion and energy that comes with it
3119011 i feel like i can do a much better job as a head coach in our program of preparing these young men to help them with the transition from me to we
3119012 in general the expectations and the attention are providing a new level of tests for coaches players and our program and as the fans parents and even wives become more anxious for the upcoming season it makes it more critical the grounding effect that ive been saying from the beginning this is the same challenge but at the higher level
3119013 the intent was right for the most part and i was pleased with the team until the last team period
3119014 the concentration in catching just could have been improved overall though i thought it was a good day
3119015 it wasnt any different tempo than what we have done in no pads or half pads
3119016 well continue to escalate until our first scrimmage on saturday
3119017 some people feel had he not passed away it may have taken off he was such a powerful figure and a rallying point to the community it was a horrible shame who knows what couldve happened
3119018 cal polys in a bit of a unique situation with regard to gender equity
3119019 id say largely due to some of the unique majors we have here we havent had the female enrollment as much as male so our measuring stick is different than most its a very unusual situation
3119020 allowed things to get way out of whack and all of sudden needed a big fix
3119021 when budgets were robust they didnt make adjustments that couldve saved some sports
3119022 you can add cross country because youre talking about eight to 12 athletes
3119023 but thats not near the same expense of bringing in 100 athletes necessary for a football team its just a shame of waiting until budgets are tight and then having to dump it it ends up being a permanent solution for a temporary problem and thats really sad
3119024 every now and then you hear stuff but its shot down mainly because of financial reasons
3119025 it does seem to really be west coast oriented for whatever reason
3119026 but its just such an expensive sport even among the bcs schools not all of them make money on football
3119027 its just hard for us to do with our budget here
3119028 the question i get more than anything else is why did we drop football id say a lot of people miss it
3119029 you dont really have a choice as far as who you can play
3119030 its just the nature of the beast with the states budget crisis
3119031 at cal poly a lot of our students live right here and the community is right here
3119032 were kind of the only show so we benefit more than if youre in the l a area where people may identify with ucla or usc even if they didnt go there
3119033 i sense a little more indifference to football on the west coast
3119034 theres been a t shirt for sale in our bookstore that says cal tech football undefeated since 1993
3119035 thats kind of our tongue in cheek way of looking at things
3119036 in ohio pennsylvania or wisconsin if they talked about dropping football someone would probably die there just seems to be apathy here in california theres so much more to do its just different
3119037 in some students minds having a football program legitimizes their college experience and can make it feel like a usc or a ucla
3119038 a football program is a little unique in that theres a whole game day experience you dont necessarily have with other sports
3119039 the band does this the student section does that it certainly adds to student life and culture in some unique ways

3119050 im still waiting for grades on quarless timmons and bowman right now have been practicing with us as is quarless but he knows he has to get a certain grade and i wont get into that
3119051 i dont want to embarrass anybody anymore than i have to i dont really want to get into it now
3119052 the reasons that i dismissed both taylor and baker are reasons that the squad knows and i feel comfortable it was the right decision
3119053 now whether thats right or wrong i dont know you know its a very difficult trying to be fair is not exactly easy when youre playing god with somebodys life particularly at that age
3119054 its your brother its my best friend its hard to do but its a business everybodys got their own problems mines just one little problem
3119055 im trying to black that out right now get through camp and keep my starting spot its in the back of my head but i cant really show it when we cross that blue line
3119056 sean lee talked to me calmed me down and said hey just take it as a learning experience you cant help things that happen like that just sit back and watch practice and learn
3119057 i really liked the leadership and demeanor billy showed in the spring but he didnt take anything for granted at that point
3119058 he really took charge over the summer during our conditioning program and the players workouts that was where he earned the respect and confidence of his teammates
3119059 ive been waiting for this gold medal for eight years
3119060 this time on the stage has been a perfect ending to my career
3119061 i was gambling with the weight and my other opponents
3119062 i was conservative in some ways and all of my tactics were right
3119063 i got an injury to my thumb two weeks ago the doctor tried to fix it but failed
3119064 im happy that my teammate was able to win the silver medal
3119065 obviously nic grigsby taking a shot at one of our players was disturbing and well get that straightened out
3119066 but overall i was really pleased with the play of a lot of our players
3119067 some of our younger players were really exciting and special in a lot of different ways
3119068 hes quick real low to the ground he just runs really hard
3119069 was a horrible situation and you never want to see that
3119070 but it did create more opportunities for running backs and you have to take advantage of that situation
3119071 there were a couple things i could have done better but overall i think i performed well
3119072 we run the same style of offense that we ran in my high school so im feeling pretty comfortable in it
3119073 im trying to figure everything out right now get a few things corrected
3119074 i feel really good about the depth at our linebacker position we havent had that in a little while
3119075 marks never showed up when he was supposed to show up its just sometimes people have to make decisions in their lives and its a very difficult one to make when youre in the limelight as he is
3119076 i think josh had a tough time getting used to the conditioning and stuff
3119077 he was a little bit heavy he had a tough time adjusting to that
3119078 it was the roughest time of my life and i dont think ill ever go through that again
3119079 going to towson was the best thing i could have done for myself
3119080 i think they didnt really try to get both sides
3119081 i dont even know how to send a text message
3119082 ive never had a text message come to me i dont have a computer
3119083 i cant walk away from the fact that we had some kids that were wrong and that maybe i didnt do the best job i could have in the thing
3119084 it came out guys were a little upset by it but the fact of the matter remains that was over a year and a half ago guys faced the consequences they paid the penalties they did what they had to do and weve moved on from there
3119085 how many times can we rehash old stuff when are we going to drop it the fact that it keeps getting brought up can we move on can we talk about football
3119086 i dont know how we could make it any better then have these four teams come in
3119087 many of them have been playing each other in non conference situations now theyll play for real
3119088 any time you play for real it becomes a little more meaningful i think
3119089 its good for everyone in the conference that its going to be a tough draw
3119090 they havent had an opportunity to play those teams they dont know quite what to expect
3119091 before we were a four deep team conference now were going to be an eight team deep conference
3119092 i think its going to give us a lot of good credibility its going to give us the opportunity to get into the playoffs
3119093 there can be plenty of upsets on any weekend that can really screw with the polls
3119094 we know that when we get all our kids in and get a chance to practice and play and our hope is that with our senior leadership we can do well
3119095 as it goes with preseason polls with no disrespect to the media and spectators our thing is if you can stay healthy and make sure you can do a good job on offense and defense it gives you a chance to be successful
3119096 if you dont like broke ass stuart and his guidebook you and your frommers can go fuck yourselves at the ferry building

3119099 i feel truly blessed to have the opportunity to give back to a university and community that has given me so much over the years
3119100 it is really exciting for me to see family and all these supporters here
3119101 i am ready to now build on the tradition of husky basketball
3119102 sooner or later you have to go with your gut and we felt fish was the one
3119103 this is as good a coaching staff that we have ever had here at scsu
3119104 i think at this level the players will adapt quickly ulferts and i have a lot of similar philosophies
3119105 shes a great mentor and ive learned a lot form her and i hope to carry that with me as i continue to develop this program
3119106 the next step is getting to know the team and develop the relationships with them
3119107 i really feel theyve got great senior leadership with a core of young women that we can really build on
3119108 i couldnt really find a better situation to be in
3119109 i had a great experince in mankato but am ready to start a new chapter
3119110 they are all important and exciting so it wont be any different than any other game we play
3119111 we are going to play every team the same so there will not be that big of an adjustment
3119112 but now the fans will be able to follow us better and it will create new and exciting rivalries
3119113 i stay away from the tabloids i dont feel that i should personally have to defend myself to a magazine that im not a drug addict i dont do drugs i dont sell pictures of my friends
3119114 im not going to talk about lindsay because shes my friend you know shes great shes also 22 years old i think people forget that
3119115 with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up
3119116 even the airport security guy in canada asked me so is it true
3119117 i love the ronsons theyre close to my and i respect all the work they do samantha and my relationship is a private matter

3119148 the important point is they havent produced for us that verification regime that we need to go forward on that issue
3119149 i asked her as details on the verification have yet to be decided can i take it that the delisting wont happen today and she said yes you can take it that way
3119150 what we need from the north koreans is a strong verification regime that amp squo s our policy and it still stands

3119172 im in a four year relationship with my partner whom i love dearly but there is also my family who is on the other side pushing for marriage

3119184 ive been told by my muslim friends about how sinful homosexuality is but i never think its true
3119185 ninety nine percent of muslims feel that its wrong because the quoran says so
3119186 where in the quoran does it say that its okay to suck dick but wrong to eat pork
3119187 its just the usual bullshit you get from people trying to reconcile their homosexuality with spirituality

3119191 even if im leading an immoral life and sleeping with boys theres hope
3119192 but with this im giving god the finger it would hurt them that their son is going to hell
3119193 they dont want to give up their desires but they want to hold onto the security blanket of god

3119200 for ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women ye are indeed a people transgressing
3119201 im training to be an imam so i can provide a better service of how to live in this society
3119202 ive always challenged scholars because theyre heterosexual and thats why they interpreted it that way
3119203 if one considers it acceptable in islam to be gay then he or she is not considered to be a muslim by consensus of the scholars
3119204 im in a four year relationship with my partner whom i love dearly but there is also my family who is on the other side pushing for marriage
3119205 i feel like a rag doll in the middle of a tug of war and for all of you who are in the same boat you know what a difficult position this puts us in ive come to realize that i cannot be the only one in the world in this predicament so if you are a lesbian muslim in a similar situation id love to talk to you and maybe we could help each other out
3119206 the pressure builds because youre supposed to extend this family

3119230 if we can experience anothers mind in our own we know that love is possible
3119231 from similar premises weve reached similar conclusions thats not so surprising but something about this kind of resonance always leaves me in awe whenever it happens when a man writing four centuries ago seems to take the words out of your mouth its impossible not to be filled with a kind of spiritual wonder the outcome is solidarity between people but if im honest there is also imagining whether some transcendent thing binds us together

3119262 ive talked to my mum quite a bit and the phones ringing and theres a lot of media interest and of course its just my mum in christchurch shes not equipped to deal with something of this magnitude not that shes not capable its just that its so surreal that all of a sudden she gets drawn into this
3119263 we have a small family in new zealand but were tight i know shes hurting and shes very much a part of the broader picture
3119264 our two families were very close and it is a good in law relationship shes rocked its hard for all of us
3119265 volleyball is my job my family is my life so that distinction has been very easy for me
3119266 i am passionate about the game my job i enjoy coaching volleyball has been wonderful to elisabeth and i but at this stage its very easy for me to focus on the task at hand which is taking care of my immediate family
3119267 once weve got it taken care of we can look at other things in life but right now thats purely where my focus is
3119268 the one thing that has been incredible has been the huge groundswell of support to help us pick up the pieces and help us manage this difficult situation as best as we can he said
3119269 interest has been global but in no way have we exposed ourselves with dealing with our emails and our phonecalls or anything like that its just too overwhelming we appreciate that everyone is with us we are just in no capacity to deal with that right now

3119271 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence there is no indication her that there was an pre meditation it seems unfortunately to be a case of the wrong place at the wrong time certainly in our opinion that is the way it seems to be
3119272 it hurts its its something that no one should have to got through lifes not fair so its never going to be about that kind of stuff
3119273 at the end of the day it happened and it seems the the sooner we can come to grips with that and kind of process it the better off were going to be anger isnt an emotion im going to allow myself to indulge in
3119274 certainly the team has been influenced by this its not exactly how you would want to prepare for your first match having to deal with a tragedy of this nature
3119275 teachers with 20 30 kids in the classroom dont get time to teach these things the job of a teacher is a very hard job when youve got 30 little brains thinking in different ways at different rates and on top of that you have an increasing amount of paperwork to do
3119276 i believe some teachers go into survival mode and just pass out information to the kids and often it doesnt meet the way individual students learn best
3119277 it used to be that new zealanders perceived after school tuition as something that asian countries did but now in places like australia private tuition is the norm particularly for those who can afford it

3119315 i was considering giving up before belgrade and now i have to say im very doubtful about ever wanting to do eurovision again ive had so much fun but i think its time for someone else to take over
3119316 days before the show i knew russia would win the fact is putin was getting nasty which means the former satellite states were always going to vote for russia in order to keep the oil coming
3119317 its unfortunate i suppose but whereas we have always taken eurovision with a pinch of salt the former eastern bloc countries are not sufficiently versed in the ways of democracy to realise they are supposed to be voting for a song not a next door neighbour
3119318 the only way the uk will ever regain any respectability is if we get a major british star robbie williams take that god knows there are enough of them to represent us and then people will vote for us
3119319 i just want to thank everyone who came here this evening you are the ones supporting the laminitis fund and the barbaro foundation
3119320 i feel like ive said this so many times barbaro opened our hearts to what horses mean to us we never expected what happened to barbaro but are thankful for all the positive things he has brought
3119321 he ran so easily and showed up so proudly in the paddock and we found so much joy in that even after his injury and during the eight months he spent in a stall he kept his ears pricked always happy to have visitors but when the laminitis hit he became a different horse he let us know he was ready
3119322 through barbaros tragedy laminitis has been turned into a household word and that has helped us gain the means to move forward and better understand the disease and most importantly prevent it
3119323 to date the laminitis fund has raised approximately 1 5 million dollars
3119324 we have received letters from every state and 15 foreign countries barbaro has inspired more optimism and positive causes than we could have ever imagined
3119325 the russian invasion of georgia reminds us that we are living in a dangerous world challenged by threats not only from islamic fascism but by an authoritarian dictatorship in russia that seeks restoration of empire and domination over its neighbors
3119326 is another example during these uncertain times where we need experienced leadership we need somebody like senator mccain who will take a stronger view a more experienced view when it comes to international security and protecting americas interests
3119327 lobbied for and has a vested in interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the georgia government
3119328 today many are dead and georgia is in crisis yet the obama campaign has offered nothing more than cheap and petty political attacks that are echoed only by the kremlin
3119329 the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about sen obamas judgment it answers them

3119397 the conservative movement has hauled the orthodox establishment out in a way they hadnt anticipated
3119398 were not looking to horn in on the business were looking to expand the envelope so the kosher consumer can buy things that they feel good about
3119399 if i had more money i would have stayed and never gone back
3119400 we hear from other returnees that they had regret going back because there is still bombing kidnapping and killing
3119401 god willing the flights will continue in order to fetch all families that wish to come back we welcome all our citizens who want to come home
3119402 some iraqis are choosing to return because the situation has improved in their areas but many others find themselves under many pressures in the host countries as their savings and resources have been exhausted
3119403 im concerned that i will not be able go out freely whenever and wherever i want like i used to do in egypt
3119404 i dont know how we are going to cope with our new lives it is going to be hard with no security electricity or enough drinkable water
3119405 it is of our duty to rebuild our country and to help rid it of sectarianism
3119406 look at the double standards of this government it did not help us during all the bad times in exile but when it came to its own political gains they sent a plane to get us back probably to our death
3119407 he just fell down then he got up picked up his gun and started walking again
3119408 there was no indication the person was headed to the school
3119409 overall the situation was handled well and i am relieved everyone is safe
3119410 for breakfast they have a glass of chocolate milk and chocolate cake
3119411 they need a healthy body as well as a healthy soul
3119412 they are attributing it back to maybe a helmet to helmet hit that happened saturday
3119413 whether it is a concussion or a bell ringer or how you tell the difference im not certain
3119414 going up there with four guys we were really one
3119415 we all had to swim the perfect race and we swam that perfect race today
3119416 i let out a pretty fierce yell it just shows how emotional that race was and how excited we were it was just an amazing race we had to do everything as a team to win that race and we did
3119417 i think he likes the aspect of having it not be about him because so much of it is
3119418 i think he loves that he loves getting with those guys and he likes team sports he likes watching basketball and football this is the one time he gets to really be a part of something
3119419 i would say outside the pool im not really that flexible i dont know what it is there are things i cant do out of the water that other people can do its completely different in the water you put me in another sport i can get by but its not the best situation
3119420 in basketball i had the height thats about it i cant dunk and im 6 4 thats pretty pathetic baseball i dont know if its like moving different ways to get to the ball sliding whatever but its not me i dont have very much hand eye coordination either
3119421 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting
3119422 the best way to stop counterfeiting is ongoing collaboration between companies government agencies and law enforcement
3119423 people already shop with us and know our grooming so theyre comfortable with us
3119424 opening this sort of facility was a natural extension because of our take on pets that pets are part of the family
3119425 this sort of care is kind of an interesting phenomenon
3119426 its sort of a social trend couples are waiting longer to have kids and so their pets become their kids we love our animals and we want to make sure they have they best care
3119427 its the start of something that can be great weve been waiting for years for this moment
3119428 i dont know how many people were watching the game but it was an honor to play in it
3119429 we were all excited and anxious this game was over the top
3119430 i dont know if you can hear me right now
3119431 but if i am responsible i am sorry if i am the reason you died please please forgive me
3119432 little evidence that coffee and or caffeine in typical dosages increases the risk
3119433 i think everything needs change a fresh start fresh ideas
3119434 the economy the environment the price of gas education health care
3119435 new hampshire is one of the five seats we expect to win
3119436 jeanne shaheen read the press release from chuck schumer she didnt read the legislation and she came out for the wrong bill
3119437 have been out of step from where the voters of new hampshire are
3119438 its probably the best test out there of a political climate being a republican incumbents worst enemy
3119439 he does constituent service he shows up to work he votes he brings home the bacon there are not a lot of inherent things wrong with john sununu except that he is a republican
3119440 but with the economy going the way it has been going the last few years nobody in any office looks too good right now
3119441 that kind of effective leadership will be contrasted by the media by me by others to the things she failed to do as governor
3119442 she raised spending to record levels which i think people have come to expect from liberal democrats
3119443 when i am out on the campaign trail talking to people in new hampshire i dont hear people say we need to elect a democrat
3119444 what i hear them say is we need to change the direction of this country
3119445 whats important is that you cast a vote that is based in principle
3119446 at different things and try to fit them into the puzzle
3119447 its challenging for the scratch golfer but playable by your aunt tillie
3119448 ok surely hes not gonna come in now having just gotten passed good by whts s face but oh my look hes coming in again
3119449 you always want to know if you still can play tennis well enough that is why i decided to come back and have a game there is a good group of guys playing on the black rock tour of champions im very lucky to play with some good friends as well so its to find out if i can still compete with these guys and so far it has been ok
3119450 when it gets into tight situations you can forget what the correct play is there can be two or three points turning a match and if you dont win those points sometimes you can lose those matches i think that is probably the biggest thing
3119451 im staying fit back home doing a lot of fitness work ive done a lot of running so my legs are ok my heart is ok im feeling strong but i will see how much fun it is when i wake up tomorrow i think im going to be sore
3119452 goran ivanisevic said its incredible how slow the grass is now he spoke to federer about it and told me thats why federer doesnt serve and volley its just too slow i think wimbledon needs to change its grass and make it quicker because to me watching grass court tennis from the baseline is not how it should be played on grass its fine for clay but not for grass i think they should make it quicker
3119453 well i think you have to learn to be very patient and learn how to play on clay i think its a very good grounding for players over in europe they have very good clay court tennis and that makes you very tough thats the problem back in australia we dont have that i also think its important not to stay in junior tennis when you are 17 or 18 so get involved in mens tennis as quick as you can because its a very different game
3119454 this is my city i will never leave it even if the russians come here and kill me why should i go to tbilisi and wait for them there
3119455 what a joke bush amp eu have become such hypocrisy can rarely have been seen in recent history
3119456 georgia doesnt have any oil so the us wont help
3119457 president saakashvili ordered troops to pull out of the region
3119458 and were fed better than russians during all soviet history didnt they
3119459 i looked into his eyes and found a man i could trust
3119460 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
3119461 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
3119462 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
3119463 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
3119464 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
3119465 what is the ultimate proof of indian citizenship if even a foreigner can get an indian passport
3119466 a passport is a document issued by our government permitting us to travel to other countries how many countries will agree to give us visas on our passports once it becomes known that even a foreigner or a terrorist from another country can acquire an indian passport without verification
3119467 let alone admitting to the fact that more and more bangladeshi nationals are getting themselves registered as indian citizens thanks to their easy access to crucial documents like ration cards and even passports the state government seems to be reluctant even to admit the presence of infiltrators and has all along been maintaining a casual approach on the issue if the state government needed any further proof of cross border influx as also the evil designs behind the infiltration the high court ruling should wake it up from its slumber
3119468 if the government is really serious in detection and deportation of foreigners without harassment of genuine indian citizens the process of updating the national register of citizens nrc should be expedited and photo identity cards should be given to all genuine indian citizens on the basis of that

3119482 what job requires you doing work in order to get paid
3119483 a huge problem with getting people especially consumers to realise what is done to women in pornography is rape sexual abuse harassment etc is the fact that that is what sex is under male supremacy
3119484 secondly i think the sex positive view is that porn is not
3119485 while i dont agree with the evils of porn as laid out by demonista i do agree that since porn sex scenes almost always stop when the man ejaculates porn does tend to perpetuate this idea at least
3119486 those who are critical of the ejaculation industry sadopatriarchy bdsm intercourse double penetration and so forth to be regarded as anti sex
3119487 as a consumer and porn critic i can say with authority that women who dont really want to be in porn get out fast quickly replaced by the next ambitious starlet in line

3119505 we are implementing aggressive measures to reduce our costs through reductions in personnel the consolidation of south texas operations to kingsville dome which resulted in the closure of the corpus christi office the reduction of legal professional services and consulting fees and increased cost discipline to bring spending in line with the current uranium pricing environment and our lower levels of production
3119506 we have stated over the past two years that our intention is to produce for profits not pounds our spending is focused on selective areas of wellfield development with the least amount of production risk at current prices this restricts what is available in our known reserves for potential production therefore our capital investments will be limited to building reserves through exploration and acquisition and on developing better producing wellfields
3119507 our objective is to conserve cash as we address the two primary issues of the company we need to build reserves in texas to capitalize on the excellent production facilities we have and we need to make progress in new mexico in order to produce our large resource base there
3119508 we have reached a milestone in the process and continue to follow the path set for us by the sec

3119583 its entertainment thats set up by people who are high minded enough to not be racist or offensive
3119584 the whole film is based on the idea that what we actors do at some level is offensive and who we are at some level is despicable and pathetic which is the truth and not the truth but the part of it that is the truth is entertaining
3119585 by the supremacy of whiteness blackness had to by necessity be its foil be its opposite

3119602 nbc has a lot at stake both in terms of the event and a promotional platform for a new television season

3119604 they have a lot of big commitments to huge advertisers what else were they going to do
3119605 i dont think there is a corporate halo that carries over because i liked the olympics on nbc i will watch nbc programming i dont think it works that way

3119619 are at an acceptable level of security in my opinion
3119620 were just under 29 000 today because weve been very active getting them into the isf iraqi security forces primarily the police and some in the army

3119622 right now the jobs just arent available in those numbers we hope to have them trained or educated to join the security forces
3119623 because they were recruited quickly and put on the streets
3119624 i think its important we have this sentiment of security and the only way we can have it is by being very transparent in the investigation that will be put forward by the minister of public security
3119625 i was very clear with him this morning that this has to be done as soon as possible and the information will be made public

3119718 das russische friedenskontingent ist in der georgisch s dossetischen und der georgisch abchasischen konfliktzone stationiert um die gefahr einer wiederholten aggression gegen s dossetien zu bannen

3119733 die gewaltanwendung l uft den prinzipien des europarates sowie den verpflichtungen zur friedlichen beilegung von konflikten zuwider die f r die erlangung der ziele der organisation von entscheidender bedeutng sind
3119734 die von den russischen beh rden angegebenen gr nde k nnen kampfhandlungen auf dem territorium georgiens ob in s dossetien oder in anderen regionen der republik nicht rechtfertigen
3119735 of course as anglicans we feel free to call it just that an assumption

3119746 voter apathy voters are apathetic when they cannot see the relationship between their vote and making things happen when they do not think they will make a difference for bahais the relationship is clear as all bahais as a tenet of their faith are engaged in service to humanity and as voting is one form of service and election to office only but another voter turn out at bah elections tends to be high
3119747 this is consistent with our view that consumer spending will slow markedly over the next several quarters

3119758 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

3119776 while the canadian immigration system separates residency from work permits the u s bundles the two together the u s immigration act which contains about 75 visa categories needs to be overhauled

3119800 post when youve got something interesting to say post when you have content that forwards the aims of your business post when youve got something that will go viral and bring you tons of links and new subscribers most of all post something of value to your intended audience
3119801 although the hunt for al qaeda terrorists continues the primary threat to the stability of afghanistan is taliban insurgents who are challenging isaf in greater numbers sowing dissent among afghanis cooperating with the bourgeoning narcotics trade and complicating security efforts in ways that inhibit the rule of law and reconstruction
3119802 to overcome these challenges and similar ones we must reverse the downward spiral of defense budgets only a handful of members spend more than 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense good intentions can only carry a military force so far
3119803 it is imperative that nato fulfills its commitments to afghanistan the alliance has found it difficult to generate the political will to meet nato objectives unfortunately nato capitals are making the military mission even more difficult by placing national caveats on the use of their forces these restrictions coupled with troop shortages are making isaf a less cohesive and capable force
3119804 to the nato mission to prevent wars and not fight them he then outlined a key problem which a less than united europe should consider
3119805 in the coming decades the most likely source of armed conflict in the european theater and the surrounding regions will be energy scarcity and manipulation it would be irresponsible for nato to decline involvement in energy security when it is abundantly apparent that the jobs health and security of our modern economies and societies depend on the sufficiency and timely availability of diverse energy resources
3119806 our experiences provide little reason to be confident that market rationality will be the governing force behind energy policy and transactions
3119807 as recently as four years ago spare production capacity exceeded world oil consumption by about ten percent as world demand for oil has rapidly increased in the last few years spare capacity has declined to two percent or less thus even minor disruptions of oil supply can drive up prices
3119808 we are used to thinking in terms of conventional warfare between nations but energy could become the weapon of choice for those who possess it it may seem to be a less lethal weapon than military force but a natural gas shutdown to a european country in the middle of winter could cause death and economic loss on the scale of a military attack
3119809 article five of the nato charter identifies an attack on one member as an attack on all we should recognize that there is little ultimate difference between a member being forced to submit to foreign coercion because of an energy cutoff and a member facing a military blockade or other military demonstration on its borders
3119810 i believe that russia has a long term interest in achieving a more prosperous stability that comes with greater investment in its energy sector and the development of a reputation as a trusted supplier
3119811 i understand that adopting energy security as a mission is a major advancement from natos origins but it represents an historic opportunity to change the circumstances of geopolitics to the benefit of all members
3119812 maintaining a strategic balance will mean that our strategic deterrent forces should be able to guarantee the neutralization of any potential aggressor no matter what modern weapon systems he possesses
3119813 we will begin to equip the topol m mobile missile system with multiple re entry vehicles in a few years

3119827 at the time ubs was merging and to get this through in us it was not helpful to have these class actions about it was a financial deal in the interest of all parties

3119832 given the poor performance of these sensing devices there is no reason to believe that the other proposed protections such as beacons will be any more capable of providing reliable and robust interference protection to wireless microphone transmissions

3119840 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

3119843 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3119844 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

3119848 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3119849 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3119850 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3119851 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3119852 robbie coltrane is not the burglar but imagine him aged 16 with lank greasy hair and you have the picture
3119853 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3119854 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3119855 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3119856 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3119857 we had fresh legs and it was a very good practice
3119858 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3119859 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3119860 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3119861 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3119862 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3119863 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3119864 marking the bands biggest first week sales since 1996s trial by fire
3119865 almost sounds like a country song then thankfully it gets better
3119866 and really arnels powerful voice is well blended into that wondrous journey sound only neal schons guitar deens drums valorys bass guitar and cains keyboards could create
3119867 this is made in a true journey fashion if youre only now discovering journey this is one album
3119868 the ninth track has that right raspiness in arnels voice and despite the somewhat trite lyrics actually has the potential of becoming a hit too given continues airplays it has that commercial sound thats why perhaps the
3119869 with lyrics like that how can you not love journey
3119870 wonderful revelation for arnel pineda and journey cd album review
3119871 no no im not talking about that we came here to play theres no need to mix politics and sport
3119872 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3119873 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3119874 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3119875 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3119876 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3119877 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3119878 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3119879 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3119880 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3119881 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3119882 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3119883 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3119884 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3119885 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3119886 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3119887 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3119888 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3119889 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3119890 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3119891 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3119892 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3119893 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3119894 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3119895 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3119896 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3119897 we are aware of this matter and necessary measures have been taken against them we have clear guidelines for all employees in funcom not least those who work with customer service and if the guidelines are broken there are consequences
3119898 this is the behaviour that is not accepted by funcom

3119923 dear lord crimson we regret to inform you that we have exhausted our current supply of ideas and must now insist that you foist your eccentricities off upon one of our other able associates
3119924 put this on the desk please and well decipher its meaning in the morning
3119925 i wish to know if a firm by this name exists and if it does i want a meeting with whoever runs the company whatever it takes i want a meeting this week
3119926 this lord crimson character is paying you a hundred grand just for a meeting
3119927 i mean at the very least you could use the diversion dont you think
3119928 i guess ill tell you what though im definitely intrigued ive done a little digging around and apparently this guys driven at least a dozen firms stark raving mad
3119929 it seems that his lordship doesnt know what he wants and at the same time he knows exactly what he wants
3119930 yes well before i explain why i requested this meeting why dont you tell me a little something about this chap who works for you this rick st michael
3119931 why not start with the reason you think so highly of him
3119932 tell me why you lit up like a christmas tree at the mention of his name
3119933 forgive me i assume its his design skills youre most interested in so let me make it simple for you rick st michael is the best architect ive ever known he is in fact in a class by himself aside from a keen eye and disturbingly good artistic skills rick has an uncanny knack for knowing better than the client what he wants
3119934 something i like even more about rick is that even though hes treated pretty much like royalty in most circles he remains completely unassuming not to mention the fact that he could have struck out on his own years ago but i gave him his start and now that our friendship has grown into something we both cherish above almost anything in the world he remains loyal and will stay at my side forever
3119935 there is one other thing sir and to me its the most important of all ive a feeling it will be to you as well
3119936 the most unusual indeed the most extraordinary little girl ive ever encountered and their love for each other it just makes me feel that alls right with the world

3119945 in a way joel yes in developed countries people got too greedy especially bankers and everyone borrowed too much in less developed countries people racing to improve their living standards reawakened the slumbering inflation monster
3119946 why did the gigantic global bubble burst of 2008 catch people unawares werent there any warning signs granddad
3119947 with hindsight joel water should have set alarm bells ringing before the giglobubu wealthy people paid
3119948 cyprus started buying water from its neighbor greece because its dams were down to 7
3119949 did people collect rainwater for drinking like we do granddad
3119950 ive noticed how grumpy you get if theres not enough for you to make coffee in the morning
3119951 what did the central banks do granddad werent they the ones in charge of the economy
3119952 well the most important parts of the global economy were certainly ruled by independent inflation targeting central banks
3119953 capitalism sowed the seeds of its own demise because the benefits of a decade long boom accrued to capital with nothing flowing to labor telling workers who hadnt had a decent pay raise for years to tighten their belts once the good times ended proved disastrous
3119954 people started to realize that just because communism had lost that didnt mean capitalism had won
3119955 then the euro one of capitalisms crowning achievements began to unravel
3119956 with banks and mortgage lenders going bust faster than the government could arrange bailouts every nut job with an internet connection started demanding a return to something called the gold standard

3119959 following the transfer of our financial guaranty business to our mortgage insurance business we do not believe radian will need additional capital in the near term

3119982 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3119983 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3119984 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3119985 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

3119990 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
