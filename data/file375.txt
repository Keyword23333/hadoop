3750012 you know i am not sure voters will hold it against him as long as he is out there visible through tv ads pressing the flesh
3750013 it is hard to imagine a decision like that doing anything but hurting johnson
3750014 one main challenge was to reassure people that he is up to the job and one of the most important ways to have voters make that judgment is a debate and he has acknowledged that hes not up to that
3750015 since we have become public the company has made substantial progress in building both the exploration production and energy services businesses
3750016 we have also incurred additional costs as a public entity that we did not have as a private company as the companys largest shareholder i felt it was appropriate to help defray some of these expenses by eliminating my compensation this year in order to enhance capital citys earnings increased earnings directly affects the value of the shares

3750031 we can expect to see cyber attacks being increasingly used as a weapon alongside physical attacks the benefits of using such methods are that no one is directly physically hurt or killed and it is much harder to pinpoint the source and who is involved
3750032 furthermore cost makes this a really appealing option as it is far less expensive and more simple to instigate than a full scale military attack yet still creates maximum levels of destruction as well as being a critical resource for government ministries the internet also plays an important role in the running of countries and this disruption can damage economies and severely impact the running of services governments need to have in place strategies to prepare for this type of attack and to ensure that resources can be sustained at all times

3750035 young children and adults with serious dental issues are being made to suffer because of consistent underfunding of this state scheme
3750036 the hse does acknowledge that dentists have withdrawn from the dtss dental treatment services scheme scheme however a substantial number of new contracts have also been agreed on that basis any overall reduction in the number of dentists operating under the dtss scheme has been relatively small

3750050 were helping the family right now and well deal with the other issues later
3750051 demonstrates the companys commitment to making outstanding wine that is consistent reliable and above all a great value
3750052 all i can say is that i had to clean up a shark carcass from the ward that mr scheider was in
3750053 there were quite a few bullets in the body of the shark that is and alot of blood splattered around the room but i cant be sure if it was the blood of the shark or mr scheider or a combination of both
3750054 the family has requested a traditional service with a few things changed
3750055 firstly as it is a cremation mr scheiders coffin will be rolled into the mouth of an animatronic shark accompanied by the appropriate sound effects
3750056 also his ashes will be fired from a harpoon in a smaller more private occasion for close family a few days later the harpoon will be fired from a boat that was used in the filming of jaws
3750057 dad they all have little tiny ones but mine is ten times bigger than theirs is that because im from philadelphia
3750058 the internet in china is developing very rapidly and there are already more than 200 million users it is everyones common aspiration to have a good internet environment
3750059 we believe that the explicit material currently offered on the internet does not align with the wishes of the entire chinese population
3750060 and as such we will be blocking access to these sites
3750061 however we realise the important role that pornography plays in our society namely that if a chinese male is watching pornography he is not having intercourse with another person thus helping to alleviate the great overpopulation problem that our great country faces
3750062 so for that reason we will be providing state sponsored sexually explicit material that is beneficial for our nation for example all scenes in such films will be required to have a chinese flag somewhere in the background
3750063 also when a woman reaches climax during the process of sexual intercourse she will be required to scream out the name of our great president hu jintao
3750064 in our research of the current material available we have discovered that most plot points in said pornography are immoral there will be no muscle bound pool man visiting a lonely housewife in our state sponsored versions as this blatant adultery is not considered appropriate instead morally acceptable stories such as a wife showing her appreciation of her husbands new promotion will be used
3750065 the music will not change boom chicka wah wah is morally acceptable
3750066 its a problem that any 12 year old with a couple of hours of experience on the internet could probably fix its a very simple fix you just export the data
3750067 weve searched high and low even looking for children as young as 9 and as old as 15
3750068 since daniel unoying anklebiter seems to know so much about this internet stuff maybe he is technically competent enough to help us here
3750069 yeah and yet mikeys always moaning cos other people shout the power has totally gone to his head as head of house
3750070 the clintons know that a lot of democrats are muttering that their solipsistic behavior is disgusting but theyre too filled with delicious schadenfreude at the wave of buyers remorse that has swept the democratic party many democrats are questioning whether obama is fighting back hard enough against mccain and many are wondering given his inability to open up a lead in a country fed up with republicans if race will be an insurmountable factor
3750071 wir streben kurzfristig weitere verhandlungen an und wollen zu einer schnellen l sung zu kommen

3750073 nicht zuletzt aus unternehmensstrategischen gr nden ist es nicht angemessen eine reine abwehrpolitik zu verfolgen
3750074 wenn denn ein schaeffler engagement strategisch sinnvoll ist dann kann nicht nur die h he einer beteiligung im fokus stehen vielmehr kommt es darauf an die bedingungen und modalit ten einer beteiligung vern nftig zu gestalten es gilt die chancen auszuloten

3750082 you hate for your second quarterback to play linebacker and right now corry would be our strong safety and outside linebacker
3750083 weve played together so long i think this year will be a breakout season
3750084 through the regular season we were competitive with everybody we played
3750085 the farragut and maryville losses each by one point came down to the last seconds i think weve got a good core of kids coming back to continue that successful track
3750086 theres more of a drive this year because of how good we were and then we got cut off by bearden 30 0 loss in the playoffs
3750087 our defense will be as good or better than we were last year
3750088 at the same age we think hes even a little better than t j was
3750089 the easiest level is making freezer jams or refrigerator pickles
3750090 these are the things that go on the shelf not in your refrigerator most of them require a little more prep work like chopping and dicing
3750091 some people get really confused about this they think if they have a canner they have a pressure canner but if the lid doesnt clamp down and if it doesnt have a pressure gauge its not a pressure canner
3750092 the university of tennessee agriculture extension office will test them for free
3750093 you absolutely have to follow the guidelines for instance if you are canning a jar of mixed vegetables you must calculate the cooking and processing time for the vegetable that requires the most cooking time
3750094 the ball blue book of canning is like the canning bible
3750095 tomatoes are tricky old fashioned heirloom tomatoes generally have high acid but some of the new fangled hybrids especially the sweet varieties dont if the acidity level is below 4 6 ph which is the magic number then you can hot water bath the item i like it to be well below 4 6 at least a 4 before i prepare it that way
3750096 they run about 60 to 80 but its better than death

3750149 obviously there were concerns within apple that our product might be harmful to some people in the population who rely on pacemakers to survive
3750150 but there were rumors that suggested a new type of ipod might be designed for the pacemaker market
3750151 we all thought that it would be a great new market for apple
3750152 but with this new study purportedly proving that the ipod is safe they still havent revealed any details if they were going to make an announcement today would have been ideal
3750153 they havent found a proper entry point for the ipod product

3750219 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3750220 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3750221 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3750224 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3750225 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3750226 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

3750440 plant city detective mark holste had been on the force for 18 years when he and his young partner were sent to the house on old sydney road to stand by during a child abuse investigation someone had finally called the police
3750441 they found a car parked outside the drivers door was open and a woman was slumped over in her seat sobbing she was an investigator for the florida department of children and families
3750442 first he saw the girls eyes dark and wide unfocused unblinking she wasnt looking at him so much as through him
3750443 she lay on a torn moldy mattress on the floor
3750444 the pile of dirty diapers in that room must have been 4 feet high the detective said the glass in the window had been broken and that child was just lying there surrounded by her own excrement and bugs
3750445 when he bent to lift her she yelped like a lamb it felt like i was picking up a baby holste said i put her over my shoulder and that diaper started leaking down my leg
3750446 the girl didnt struggle holste asked whats your name honey the girl didnt seem to hear
3750447 he searched for clothes to dress her but found only balled up laundry flecked with feces
3750448 the mothers statement was im doing the best i can the detective said
3750449 so the detective carried the girl down the dim hall past her brothers past her mother in the doorway who was shrieking dont take my baby
3750450 her caseworker determined that she had never been to school never seen a doctor she didnt know how to hold a doll didnt understand peek a boo due to the severe neglect a doctor would write the child will be disabled for the rest of her life
3750451 the doctors and social workers had no way of knowing all that had happened to danielle but the scene at the house along with danielles almost comatose condition led them to believe she had never been cared for beyond basic sustenance hard as it was to imagine they doubted she had ever been taken out in the sun sung to sleep even hugged or held she was fragile and beautiful but whatever makes a person human seemed somehow missing
3750452 bernie and diane already thought of danielle as their daughter but legally she wasnt danielles birth mother did not want to give her up even though she had been charged with child abuse and faced 20 years in prison so prosecutors offered a deal if she waived her parental rights they wouldnt send her to jail
3750453 michelle crockett lives in a mobile home in plant city with her two 20 something sons three cats and a closet full of kittens the trailer is just down the road from the little house where she lived with danielle
3750454 on a steamy afternoon a few weeks ago michelle opens the door wearing a long t shirt when she sees two strangers she ducks inside and pulls on a housecoat shes tall and stout with broad shoulders and the sallow skin of a smoker she looks tired older than her 51 years

3750456 the inside of the trailer is modest but clean dishes drying on the counter silk flowers on the table sitting in her kitchen chain smoking 305s she starts at the end the day the detective took danielle
3750457 for hours michelle crockett spins out her story tapping ashes into a plastic ashtray everything she says sounds like a plea but for what understanding sympathy she doesnt apologize far from it she feels wronged
3750458 danielle she says was born in a hospital in las vegas a healthy baby who weighed 7 pounds 6 ounces her apgar score measuring her health was a 9 nearly perfect
3750459 she goes to the boys bathroom returns with a box full of documents and hands it over
3750460 the earliest documents are from feb 11 2002 that was when someone called the child abuse hotline on her the caller reported that a child about 3 was left unattended for days with a retarded older brother never seen wearing anything but a diaper
3750461 this is michelle s proof that her sons were watching danielle
3750462 when danielle was in the hospital michelle says she and her sons sneaked in to see her michelle took a picture from the file danielle drowning in a hospital gown slumped in a bed that folded into a wheelchair
3750463 she reaches up and with her finger traces her daughter s face when i moved here she says that was the first thing i hung

3750469 next year i will be shooting for sure as it will be my 40th year representing canada at the world level but four years from now when you put so much in there its really agonizing its really hard to fall on your butt
3750470 i was in front of the targets behind the targets over the targets and under the targets it was really a mess
3750471 i did the same preparation for the third round as i did for the first two rounds and it just wasnt there i had physio for my back because of the old woman i am i played cards and was beating my brother gary
3750472 i dont know maybe i was too relaxed i probably was trying too hard
3750473 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3750474 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
3750475 washington concerns about foreign spies and terrorists has prompted the homeland security department to set up its own counterintelligence division and require strict reporting from employees about foreign travel according to a memo obtained by the associated press
3750476 i have endured that stigma for fifteen years its fair to say it has ruined my life yet until now i have never received the slightest apology from the authorities for my ordeal

3750525 after going through some of the different options carl is going to have surgery on thursday in arizona
3750526 its a six to eight week recovery its a fairly simple procedure but its something that the downside was too great if we didnt go ahead and get it taken care of now were fairly optimistic hell be able to return in six weeks but well know a lot more once hes a couple of weeks into the recovery
3750527 if every single thing went extremely well there is a chance he could play in a regular season game
3750528 so much of it will be based on how well the surgery goes how well the rehab is going how his hand is progressing
3750529 once we get three or four weeks into this thing well have a much better feel for whether hell be able to return in the regular season and if he would be eligible for anything thereafter
3750530 yeah that seems reasonable well re x ray it and go through that process again i think its very reasonable as were sitting here today but as everybody knows bones heal at different paces and its too hard to say definitively at this point

3750533 this has been a great festival that has seen record numbers attending events from the opening carnival parade we new it was going to be good
3750534 this event can only take place because of a huge contribution and effort from a number of people
3750535 i dont believe there could have been an alternative to political conflict
3750536 i never regretted joining the ira even to this day it changed the face of history in the north
3750537 mr mcguinness commented that the need for violence ended in my mind one could also pursue ones aims democratically
3750538 there is no indication that the majority of people in northern ireland would vote for a united ireland
3750539 by ending the violence we knew we would not get everything we wanted but we had changed the course of the political landscape to work towards reunification of our country
3750540 this event gives people the opportunity to participate in politics by discussion and debate this event is very important because it lets local people address the hard issues of today
3750541 farming is a pivotal part of our way of life in ards we are fortunate to have such a rich rural heritage in ards and our community and our economy benefits from that we all know that farming is an industry that faces day in and day out challenges
3750542 i believe that the proposed sites for the 10 dard directs deeply disadvantages many of my constituents as the map on page 41 of the consultation clearly shows large sections of north down and ards which are heavily farmed areas are not within a 16 mile radius of one of the new one stop shops
3750543 this contrasts starkly with parts of counties londonderry and antrim where as many as three dard directs will be within a 16 mile radius of some locations
3750544 indeed i would suggest that whilst the lower section of the ards peninsula is shown to be within a 16 mile radius of the proposed dard direct in downpatrick this simple drawing of a circle on a map does not take into account geographical factors like the need to cross strangford lough and the attendant difficulties this can bring
3750545 as it has already been modified to test the dard direct service delivery model
3750546 the dard direct offices will be strategically located across northern ireland within a reasonable distance of customers businesses
3750547 the department is currently undertaking an equality impact assessment eqia on the roll out of dard direct across northern ireland following consideration of the feedback from the consultation decisions will be made on where the dard direct offices will be located
3750548 however it is stressed that apart from inishkeen house in enniskillen these are not necessarily final locations
3750549 no decision will be taken on either the number of remaining dard direct offices or their final locations until all the feedback received through the eqia consultation process has been carefully considered
3750550 dard would encourage anyone who has issues or concerns about the roll out of dard direct to contact us with their views as part of this consultation

3750590 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims

3750600 it was very difficult because of the weather and everyone and everything was getting a bit soggy
3750601 but the support we had from people was excellent and they were very firm in their opinion that this service should not be moved from suffolk and should be as close to those who need it as possible
3750602 we need now to keep pressing this matter with the countys health scrutiny committee because they are the last committee standing the only one which can do something to alter this situation and we hope they will
3750603 from those we spoke to it is clear people in felixstowe are worried about moving the head and neck cancer service they will have further than most folk to travel if they or their relatives were to need it

3750625 it is a very strong squad and its a sign of our intent for the season coming up not just for the under 21s but the seniors as well
3750626 fraizer campbell is a player that the hull fans will know well and he was a massive part of hull getting into the premier league
3750627 the fact he has been around the manchester united squad in pre season shows he is progressing and he showed an excellent attitude when he was involved in the under 21s at the end of last season
3750628 all of the players won things here but after we got relegated quite a few have found new clubs and some have retired as a result were in the process of rebuilding
3750629 to be honest weve not done very well in the fa cup recently weve been knocked out in the preliminaries and havent managed to progress for a few years so success for us this season would be to get through the two preliminary matches
3750630 were just hoping for a good game and a positive result we may get up to three figures as they sporting bengal are bringing a coach load down
3750631 we were just trying to do the same thing just trying to row fast and clean bumping it up a little bit focusing each bit down the race course
3750632 because were pretty new at this we were happy to just get our nose in it and be there with the other guys down the course
3750633 before we knew it we had 250 meters left and we went for it because we could smell the finish line that put us into the final and were pretty happy with that
3750634 we didnt position ourselves with much expectation coming into this regatta
3750635 the first heat saturday was our first racing piece ever in an international regatta this was our third
3750636 we came in with not a lot of expectations and weve been trying to use that to our advantage
3750637 we will try and play our natural game against him and see how it goes he does not bowl at 150 kmph so there is no reason to be frightened of him when murali was new to international cricket even he bothered many top batsmen and is still bothering them but with time batsmen learn more and adjust to the situations

3750649 we dont know that they were illegal if they were contributions from the campaign then obviously theres some issues there with legality but at this point were still trying to investigate that
3750650 and if you take that money that people have contributed to you based upon the fact that they think their money is going to a presidential candidate and you give it to a girlfriend of a god knows what thats a crime but the question is how do you prove that and she was somehow working for the campaign as its videographer so was the money she got so inappropriately more than what she deserved thats going to be the issue the feds are going to have to look at it would be a federal offense

3750658 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3750659 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual

3750666 the one human rights pledge that china made was that there would be a free media for the games and that just hasnt materialized
3750667 i can give you a general principle that is the chinese government adopts a positive and open attitude and welcomes foreign journalists coming to china and report on the beijing olympics

3750698 we are delighted with the popularity of fishtext and feedback so far indicates that users are extremely pleased with the service
3750699 fishtexts success demonstrates that traditional text messaging is an overpriced and underdeveloped service many users have expressed surprise that the fishtext mobile application delivers text messages all over the world so reliably for just a couple of pence while their own operator charges over ten times that amount with some not even providing delivery reports or charging extra for them

3750706 our results show that almost half of people questioned felt they had bought their endowment policy on a false promise this is not just a case of a small purchase this is thousands of pounds for a house that we are talking about
3750707 there are several reasons that somebody may have been mis sold an endowment policy including a lack of adequate explanation an endowment policy is not a short term commitment and this should have been made clear when the policy was bought as should the fees and risks involved
3750708 without this information people were unable to make an informed decision and should be able to claim some compensation depending on the circumstances
3750709 in collaboration with the co located ict symposium this years event will combine telecommunications solutions with innovations for enterprise
3750710 the exhibition and workshops will cover technology business strategic and operational issues on topics such as mobility collaboration security and risk management and address the most promising alternatives for moving forward in the ict industry
3750711 a great opportunity to see what is happening what is on the future time path and great interaction with all of the professionals around the world
3750712 i was able to read the tutors article about his recent concert tour and so get some background information about him before getting in touch
3750713 with over 40 years experience in information security and having worked closely with the information security forum it is clear that its role is more important than ever
3750714 information security is no longer just a technical challenge it is a business imperative and is or should be on the top of boardroom agendas in every corporation the isf is a unique organization that provides a confidential peer to peer forum for members across different countries sectors and disciplines and is able to draw on their diverse skills and expertise to distill best practice and deliver an unmatched portfolio of research methodologies and tools
3750715 it is a distinct privilege to be the first president of the isf and i look forward to working with the dedicated professionals that have brought the isf to the position it is today i will strive to help raise greater awareness of the information security challenges faced today from the increase in cybercrime to the growing burden of compliance companies need to adopt a risk management perspective and recognize that information security is business driven and not crisis driven
3750716 we are delighted that howard schmidt has accepted this important position at the isf
3750717 the value of the isf has always been born out of the people in the organization its members our expert consultants and the management team it is clear that howards unparalleled experience and knowledge will make a major contribution to the future of the isf and its members he will also be driving our ambitious plans to expand the scale and reach of the isf building on our existing membership from europe and scandinavia through the americas to the middle east india africa australia and the pacific rim
3750718 good email delivered to the inbox is welcomed but people hate spam and are equally frustrated when valid email is unnecessarily blocked however the picture has improved significantly in recent years today all the parties involved in email marketing recognise that they have to collaborate if the industry is to combat spam and ensure that the medium achieves its potential
3750719 a growing spirit of openness has seen isps become richer sources of information which in turn enables email marketers to respond by using the sophisticated capabilities of lyris listmanager 10 everyone wins because less spam is delivered and more legitimate messages get in to the inbox
3750720 ensuring that email messages make it to the inbox continues to be a critical challenge for email marketers particularly as spam volumes increase and internet service providers isps change their guidelines for which messages get delivered
3750721 the online retail market is fiercely competitive consumers expect to be able to shop quickly and easily even minor glitches in this process will lead customers to abandon their trolleys and go elsewhere
3750722 to maintain its leadership position next has recognised the importance of enhancing the experience of every online visitor and providing them with the same superior level of service as they would expect in store or through next directory
3750723 the timing is right for this demonstration weve seen a massive increase of interest in targeted advertising and are already working with iptv broadcasters network owners and vendors not to mention advertising agencies and brands mobile tv is a vital part of the rapidly changing world of tv and is a vital part of our roadmap like packet vision udcast is a pioneer in its particular area of innovation with a proven track record and global reach so there is a natural synergy between the two companies
3750724 we expect targeted advertising to be an important element of mobile tv business models including free to air services where finding ways to generate revenue from advertising will be essential udcasts mobile tv solutions are compliant with majority of standards deployed across the world we are in an ideal position to provide the global platform for delivering mobile tv so it makes sense to work with packet vision which we believe is at the forefront of delivering targeted advertising technology on ip video networks
3750725 local councils can find out the number and cause of avoidable contacts which is the first step to reducing them
3750726 the fact that simple transactions are increasingly satisfied by consumer self service internet and systems means person to person contacts tend to be more complex and take longer
3750727 reducing avoidable contact gives more capacity to handle unavoidable contacts more effectively and reduce overall workload
3750728 our customers must be able to focus on their business objectives and keeping end user satisfaction high
3750729 working with toucan global demonstrates how realtunnel through its support for ice stun turn and https tunneling is a key contributor to optimizing end users voip experiences
3750730 with paradial toucan global can increase the availability and usefulness of the snap communicator
3750731 we can not act on the basis of ideology or preconceived notions
3750732 when this crisis began barack obama the administration indeed and all of our nato allies took a very measured and reasoned appraoch because we were dealing with the facts as we knew them john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive very belligerent statement and he may or may not have complicated the situation
3750733 during an international crisis when bipartisanship is needed most its unfortunate to see the obama campaign launch an inflammatory and baseless political attack
3750734 mccain is ready to be commander in chief on day one tested in war and peace he has passed both tests with honor that shows not only his ability but his character
3750735 georgia s territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3750736 we urge restraint on all sides that violence would be curtailed and that direct dialogue could ensue in order to help resolve their differences
3750737 and i believe that its important that we act in a bipartisan fashion now theres no room for partisanship now
3750738 there is a huge bottom line difference on what the nature of the u s relationship should be with russia
3750739 senator mccain has talked about that literally for years i think the first major speech he gave expressing concerns about russian policies in former warsaw pact or former soviet countries was in 1993 i don t know when was the first statement senator obama might have given about russia
3750740 second if you look at senator obama s statements about russia they principally talked about the need to engage in a cooperative relationship to address proliferation threats and securing loose nuclear materials he has talked relatively little about the issues i just spoke about now he has made a couple statements of support for a nato membership action plan for georgia and ukraine but again you cant compare a 15 year historical record with three or four statements over the course of 15 months
3750741 the chinese are keen to show they are in control they dont want to spoil the olympic party but there is no doubt this is a significant escalation
3750742 it is not just the quantity but the quality of the attacks that has changed they are becoming more dangerous
3750743 security should not become in any way a cover to try and deal with dissent
3750744 just wanted to remind you to get to the studio early enough to start inventory before it gets too busy
3750745 for two whole days i walked you to your classes
3750746 i wanted to let you know that i wont be at class for a while because i will be on trial for negligent homicide
3750747 i was driving with my fiance we flipped over a guardrail on the highway and she was killed
3750748 we have to prove that what he did in thailand was wrong under british law
3750749 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3750750 you could see lots of little fish about the size of sandals jumping out of the whales maw as it came out of the water
3750751 thats why were sure the whale is successfully and regularly feeding itself

3750753 um no thats okay can i just get a large dr pepper instead

3750758 most pr folks dont read blogs and certainly dont understand them
3750759 hes parked near a deli and a store that sells fruit
3750760 i think you all know there are two very vibrant neighborhoods on either side of this plan filled with quiet calm residents who are also taxpayers and voters
3750761 we all feel this is going to adversely affect our quality of life
3750762 we dont have the infrastructure to support this project at this time
3750763 i dont think as a council it would be prudent for us to move forward
3750764 i dont see it does any good to erase what weve already done
3750765 the working poor the struggling middle class have a right to live in every district in the city
3750766 have a conversation with at least one or two of the supervisors
3750767 i dont know anyone in the public transportation business who doesnt fear this could happen
3750768 borrowing transportation money is not a real fix its not a permanent fix for a budget out of balance
3750769 hes been pretty consistent that he wants a mix of new revenue and cuts though cuts only are not an option
3750770 borrowing our way out is not something he wants to do either
3750771 this is especially critical at a point in time the economy cant afford to take another hit
3750772 eliminating a critical source of funding will result in delays lost jobs and more traffic congestion for motorists
3750773 why not let affiliateshieldtm monitor all the sites for you automatically in real time 24 7 no fuss no mess no commission leaks
3750774 not found sorry but you are looking for something that isnt here
3750775 that boy had a big dick and gave it to me good
3750776 thats when you get a skinny boy and a big girl and i grab your ass and hold yo
3750777 its important that people realise that not having a degree isnt the end of the world
3750778 there are lots of options for young people to build a successful career in their industry of choice however if youre young and starting to make money its a good idea to start thinking about saving for the future nobodys young forever
3750779 many 16 21 year olds now make the choice to go straight to work rather than university and as a result are very career driven we think it is important to recognise those who are just starting out in their working life and offer them support especially in the first stages of their professional lives when they are likely to be making important financial decisions
3750780 with this in mind the premier 21 account has been launched to allow this group to maximise the potential of their hard earned cash the account offers a 10 interest rate the highest credit interest rate on the high street to help make their money go further

3750792 after several tests we decided to put lin miaoke on the live picture while using yang peiyis voice
3750793 the reason for this is that we must put our countrys interest first we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi we combined the perfect voice and the perfect performance
3750794 i dont want to soil my nest at channel seven
3750795 but i would be less than honest if i didnt say that i was very disappointed after being part of a successful team for seven successive series of dwts you would think that this news would have been given to me a lot sooner so as to free me up to secure other work but thats showbiz i guess
3750796 it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
3750797 from now on its just a downward slope the end is close i love it
3750798 i was half asleep listening to my walkman at the front of the bus when all of a sudden the van pulled in front of the bus the bus collided with the van and in turn moved off the road and hit a guard rail
3750799 there was another australian on the bus not sure who
3750800 he acted very quickly to try and do what he could to manage the situation
3750801 we were able to get one of the passengers from the back of the van out onto the road but the others were certainly very seriously injured
3750802 earlier reports that there were australian rowers on the bus are untrue
3750803 music videos and flowery speeches are one thing but the shelling of a city that you view as one of your heartland is not done lightly
3750804 clearly this is going to be a signal point in his legacy
3750805 in every generation there is a chosen one one girl in all the world one born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires
3750806 ich hatte die hoffnung dass ich dabei bin aber jetzt bin ich gl cklich dass es auch so gekommen ist
3750807 huge salinisation problems i have been there seen it some of the excessive approaches to modern forms of agriculture
3750808 if you are not working with natural assistance you cause untold problems which become very expensive and very difficult to undo it places impossible burdens on nature and leads to accumulating problems which become more difficult to sort out
3750809 why else are we facing all these challenges climate change and everything
3750810 absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3750811 if that is the case and we have humanitarian access australia as always will be in there through the appropriate international agencies including the red cross to provide practical humanitarian help

3750815 according to initial estimates the bomb was made up of 20 kilograms of explosives
3750816 now the army and the people are being targeted when it used to be the politicians who were the targets
3750817 this explosion is not in either lebanon or syrias interests
3750818 we are telling him to face it and make history not go resigning
3750819 there are very few people in pakistani history who know as much as president musharraf knows
3750820 governments here in pakistan can always manipulate numbers to do what they want

3750846 die studenten mussten zwei jahre voll harter arbeit und viele private entbehrungen auf sich nehmen der heutige tag widerspiegelt zugleich die gelungene zusammenarbeit beider hochschulen und schlie lich kann die medienstiftung ein klein wenig stolz sein wir haben die heutigen absolventen mit stipendien unterst tzt und mit dem mediencampus villa ida ein modernes bildungs und konferenzzentrum geschaffen
3750847 ich glaube es ist nicht bertrieben wenn ich sage dass heute ein historischer tag ist denn unsere absolventen halten die ersten zeugnisse berhaupt in der hand auf denen professor franz h user rektor der universit t und professor hubertus milke rektor der htwk gemeinsam unterschrieben haben

3750849 there arent any big cats here but theres just as much need for the same kinds of conservation of our native species

3750851 it was absolutely everything i dreamed about it was just spectacular
3750852 now that the warmer weather is upon us and grilling can become a regular routine in our menu options here are some easy tips for success i love grilling pork the flavor and texture from the grill only accentuates its sweet flavors using lean and organic cuts can be very healthful as well there are great pork farmers that can be easily accessed at places like whole foods and these days most local supermarkets stock them as well i recommend berkshire farms one of my favorites i always prepare my pork in a quick brine so that the meat especially the leaner cuts stay moist and keep the flavor when cooking as there is very little fat the meat can get dry otherwise here is a simple brine which can also be used for poultry if you prefer i suggest brushing some fresh peaches with olive oil and grilling them with a few springs of rosemary to serve right along side your pork

3750855 maybe something in my behavior or my speech perhaps made them uncomfortable
3750856 it wasnt as if theyd said were going to fire you because youre transgender
3750857 its understanding that policy is beast unto itself and you have to plan everything from how are insurance benefits handled to are there security clearance issues therere so many things to think about
3750858 but i do use the term transgender particularly for people who are not aware of the various types of identities that exist in the community
3750859 and i plan to stay with her the rest of my life
3750860 theres a generational divide if you look at the writing of younger people theres a lot more fluidity and acceptance of fluidity for sexual orientation and gender presentation and gender identity this borderland is slowly beginning to fade its not gone yet but younger peoples understanding of what it means to be a lesbian and what it means to be ftm is changing from its meaning in previous generations
3750861 my analysis indicates that its based on political division and internalized homophobia its a rejection by gays and lesbians of more radical forms of gay and lesbian sexuality those who are saying gays are different from transgender people are attempting to buy their freedom so to speak by saying were the normal ones its trying to scapegoat a particular portion of the community in an attempt to escape discrimination that has never worked in the past with any identity group its a totally failed policy but some people are clinging to it
3750862 its not about what you have the right to do behind closed shades
3750863 its about what right you have to lead your life publicly making certain private decisions its not about the right to live in the closet its saying that if you are gay if youre transgender you have the right to make that decision and the government may not interfere thats the direction were going in but theres a lot of work to be done the battle has just begun
3750864 many many individuals its not something that should be reserved to people who are quote activists or academics or scholars the way to do it is simply to in your own life come forward and educate people about issues of sexual orientation and gender identity ultimately thats whats going to change society a lot of transgender people are concerned about standing up too tall or too proud in society fearing that theyll be the target of violence and ridicule i think thats what needs to change in order to change society we need to stand up and be counted

3750871 uit een onderzoek van pricewaterhousecoopers blijkt dat 50 procent van de online lezers evenveel tijd aan de krantencontent besteedt dan in het gedrukte tijdperk en 35 procent zegt nu zelfs meer aan de krant te besteden
3750872 ondertussen zijn er ook nieuwe en snel groeiende nieuwsorganisaties bijgekomen
3750873 maar online is het potenti le publiek veel groter met veel kleinere productie en distributiekosten
3750874 dat cre ert een potentieel gigantische inkomstenbron de britse krant the guardian heeft slechts een oplage van 400 000 exemplaren maar kreeg vorige maand wel meer dan twintig miljoen bezoekers op zijn website
3750875 vele kranten beschouwen het internet nog altijd als een supplement zelfs al is het duidelijk geworden dat het internet het belangrijkste nieuwskanaal zal worden
3750876 er is nagenoeg geen enkele krant waarvan gezegd kan worden dat hij zijn gedrukte content daadwerkelijk heruitgevonden heeft de krantenpaginas staan nog altijd vol met saaie en zwaarwichtige stukken met onderwerpen die blijkbaar gekozen zijn door de instituten waarover wordt geschreven in plaats van onderwerpen die de lezer wellicht in belangrijke mate interesseren
3750877 het blijft grotendeels bij banners maar niemand blijkt te overwegen om bestaande content te gebruiken voor specifieke reclamebehoeftes om content te verkopen aan andere bedrijven of verkoopsinspanningen te leveren voor andere websites
3750878 dat zou de kranten kunnen doen evolueren tot zwaar winstgevende reclamenetwerken maar deze mogelijkheden blijven grotendeels onbenut
3750879 russische bedrijven zijn erop gebrand om hun uitrusting en machinepark te moderniseren
3750880 het is normaal dat ze dat proberen te doen met de hulp van een sterke betrouwbare en ervaren partner
3750881 dikwijls was het onduidelijk waar het geld vandaan kwam en wat de investeerders er exact mee van plan waren
3750882 verwacht kan worden dat dit de volgende jaren zal veranderen onder meer met de voorziene toetreding van rusland tot de world trade organization de situatie is ook verbeterd door de belofte van de nieuwe russische president om de thuismarkt te liberaliseren en corruptie te bestrijden
3750883 maar eens het over zakelijke en gedetailleerde overeenkomsten gaat verdwijnen de misverstanden en vooroordelen meestal vrij snel het is voor de duitse industriegemeenschap nog relatief nieuw om op deze schaal met russische partners om te gaan voorlopig helt de schaal echter nog altijd door in het voordeel van duitsland meer dan 4 000 duitse bedrijven waaronder reuzen zoals siemens bosch en basf zijn actief op de russische markt in duitsland zijn er slechts ongeveer 1 300 russische ondernemingen

3750888 deze fashion sites maken hun gebrek aan tastbare aantrekkingskracht goed door een multimediale ervaring met fotos muziek videos blogs en message boards met opini rende commentaren
3750889 voorlopig slagen ze er nog niet in om de reclame inkomsten van de modemagazines aan te tassen maar de belangrijkste websites beginnen inmiddels ook adverteerders aan te trekken een website is volgens imran armed uitgever van de nieuwssite the business of fashion veel dynamischer kan zijn content sneller plaatsen en een dialoog cre ren tussen mensen met dezelfde interesses
3750890 dit publiek bestaat uit influentials die voor het internet hebben gekozen daardoor leggen ze volgens arora de modetoekomst bij het internet
3750891 het grootste probleem voor deze webmagazines is een manier te vinden om deze fashionistas te bereiken het is moeilijk om op te vallen in een wildernis van blogs columns en nieuwsletters weinigen hebben bovendien een echte identiteit
3750892 maar in tegenstelling tot traditionele modemagazines die hun content al maanden voor publicatie hebben vastgelegd kunnen modewebsites hun content nagenoeg onmiddellijk updaten
3750893 het werk dat op een modeshow wordt getoond kan binnen de kortste keren online gezet worden
3750894 i had hoped for the eight a1s but i didnt really expect to get them
3750895 i thought that english hadnt gone that well but when i looked down at my results i was so happy to see the a1
3750896 its so satisfying to get the eight a1s because all the hard work over the nine months paid off
3750897 the more you think about the worse you think you did
3750898 i was never confident in irish and i left out a section of the letter in the german exam so i was very nervous about them but now im just elated
3750899 a patient will always tell you they smoke less than they do because they feel guilty as soon as you ask
3750900 smoking is like breathing in exhaust fumes so of course it is going to affect a mother and foetus but there are people who tell you their baby was fine even though they smoked throughout the pregnancy i would say perhaps the placenta didnt implant as well as it could have or vessel growth wasnt as optimal as it could have been if they had been non smokers
3750901 we need to make sure women are strongly advised against smoking every time they visit a health professional
3750902 in a classic business strategy of divide and conquer telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer

3750935 prejudice sympathy and such things have no part in a criminal trial
3750936 it is important that you determine the case on the evidence you have heard not on any other idea or comment you may have heard
3750937 learning at this age is a great joy as you are not answerable to anyone nor is there any obligation you feel young when you learn something new also you can learn at your own pace
3750938 you have plenty of time in hand further studies have shown that constant learning has the ability to keep dementia at bay by giving work to your brain you are not idle and dont give way to depression you spend your time following your interests
3750939 the course helped me keep abreast of environment scenario and gave an insight into laws i was not aware of at a higher level studying at this age helps you be more alive and occupied the whole experience of taking notes preparing for the examinations and the investigatory project was thoroughly enjoyable
3750940 i enjoy chanting slokas and wanted to learn sanskrit to get pronunciations right and understand the meaning of the mantras better the whole thing was wonderful as i was not looking at marks or rank when i enrolled in fact it was my sanskrit teacher who egged me on to enrol
3750941 a few could discourage you by pointing out to physical ailments general weakness or lack of alertness and speed
3750942 everything is available online these days and you can learn anything at the click of a mouse
3750943 i can find swarams with sahithyams online so it is easy for me to practise veena at home
3750944 learning is a continuous process and age has nothing to do with it
3750945 sacrifice decision accuracy in order to minimize negative emotions even and perhaps especially in consequential decisions
3750946 treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder in post war kosovar adolescents using mind body skills groups a randomized controlled trial
3750947 this study provides scientific evidence for the efficacy of a model taught to almost 3 000 health and mental health professionals and educators worldwide
3750948 this was proof of principle in patients who had failed the standard therapies and had few if any remaining options
3750949 we had encouraging results including several long term survivors in patients with stage iv cancers that had spread to distant sites
3750950 previous studies determined the maximal radiotherapy doses for single organs
3750951 but this technique has not been tested for simultaneous use on multiple organs so we designed a dose escalation trial to determine the optimal dose starting with fairly low levels and increasing the dose in later groups of patients
3750952 we have seen improved response rates with higher radiation doses without an increase in side effects yet
3750953 and several of them remain disease free one of them three years after treatment
3750954 selama ini kita taken for granted kalau proklamasi adalah kemerdekaan padahal ada proses dialektika di balik proses kemerdekaan jika tidak bisa dibayangkan kalau semua pihak kemudian dengan gampang memproklamasikan diri dan menyatakan merdeka

3750962 professional development is important to the growth of our airmen ncos and company grade officers
3750963 i wish we had programs like this available when i was a junior nco this is why im so passionate about the pds program here
3750964 what works at home station doesnt necessarily work in a deployed environment
3750965 the mini professional development seminar is a prime example of how two ncos brainstormed to find a better solution
3750966 it has a lot of good and useful information the last class i went too offered cross training information
3750967 it helped me know where things are at and if i wanted to cross train i know what the process is it helped me a lot
3750968 its great to see healthy discussion about a wide variety of topics airmen get a chance to discuss their views in a controlled but open environment sometimes its hard to allow everyone a chance to chime in
3750969 our office is concerned about people incurring large expenses for data downloads
3750970 its been a concern of ours for some time in a sense the iphone is the latest in a series of 3g capable handsets which people are able to download data on and our office has seen many complaints where consumers have incurred unexpectedly high bills as a result of the data they have downloaded
3750971 you can download so much data so quickly at considerable cost if you are not on the right plan
3750972 there is no doubt that people are still getting to grips with that
3750973 people have already got their first pro rata iphone bills and many of them are shocked according to reports on iphone forums particularly those on the lower volume plans
3750974 grand statues and parks are wonderful but parks on the other hand bring families together
3750975 when i began the training i couldnt remember appointments where i put things and i had trouble finding the right word
3750976 my attention span was getting longer i could read through entire articles that a couple of weeks ago i couldnt get through knowing that i was exercising my mind and reactivating it was really comforting to me
3750977 while further studies are needed the implications for improved brain health in cancer patients looks promising
3750978 its a practical approach to improving the quality of life in cancer patients because it is non invasive and therefore does not require additional medication or interfere with cancer treatment
3750979 the evidence will show that bill donohue just was not involved in the caretaking of his mother fran even told the police that bill was not involved
3750980 total absolute and complete depravation of what she needed to live

3750987 about a year ago one of my friends asked me if i wanted to do one and i said sure
3750988 i do several sprint sports its a new challenge for me its healthy for me as i always try to stay in good health ive been doing biking swimming running its pretty good on your body and it doesnt beat you up too bad
3750989 ive done five sprint triathlons im training right now for a half ironman triathon on sunday oct 5 in austin texas thats the biggest one ive done so far
3750990 the distance is a huge jump so im approaching it from a standpoint of finishing it not necessarily being very very competitive
3750991 in the sprints i tend to try to be more competitive ive been doing them awhile and im more comfortable with them
3750992 this one is such a long distance the challenge is to get through it from there i dont know what else ill be doing
3750993 i usually spend anywhere from 10 to 14 hours training per week before work or after work
3750994 ill be doing a three and a half hour ride on saturday and a two hour run on sunday
3750995 the sprints dont require as much time thats why it works for me part of they year then occasionally ill do the longer distances then go back to the shorter distances year around i couldnt do that much training time
3750996 my main goal is one of health reason try and promote that for my patients
3750997 were trying to do a little something here in the office to let them know the benefits of exercise and that its something im involved in
3750998 i race every third weekend but youve got to train a little bit you cant just race all the time
3750999 there are other ironmans in the country lake placid had one in july there are a few other ones around the country and theyre extremely hard to get into
3751000 ive thought about it but the commitment but with a family and the practice im not sure i want to make that commitment to do that kind of distance the race is one thing but to get ready for it it takes six to 12 months to get ready for that kind of a race you really have to have your family on board with you maybe in the future i wouldnt rule it out the timing would have to be right
3751001 i have somebody who helps me who is a really good triathlete who gives me a lot of pointers helps me and coaches me she is a nurse at strong
3751002 her life was changed she couldnt go into general practice any more she had to go and find another job
3751003 even if you would like to get 500 kilo can you get them
3751004 i just keep saying to myself greatest olympian of all time over and over

3751006 hes just a normal person although maybe from a different planet a planet from a different galaxy
3751007 my goggles were filling up with water during the race and i had trouble seeing the wall

3751036 the call definitely suits us we hadnt come out of the dressing room at all
3751037 the referee made the right decision not just for us but in the interests of player safety
3751038 there were parts of the game when we were well in the meltingpot it could have gone either way
3751039 our players gave a performance that reflected the work they put in all year full of heart power and commitment
3751040 we had an issue with 3 5 update 2 its actually a licensing problem
3751041 currently what we know is that licensing prevents new virtual machines from powering up after shutdowns and it prevents virtual motioning moving a virtual machine from one host to another
3751042 customers should not stop virtual machines keep virtual machines going until we release a patch

3751066 we gave a good account of ourselves and were competitive throughout the field
3751067 our players gave a performance that reflected the work they put in all year full of heart power and commitment its just unfortunate we met a very good team on the day
3751068 darren going off was a blow to us he is a class act it was unfortunate that he picked up the injury and we had to make a few substitutions as a result
3751069 thats part of sport there were some fine calls but it wasnt the winning or losing of the game i think as the game evolved especially the last ten minutes you could see the stamina strength and power of the tyrone team
3751070 i think that tyrone team is one of the top teams at minor level in the country obviously a huge amount of work went into developing young lads not just this year but for a number of years
3751071 we gave them plenty of it today its a tribute to the lads that for the best part of 55 minutes we kept them on the back foot everyone could see the quality of that tyrone team and we werent outfought or outbattled
3751072 theres 12 of that team still underage next year the experience is bound to stand to them but its the attitude and being prepared to work that matters were fortunate with all the commitment we got from lads this year

3751089 the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc represents the largest existing global effort to answer such technical questions
3751090 global temperatures will rise by about 3 c by the year 2100

3751102 we are hopeful a large number of individuals in our target audiences will avail themselves of these opportunities

3751126 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3751127 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3751128 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3751129 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3751130 the fairness doctrine has not been raised at the fcc but the importance of this election is in part has something to do with that
3751131 so you know this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine there is a discussion of it in congress i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate
3751132 how do you tell her you dont tell her you ask her and you explain what the situation is i was dedicated to that department ive always been dedicated to that department my job my career there have been no tasks not completed that ive been asked to do we sat and spoke about it and came to a conclusion that our relationship is strong enough to be able to handle an undercover operation of what it is it is what it is

3751157 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3751158 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3751159 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3751160 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3751161 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3751162 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3751163 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3751164 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3751165 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3751166 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3751167 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3751168 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3751169 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3751170 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3751171 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3751172 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3751173 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3751174 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3751175 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3751176 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3751177 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3751178 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3751179 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3751180 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
3751181 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3751182 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3751183 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

3751271 with disintegrating family support networks sudden changes in a persons cultural environment homelessness and poverty were more apt to see risk behaviors such as unprotected sex with sex workers other men or sharing injection needles among male migrants
3751272 however an alternate explanation could be that deportation from the united states leads to social upheaval loss of social ties and income factors which lead to engaging in high risk behaviors
3751273 this game will also afford me a chance to see the players in a game situation
3751274 i have only just come into the team and need to understand how each player responds in a game situation
3751275 unlike at club level at national level you dont have the luxury of having your players day in and day out
3751276 we must remain focused that our main objective is to deliver a world class team for the 2010 world cup
3751277 our pyramid scheme which was started by my predecessor carlos parreira and approved by safa must not be dismantled as it is the best model for this country
3751278 we have to merge all the hard work put together in the past 16 months to produce a team for 2010
3751279 the 2010 africa cup of nations qualifiers are therefore important for us just as all the friendly games are
3751280 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3751281 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3751282 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3751283 dammit cant you even wait for us to take off try that again and ill shove a towel down your throat and then pull it back up

3751285 every man woman child stand and be proud we all fall down to pick ourselves from the ground and lose what weve got so its sweeter when its found and round and round and round life goes
3751286 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3751287 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3751288 its exciting to be able to afford our students a new level of service particularly one that encourages patronage of local businesses

3751370 there is potential that this continuing research will have huge clinical implications
3751371 if we can define the mechanism for recovery the translation of these findings to the clinic will dictate how much massage is needed for how long and when it should be performed after exercise
3751372 we tried to mimic swedish massage because anecdotally its the most popular technique used by athletes
3751373 a review of the research in this area shows that despite the existing anecdotal evidence we know athletes use massage all the time researchers dont know the mechanism of how massage improves recovery after exercise and injury
3751374 its hard to describe exactly how the exercise intensity would be matched in a human but this was considered a significant amount of exercise that would likely cause muscle soreness and possible damage
3751375 we know biological tissues are sensitive to the magnitude of frequency duration and load so we controlled the force frequency and time spent on massage
3751376 one fundamental question is how much of a role does inflammation play in repair to a muscle are we preventing inflammation and therefore improving recovery we havent proven that yet
3751377 our goal is to use this model to understand the biological mechanisms of massage as a guide to preclinical trials to test the effects of massage on muscle recovery after exercise
3751378 a trial in humans could look at optimal indications for massage
3751379 ultimately we could also find out how massage helps not just exercise induced muscle injury but swelling and pain associated with other medical conditions as well
3751380 contrary to our predictions based on shorter follow up the absolute difference in cumulative incidence of distant metastasis and prostate cancer death did not further increase after 7 years of follow up
3751381 in settings with a large proportion of psa detected tumors the relative reduction in risk of death following radical prostatectomy might be somewhat larger or similar to that in our study but the absolute reduction would be smaller
3751382 these results demonstrate that among men younger than 65 years whose prostate cancer is detected by methods other than psa testing eg due to a digital rectal examination to evaluate uri nary or other symptoms cure with radical prostatectomy is possi ble may be necessary and should generally be recommended

3751393 this number is an important reminder for physicians and patients that antibiotics can have serious side effects and should only be taken when necessary
3751394 for conditions in which antibiotics have questionable benefit such as many mild upper respiratory tract infections weighing the benefits of antibiotics with the risks of a serious adverse event will be especially important
3751395 because antibiotics are frequently used both appropriately and inappropriately if doctors would reduce the number of antibiotics they prescribe to their patients by even a small percentage we could significantly reduce the number of emergency visits for antibiotic adverse events physicians need to communicate to their patients that antibiotics are not harmless

3751639 pentru ca votul exprimat de camera deputatilor nu este un vot politic si nici unul care sa tina de exercitarea atributiilor legislative pentru a restabili macar la nivel moral locul si rolul puterii jduecatoresti unjr va ataca votul dat asupra responsabilitatii penale a unor deputati considerind acest act ca unul ce nu tine de rolul legislativ al camerei deputatilor
3751640 actiunea noastra are in primul rind un considerent moral pentru ca dorim sa atragem atentia ca un astfel de vot goleste de continut notiunea de reforma in justitie si lupta impotriva coruptiei astfel reforma justitiei devine rizibila pura demagogie ceea ce e grav pentru un stat de drept

3751727 it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
3751728 from now on its just a downward slope the end is close i love it
3751729 it is bound to be the case there will be a quarter or two of negative growth
3751730 the committees forecasts for gdp growth now envisage the economy broadly stagnating over the next year or so
3751731 however there is a clear chance that the economy slows even more sharply than this business surveys are already warning of the danger that the economy actually contracts in the second half of the year
3751732 the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment to higher energy and commodity prices and in banking credit and housing markets
3751733 this adjustment to our economy cannot be avoided and as a result inflation is rising and growth is slowing
3751734 while we would not rule out a cut in british rates in november particularly if the economy slows markedly further and oil prices continue to retreat we are maintaining our view that interest rates will stay at 5 00 percent until early 2009
3751735 however we then expect interest rates to come down markedly in 2009 to 4 25 percent by mid 2009 and to 3 75 percent by the fourth quarter of next year
3751736 was undertaken so as to extend the maturity profile of crowns debt finance portfolio
3751737 we chose this theme because we firmly believe we are significantly repositioning the group in each segment of our business
3751738 in these volatile times the group offers a combination of strengths which mean we are well placed to navigate these difficult market conditions
3751739 we have a very strong capital base the strongest in the industry strong liquidity a firm aa credit rating and a globally respected funding team conservative risk management practices a strong domestic banking franchise
3751740 as wells fargo chief executive john stumpf said earlier this year its interesting that the industry has continued to invent new ways to lose money when the old ways seemed to work just fine
3751741 the deadline will not work but government will be happy if progress is being made in these regard
3751742 rest assured that the board is very mindful of treating our shareholders well whether it be through share price appreciation or dividends
3751743 clearly we are entering an economic period which may be challenging we think we can withstand the headwinds that are there but at the same time we are not going to be overly optimistic
3751744 not in the interests of maximising the long term value of the fund
3751745 all through the second half one month was better then weaker then stronger i just think the pattern is quite irregular at the moment reflecting the confidence levels of the consumer
3751746 everyone stayed at home i havent seen that since early 2000s and early 1990s
3751747 i think people were so anxious there was no level of confidence in june whatsoever
3751748 if you buy something you want to make sure that its going to last
3751749 we are finding we are having less difficulty selling our highest priced items in store than our lower priced items
3751750 customers are buying items they know can mix and match thats where you do get your basics being bought they want good quality basics
3751751 the clear synergies between the computershare and busy bees businesses make this a very exciting acquisition for us
3751752 it continues our strategy of building on our existing capacities to deliver enhanced services to clients
3751753 the sale price reflects the strong growth of the voucher business since our 2006 acquisition and will be a positive outcome for shareholders
3751754 we cannot forecast a regulators actions you dont have a dialogue with them beforehand to some degree its a risk and we are making our shareholders fully aware of that
3751755 it will provide csl with the additional scale breadth of products geographical presence low cost base and capacity to increase output to enhance our position in the us15 billion 17 billion global plasma products market
3751756 sentiment in the aussie of course has been very weak for the last two weeks since the reserve bank of australia suggested they are likely to shift to cutting interest rates
3751757 im actually still very nervous because of the fact that at the end of the day the market is still quite long in the aussie meaning many traders were holding it and the question is are there a lot more accounts that need to offload it
3751758 theyve been highly exposed to the aussie and kiwi over the last two months
3751759 its true there has been an impact from consumer caution which has been reflected in the growth rate
3751760 certainly there has been some subduing impact over the course of the last few months but i think were through the worst of that were fairly cautiously optimistic about our ability to continue to grow
3751761 pay tv is probably not one of the things that people get rid of in a slowing environment
3751762 underlying demand is determined by factors such as net immigration levels birth rates etc and remains strong
3751763 trading in the other states was reasonable but in nsw where there is at least 200 000 of embedded taxes such as stamp duty and other tax charges in a 500 000 house as well as high interest rates no one can afford to buy so the market grinds to a halt
3751764 there is ample supply of stock and customers are interested but buyers cant commit as they cant sell their own house what nsw needs is a catalyst either from a fall in interest rates or a reduction in stamp duty and other taxes
3751765 v australia is not a huge legacy carrier with a massive network we make the time and effort to focus on our guests
3751766 while at the brand and persona front we are by nature cavalier no one should be fooled about the seriousness of our intent

3751774 im just trying to get through everything its a lot of racing and its not easy
3751775 i am trying to take one race at a time
3751776 this is a once in a lifetime chance to do something decent and convincingly engage the right part of the market first
3751777 we think the endorsement cycle for us is broken among specifiers designers and architects
3751778 we are already in the kitchen with our dishwashers and fridges and most people regard us highly for washing machines and dryers but when it come to the truly emotional purchase which is the oven and cooktop our brand stops dead
3751779 the future is where you dont even see the appliances although there are issues for marketers like us because you lose your branding opportunity
3751780 we came to the conclusion on tuesday that given where markets are it would not be prudent to go ahead with the due diligence
3751781 thats amazing in a marketplace where competition is at its greatest and commodity inflation is growing
3751782 i believe in time therell be a shift back to the heartland there are a lot of macro trends around going back to the simple things in life and i think that will be a big driver in consumer purchasing behaviour
3751783 its not as if weve been tricking up a scotch finger
3751784 the fact those consumers are responding to this is an indication that a number of people want to get back to basics
3751785 we are not a national brand we are fabric of the nation brand
3751786 marketers talk about being the owners of the brand but at arnotts we believe australians own the brand we dont like to interfere with that relationship
3751787 marketers can sometimes get ahead of themselves about the role that brands play in peoples lives
3751788 i think we can do that through market incentives and through ways we can work with businesses so they can pull businesses together to come up with cheaper health care costs with cheaper insurance for employees and thats what we ultimately want more people covered under heath insurance

3751830 auf diese weise werden kinder kontinuierlich und spielerisch an informationen rund um die zahngesundheit herangef hrt so soll die postmappe den kindern zum einen dabei helfen wichtige informationen f r die eltern gesch tzt im schulranzen nach hause zu bringen zum anderen erhalten eltern und kinder auf diese weise vielf ltige ideen f r ein gesundes schulfr hst ck und tipps zur zahnpflege

3752074 all participants were given a conventional western diet with defined fat and daily intake of olive corn oil mix for six weeks for the next eight weeks participants were placed on a high omega 3 content fish diet with additional supplementation of fish oil high in omega 3 polyunsaturated fat this study had administered the highest known level of omega 3 than previous studies during the last week membrane fatty acids were measured on each diet insulin sensitivity was also assessed the results showed that in a diet with a high intake of omega 3 triglycerides were reduced in women and free fatty acids were reduced in men serum c reactive protein was also reduced with a high omega 3 diet no changes were found in metabolic parameters or hormone responses

3752081 the russians have committed clear incursions onto core georgian territories the images are reminiscent of chechnya
3752082 important not to debate responsibility at this point all arguments are for the closest possible cooperation with russia rather than a standoff and the most important thing now is for the americans to somewhat restrain their anti russian reflexes
3752083 cant support saakashvilis policies but on the other hand it cant accept russias power politics against its smaller neighbor
3752084 only if it is possible to develop the relationship with russia towards a genuine partnership based on common principles will it become possible to perhaps solve these regional conflicts some day
3752085 i have nothing against the georgians on the contrary but nobody can seriously be interested in countries becoming members of nato which could start a conflict with a nuclear power any week
3752086 russia is waging war against a neighboring country it must be made clear to russia that its endeavors to present itself as a responsible and indispensable international actor are endangered by these actions
3752087 the attempt by the georgian president blind to reality and megalomaniac to solve the conflict militarily and to drag it onto the international stage during the bush presidency has failed miserably meanwhile russia the enraged major power is showing that where its own interests are concerned it is not much concerned with international law and public sympathies
3752088 the cautious europeans were right to be reserved the eu must use its neutral role to mediate
3752089 russia provoked this war realpolitik requires that the west must at first accept this act of aggression but it also demands sharper answers to this new russian revisionism

3752123 ive never paid a dime of money to any of the people that are involved ive never asked anybody to pay a dime of money never been told that any moneys been paid
3752124 we dont know that they were illegal if they were contributions from the campaign then obviously theres some issues there with legality but at this point were still trying to investigate that
3752125 and if you take that money that people have contributed to you based upon the fact that they think their money is going to a presidential candidate and you give it to a girlfriend of a god knows what thats a crime but the question is how do you prove that and she was somehow working for the campaign as its videographer so was the money she got so inappropriately more than what she deserved thats going to be the issue the feds are going to have to look at it would be a federal offense
3752126 this was merely an attempt to bring qualified candidates to the attention of the jncs

3752186 about a year ago one of my friends asked me if i wanted to do one and i said sure
3752187 i do several sprint sports its a new challenge for me its healthy for me as i always try to stay in good health ive been doing biking swimming running its pretty good on your body and it doesnt beat you up too bad
3752188 ive done five sprint triathlons im training right now for a half ironman triathon on sunday oct 5 in austin texas thats the biggest one ive done so far
3752189 the distance is a huge jump so im approaching it from a standpoint of finishing it not necessarily being very very competitive
3752190 in the sprints i tend to try to be more competitive ive been doing them awhile and im more comfortable with them
3752191 this one is such a long distance the challenge is to get through it from there i dont know what else ill be doing
3752192 i usually spend anywhere from 10 to 14 hours training per week before work or after work
3752193 ill be doing a three and a half hour ride on saturday and a two hour run on sunday
3752194 the sprints dont require as much time thats why it works for me part of they year then occasionally ill do the longer distances then go back to the shorter distances year around i couldnt do that much training time
3752195 my main goal is one of health reason try and promote that for my patients
3752196 were trying to do a little something here in the office to let them know the benefits of exercise and that its something im involved in

3752198 there are other ironmans in the country lake placid had one in july there are a few other ones around the country and theyre extremely hard to get into
3752199 ive thought about it but the commitment but with a family and the practice im not sure i want to make that commitment to do that kind of distance the race is one thing but to get ready for it it takes six to 12 months to get ready for that kind of a race you really have to have your family on board with you maybe in the future i wouldnt rule it out the timing would have to be right

3752316 we must encourage world leaders to make their ethnic minorities equal partners in government rather than backing rebels who would carve out states within states like a succession of russian dolls in the long run americas current inconsistency jeopardizes the possibility of ethnic pluralism becoming a universal ideal and a workable solution for multiethnic societies when minorities see independence on the horizon their incentives for peaceful coexistence rapidly diminish

3752343 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3752344 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3752345 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3752346 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3752347 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3752348 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve

3752355 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3752356 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3752357 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3752358 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3752359 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3752360 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3752361 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3752362 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3752363 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3752364 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3752365 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3752366 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3752367 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3752368 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3752369 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3752370 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3752371 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3752372 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3752373 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3752374 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3752375 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3752376 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3752377 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3752378 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3752379 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3752380 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3752381 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3752382 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3752383 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3752384 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3752385 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3752386 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3752387 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3752388 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3752389 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3752390 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3752391 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3752392 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

3752395 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3752396 when i was unveiled i said i was not counting on him but i also said we would treat him as any other player my job is to get a good performance from the players which the club makes available to me
3752397 during the past two three weeks the past month that we have been together i have been very pleased with his performance not only on the pitch but in terms of his relationship with his teammates i only have words of praise
3752398 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3752399 what have i got to lose except 6 stamps and 6 00 right
3752400 we were inspired by the response and the number of submissions
3752401 the dedication and the quality of work exceeded our expectations in our little experiment hopefully this will be a catalyst in even bolder ideas of remixing movies music and culture
3752402 i wanted the trailer to feel like there were many layers
3752403 many different trailers lurking under the surface of this one that there is an alternate trailer if you just flipped one over
3752404 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3752405 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3752406 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3752407 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3752408 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3752409 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3752410 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3752411 who are open to doing something on the production side
3752412 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3752413 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3752414 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3752415 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3752416 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3752417 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3752418 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3752419 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3752420 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3752421 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3752422 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3752423 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3752424 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3752425 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3752426 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3752427 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3752428 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3752429 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3752430 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3752431 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3752432 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3752433 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3752436 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3752437 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3752438 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3752439 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3752440 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3752441 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3752442 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3752443 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3752444 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3752445 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3752446 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3752447 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3752448 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

3752473 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3752474 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3752475 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3752476 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3752481 oh theyre pushy creatures alright you should see what goes on under the surface in the root systems farmers and gardeners have every right idea about them selfish bastards all of them its like their roots act like magnets or something so dont let me stop you please carry on by all means you just looked particularly intense in doing it thats all
3752482 i do im sorry i mean yes i suppose i am a bit single minded today sometimes weeds are a chore and the only way through it is just to get down there and get to work
3752483 some of these vegetable are nearing the end of the line i guess
3752484 well as a matter of fact youre exactly right pretty soon these tomatoes will have run their course and i put the carrots in early enough so that i could really start pulling them any time now of course the lettuce is all eaten up
3752485 well i cant say it isnt something that hasnt occurred to me i have to tell you i have no idea ive never done this before
3752486 you see thats what im talking about you sitting there suggesting strawberries in next years garden even though i cant for the life of me determine where you even get the knowledge that there are such things and then you look at me as bold as you please and tell me you have no idea what happens to you come this fall you talk to me about things you could never have experienced as if its stuff youve known about for years and years naming things correctly as nice as you please and you swear like a sailor and put sentences together that are intelligent and understandable even though youre only a couple months in this world and then you tell me you dont know what your fate is im sorry i am just having a very difficult time processing this whole thing right now
3752487 just for the record i cant understand how i know things either i just seem to know them not sure how that works this is all new to me too so that you know all i know is here i am im completely here in the present and i dont question what i know any more than i have a desire to claim to know things i dont know i know a lot about things but i dont know whats to become of me do you
3752488 do you know how your life is going to end do you know what happens after you die
3752489 well im pretty sure its a heaven or hell thing isnt it
3752490 who knows i mean it who actually knows its a pleasant guess it could be so it be not so it could be something no one had ever thought of it could be anything or it could be nothing but nobody actually knows not really not until it happens and theres no going back right
3752491 ok i can see that sure we have an idea but its a matter of faith sure
3752492 yet you know theres other people in the world thousands of miles away going along with their lives even though youve never seen them right
3752493 so its the same with me i dont know how i know things but i know them i dont ask why or how but as to what happens at the end of my time i can only guess just like you
3752494 yes but i know things because of experience ive read about things or ive gone to school and learned about them where do you get your experience from
3752495 see i dont ask that question you telling me how youve learned things is a place where i dont go its not an easy concept i know but i just dont go there i know what i know i dont know how i know it but i also know that there are things i dont know about how is it you never ask how i know that
3752496 its hard for me to say i dont know how to answer your question i just am i dont know where i came from or how i got in this form and i have no idea what lies in the future for me im just here i exist thats all i can honestly say is true so why worry about it
3752497 lots of people struggle with where they came from and where theyre going i mean in the human world theres whole industries built around helping people answer those kinds of questions
3752498 lots of different reasons i suppose everybodys motivation is probably different
3752499 well i dont get it what would be different if everybody knew what life was all about i mean you say all these people humans are going around trying to find out where they came from and where theyre going and if they found out what would change really
3752500 im not sure but i think there would maybe be less strife between people
3752501 im just guessing but it seems to me that if the whole story of what were doing here and what it all means ever becomes known i guess people would be happy a lot of questions would be answered for a lot of people and maybe everybody would calm down i really dont know
3752502 whatever you say you know more about your kind than i do thats for sure its not for me i just am i guess
3752503 well its like for instance do you have any memories
3752504 i seem to remember a feeling like i was in a cold dark place and stuff was crawling on me but i wasnt really uncomfortable or anything seemed natural actually but its just a fuzzy kind of memory nothing i can be sure about i dont think i have a visual memory of it or anything outside of that not much first thing i remember seeing was that green tomato over there on the bottom branch of that tomato plant
3752505 i just dont understand this at all something tells me im like dreaming or something because this just doesnt happen
3752506 look i promise you im here i really am here alright weve kind of been through this already you know i mean we can go over it again if you want
3752507 i mean it must be very hot in the sunshine with a beard and all
3752508 im fine a beards a beard what else are you supposed to do with it
3752509 i know lots of guys who trim it in the summer to keep themselves cool in the heat
3752510 um i dont think that would be a good idea
3752511 would you cut the leaves off these tomato plants because it was too warm
3752512 ow you bastard get off of ow get away get a ow
3752513 well let me look at it you fool maybe i can help get back here and let me see
3752514 looks like he just got one jab in and thats all youre bleeding really just from a little peck because its your eye it makes it seem bad is all
3752515 well what are we going to do here the damn thing hurts you have any ideas
3752516 im going to rinse it then im going to put a patch on it with a little pressure so that the bleeding stops well keep it patched for a couple days and see how it is after that ok
3752517 you just hold on right there and ill be right back
3752518 get out of here damn ow bastard you little bastard ow get the ow
3752519 no i saw him coming this time he got my nose a bit when i turned away just in time but i dont care about that
3752520 theres just a little mark there he didnt even break the skin
3752521 oh youll have a mark there alright but thats about it
3752522 i dont know were going to have to make sure this doesnt happen anymore i cant be here twenty four seven watching for that damn crow were going to have to think of something
3752523 i tried to catch him in my mouth just then and bite his damn head off thats how he got my nose id like to kill the son of a bitch
3752524 come over here you bastard come over here and let me bite your wings off you feathered little piece of crap
3752525 yeah shut up you son of a bitch ill bite your damn head off
3752526 im going to have to put you under a basket im afraid
3752527 i mean a wire basket not a solid one i cant sit here all day and all night just because he got a taste of your eye and found he likes it
3752528 i heard the way you said that all day and all night like im some kind of helpless little kid one split second more and i would have chomped that crows head off and all my troubles would have been over you know
3752529 im certain of it i agree im not laughing at you honest
3752530 but im still going to have to get a cover for you because i mean what if he comes back at night and you dont see him in the dark until its too late he looks pretty crafty to me
3752531 im not saying thats not a good idea i just dont want you thinking im helpless down here lifes a lot tougher down here than i think you give me credit for im not a rookie over here you know im adapted to this i was born to it
3752532 let me just get my stuff and well get you all set up
3752533 ill bet you that crow is watching us right now
3752534 i bet hes watching what youre doing and just working over whats going on i can feel it
3752535 he wont be able to figure this out and ill tell you another thing im going to make it so that it will stick into the ground and ill set some rocks around a flattened edge so that he wont be able to get it off of you just in case
3752536 well actually im kind of thinking of having it there whenever im in a different part of the yard
3752537 i mean its a good idea and all but im in like jail now
3752538 what else can i do when im doing something in another part of the yard ive got to cut grass in a day or so what are you going to do when im in the front of the house
3752539 there is a performance difference between fcp 5 0 project files and 5 1 5 0 was a powerpc based app and 5 1 was a cross grade universal binary ub means just that it works on both ppc and intel ppc apps run through rosetta on intel machines and leopard and not very good in terms of pro apps the general consensus is dont run fcp 5 on any intel machine if you can avoid it
3752540 the issue is not so much the ability to open the application and the performance but opening those project files also trying to carry over older project version render files is a bad idea re rendering is a time issue but less painful
3752541 this week we bring you 19 year old wilder he straight from miami and enjoys working out and showing off its summer so you know that you can find him on the beach wearing almost
3752542 sure its my garden but i didnt set it up so youd show up i have no idea where you came from for all i know youre just a guy who showed up one day and buried himself up to the neck in my garden if you think that means im going to take care of you you need to think again im a libertarian
3752543 dont look at me youre just there there you are and i didnt put you there you put yourself there
3752544 i didnt put myself here i just grew here i woke up this morning and here i am i dont have any control over where i am im just here
3752545 you mean to tell me that youre just a head that popped out of the ground this morning and here you are speaking english with me and im supposed to believe that is that what youre telling me
3752546 well as improbable as that sounds thats obviously what the case is dont you think
3752547 like i said for all i know youre just some guy pulling a prank who buried himself in my garden up to the neck and now youre messing with my head theres no rule saying ive got to believe anything you tell me
3752548 well ill say this then go ahead and dig the dirt around my neck and see whats under the ground go ahead if theres arms and legs and everything else down there ill just get up and go and youll never see me again
3752549 no im not falling for this craziness you understand thats all i need the neighbors to see me digging in the dirt around a talking head with a black moustache ill be the laughing stock the minute i get down in there and see a shirt you know the joke is over
3752550 right look im making myself a sandwich im taking this lettuce inside and im putting it on a bun with my salami and ham and cheese and im going to eat it and my suggestion to you is by the time i come out here again probably tomorrow morning to water the garden id be gone and on my way anyway thats what i would do if i were you because ill tell you right now im not going to put up with this prank for too long funs fun but if youre not out of here by the morning im calling the police and then well see whats what
3752551 im telling you i cant i dont have any arms and legs like you i just grew here is all wait come back
3752552 i was buried in a garden just like you are except i was only buried up to my waist and i could still move my arms in fact i was nice and warm in a blanket
3752553 well lucky you im just a head coming out of the ground talking to you and you didnt believe me yesterday but here i am still so now what are you going to do
3752554 you know there was a skunk went through here late last night and it gets cold just on top of black dirt like this theres a kind of soupy dew that just hangs there at the base of all the plants in here youve probably never noticed it before
3752555 so i ask you if im not what i say i am i mean if im some prank what am i doing still here totally familiar with what night is like in your garden
3752556 well wait just a minute anybody can make up anything about what happens in a garden over night i mean you could just assume things that happen in a garden at night and a person probably wouldnt be too far off i mean come on skunks and dew anybody can come up with that
3752557 nevertheless theres nothing i can do to prove to you there was a skunk in here last night but rub the hair on top of my head and see for yourself about the dew
3752558 no theres no way im rubbing your head no in fact ive got to water the vegetables now and what the hell am i supposed to do with you in there like that
3752559 well i am feeling a bit thirsty just water all around me and try not to get anything on my hair i have a feeling im susceptible to morning rot if i get too wet in the cool air plus i dont want to attract leaf miners
3752560 i dont ever use harsh chemicals to keep the bugs down i just usually use soap and water do you mind
3752561 it should be ok just give me some fair warning ok i mean just let me know its coming
3752562 oh no problem probably just before noon before it gets hot
3752563 no this isnt just for me because people actually like read it and so you should think about that when you write something
3752564 if you have no idea what this is about can i come over to your place please

3752584 we in the past have written to the chief of staff that no government facility should be allowed at any party function and it has been our guiding principle and we abide by it
3752585 but as we all know the only person who is covered is the president who is covered by law but that aside i can assure the people of ghana that there would not be abuse of incumbency
3752586 therefore proceedings would be paid for and carried live on national television where the party will account to the people of ghana
3752587 the best form of co operation that the ec needs now is that with the political parties to produce a clean election and you cannot achieve that by making power the centre of argument between you and the parties

3752662 rusia poate sa considere ca este in favoarea ei sa intensifice tensiunile cu ucraina inainte de analiza din decembrie a nato
3752663 daca acest conflict cu rusia incetineste sau chiar impiedica integrarea georgiei in occident o soarta similara ar putea avea si ucraina
3752664 moscova ar putea interveni sa protejeze presupusele interese ale populatiei ruse care s ar simti astfel amenintata
3752665 daca va reactiona prea violent impotriva ucrainei atunci risca sa provoace reactia pe care si o doreste cel mai putin se vor ridica bariere privind comertul si investitiile in fata companiilor sale se va confrunta cu o abordare mai antagonica a tranzitului energiei si mai mult risca sa sperie ucraina si sa o determine sa caute protectia occidentala
3752666 contracareze presiunile pe care rusia le pune asupra statelor vecine mai ales asupra ucrainei cel mai probabil noua tinta a eforturilor moscovei de a crea o noua sfera de hegemonie statele unite si uniunea europeana trebuie sa fie foarte clare n r in dialogul cu rusia pentru ca ucraina si georgia sa nu fie condamnate sa ramana intr o zona gri

3752668 gt buffalo bills fullback darian barnes right fights through the block of steve johnson during a special teams drill at training camp at st john fisher college
3752669 its going good i feel like i have a good grasp of the offense
3752670 i am jelling with the line and with the other backs
3752671 darian has done a really nice job through otas offseason training activities and into training camp
3752672 he is very physical and has good size he understands the position and understands what we want from him he has experience playing fullback so he becomes a very valuable guy in our offense
3752673 i think it helps our run game a lot actually
3752674 with darian barnes and jonathan evans in front picking up the linebackers blitzing through the gap i think this fits turks schonert offensive style a little bit better
3752675 the only thing i really remember was the game it was great because i got a chance to block for mike alstott that was really exciting and it was one of the greatest experiences of my life much less my career
3752676 the league is very tough kind of a gritty place to play
3752677 playing that level of college football is hard when i got there i got to see how aggressive i really was after playing the position for a while it became natural and i fell into it

3752720 its unfair that people keep saying the chinese are too young to compete
3752721 if they think they can tell someones age just by looking at them well if you look at the foreign athletes they have so much more muscles than the chinese they are so strong do you then say that they are doping

3752734 it was a perfect day i did everything for this day
3752735 to be the favorite and to be still the first afterwards thats a hard thing because you have a lot of pressure it was a really really tough race and now its a moment to enjoy and to be happy and proud that i am winning
3752736 i hoped for a race like this i knew the course suited me well i rode the race of a lifetime but he is strong
3752737 i gave it everything i had in the last bit and pushed myself very hard and it paid off and im very happy

3752743 i would stop by the table where the kitchen maid had shelled them to inspect the platoons of peas drawn up in ranks and numbered like little green marbles ready for a game but what most enraptured me were the asparagus tinged with ultramarine and pink which shaded off from their heads finely stippled in mauve and azure through a series of imperceptible gradations to their white feet still stained a little by the soil of their garden bed with an iridescence that was not of this world
3752744 it has been proven over the last 40 years that the ibm mainframe is the core of the enterprise data center universe and a technology that is never going to go away
3752745 we have been educating and training our students for careers by using a technology platform that we believe in and organizations like tsys see it as the foundation for their own data centers were pleased to play a role in this collaborative partnership
3752746 our knowledgeable consultative team members are the lifeblood of our company and we continually need to add the best programmers in the world to maintain update and program our ibm mainframes with the latest technology and software to enable constant reliability and availability to our customers
3752747 our relationship with columbus state university and ibm provides us the strategic insight and access to some of the best mainframe and large enterprise computing skills in the world and were looking forward to continually employing new generations of mainframe programmers
3752748 organizations that own zseries platforms should make an investment of time and involvement in programs to ensure a steady supply of candidates with the right mix of skills
3752749 even if cios face no current shortage of mainframe resources realize that the laws of supply and demand cut both ways increased competition for talented mainframe resources is likely to become a catalyst for staff attrition in the coming years
3752750 the ibm mainframe is the foundation for the data center today a proven technology platform that clients are betting their entire infrastructures on
3752751 the students of today are going to be responsible for the future operations of the mainframe and it is thanks to key schools like columbus state university that students are learning a wide range of mainframe skills and gaining hands on experience to apply at those very companies that need the skill sets like tsys the success of ibm tsys and columbus state is the very essence of our academic initiative for system z program
3752752 academic programs are beginning to offset anticipated mainframe talent shortages
3752753 this is something the average person can get their hands on and do
3752754 participants will get to see what can happen in a year and five years
3752755 its like an adrenaline shot and they feel like we can do this

3752759 6 43 would have instantaneously brought a verse to mind from memory but having only google heres the verse i trust god was revealing no good tree bears bad fruit nor does a bad tree bear good fruit each tree is recognized by its own fruit people do not pick figs from thornbushes or grapes from briers the good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart for out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks luke 6 43 45 i feel like i hope thats god revealing to me what hes doing in my life right now as everything is in the midst of change that its all good fruit then yesterday on my lunch break i read the next few verses of that chapter i will show you what he is like who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice he is like a man building a house who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock when a flood came the torrent struck that house but could not shake it because it was well built but the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation the moment the torrent struck that house it collapsed and its destruction was complete
3752760 it is perhaps the last great journey of exploration on the planet
3752761 it was a journey that left presenter explorer kate humble and deep sea cameraman mike degruy literally breathless with awe
3752762 we were pushing the boundaries spending extra long periods as a visitor in an alien element
3752763 im not a brave person and i was nervous because every dive has its risks
3752764 on a dive called the peleliu express i had to hook myself to the reef while huge shoals of fish and even large sharks were swept past me by the fantastically powerful current i clung on for grim death as a cameraman went tumbling by
3752765 it was a true voyage of discovery most of the sites we explored had never been dived before the expedition undertook some of the deepest and most dangerous diving ever attempted by a tv crew but one of the most awe inspiring sights was the graveyard of the japanese fleet there were just so many ghosts down there
3752766 weve found that octopuses effectively have six arms and two legs
3752767 it had been thought they used four tentacles for movement and the other four for feeding and manipulating objects but observations showed that they use the rearmost two to get around over rocks and the seabed they also use these two legs to push off when they wish to swim and then other tentacles are used to propel them
3752768 capturing the spirit of an era is american journalisms holy grail as elusive as it is pursued what makes the great decade capturing books great isnt so much the originality of their themes michael lewis wasnt the only guy to write about rapacious 80s bond traders but the delicious precision of their details take the beginning of tom wolfes radical chic in which wolfe savors the little roquefort cheese morsels rolled in crushed nuts leonard bernstein served to real black panthers at a fund raiser in his apartment its a moment so keenly observed so wicked so right that it reveals more about the late 60s style of self congratulatory slumming than any sweeping pronouncement could have this kind of texture is whats missing from barbara ehrenreichs new book this land is their land a collection of short opinion pieces for the new yorktimes the nation and elsewhere repackaged as a bid to define the bush years america in the aughts as the jacket copy puts it
3752769 ehrenreich offers what read now as obsolete explanations for their behavior
3752770 itwould have been more fun to watch her riff on the bush eras barbecue fueled quest for culinary authenticity than on the food fads of the 80s and 90s
3752771 ehrenreich is at her best and shes very very good when chronicling the outrageous human downside of our economy the costs it imposes on people who cant afford a bacon infused old fashioned theres the hospital worker whose employer garnished her paycheck for anemergency room visit a condition of debt servitude reminiscent of early 20th century company towns theres the poor man who got himself arrested in order to live more comfortably in prison because we are reaching the point where the largest public housing program in america will be our penitentiary system remove the less than trenchant lifestyle and culture essays and youve got a tight and chilling companion volume to nickel anddimed ehrenreichs account of her own experience working undercover in the low wage economy
3752772 surely someone of ehrenreichs political persuasion could have found more time to skewer the things i really associate with the bush era iraq the lobbying scandals reality tv blackberrys
3752773 time to skewer the things that eve fairbanks associates with the bush era
3752774 the court is profoundly concerned about the very poor judgment which this childs parents have shown in choosing this name
3752775 it makes a fool of the child and sets her up with a social disability and handicap unnecessarily
3752776 life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all
3752777 they did not challenge it very much and it therefore turned out to be quite a simple fraud to conduct

3752779 the study of marine mammal acoustics and behavior is an area of emerging interest for many reasons but there have been many recent advances including this recently completed study
3752780 we were fortunate to have some of the best scientists in these fields working with noaa on this pilot project it will take some time to analyze the data and see what conclusions may be drawn but in many ways this effort lays the foundation for more sophisticated collaborative efforts in the future
3752781 this is a major issue for the global economy and jobs related to oil and gas alternative energy and even nuclear are likely to see strong growth
3752782 if you have a strong knowledge of other cultures and an ability to work in another country youll find plenty of opportunities
3752783 if youre first generation chinese with business skills and chinese language skills youre in good shape
3752784 not only will professionals with skills in sustainability issues be in demand through the end of the decade we are likely to shortages of professionals with green skills
3752785 crime doesnt stop during a recession and police officers port security specialists and international security experts will continue to be in demand

3752816 thats the last time i ever direct a movie for the wife
3752817 the worst thing we can do as a nation is taking the easy way out
3752818 the coast of south carolina is a cash cow out there in american controlled waters is a lot of oil and gas so lets go get it
3752819 the volume of oil spilled and impacts to shore from the offshore infrastructure were categorized as minor
3752820 onshore impacts from localized tank failures resulting from flooding were more significant
3752821 you cant get around running right through some type of habitat to accomplish this so you end up having some type of impact as youre coming up and making landfall
3752822 in our area as sensitive as estuarian habitats are thats an area of concern
3752823 direct mortality and displacement of any of the species there
3752824 one of the most extensive untouched deep water coral habitats in the world
3752825 the geology of north america is really well known so we know where the potential areas of gas and oil are
3752826 south carolina isnt one of those places after you start looking at the numbers the whole argument about exploration becomes extremely bogus
3752827 oil companies do not chase ghosts it costs too much when nothing is there
3752828 oil exploration is a science and if the geology looked good then there would have been seismic ships off our coast looking for oil and oil companies wanting to explore their absence from the area says it all there is no oil
3752829 if more federal acreage was made available under prudent environmental standards conocophillips would likely invest even greater amounts in the search for oil and natural gas in the u s
3752830 all i know is whenever i watch discovery is they say off the coast of south carolina i dont know how far out theres millions of barrels of oil
3752831 the geologists could be environmentalists they might have been born again as far as being greenpeace advocates
3752832 while the other members of the general assembly are doing their jet skiing and polo and horseback riding and whatever theyre doing during the summer months
3752833 all i know is if theres oil out there we want to find it and if we find it were going to drill for it and if we drill for it were going to make it right for everybody
3752834 the bottom line is weve got to be free of these third world countries dictating policy and making our lives miserable any time that they can because theyve got the power over our oil
3752835 threatens our coast our economy and our jobs while not doing one single thing to lower gas prices
3752836 even if increased domestic drilling activity could affect the price of gasoline there is yet no justification to open additional federal lands because oil and gas companies have shown that they cannot keep pace with the rate of drilling permits that the federal government is handing out
3752837 the fact is that the nation simply cannot drill its way to lower prices at the pump
3752838 oil and gas companies would not buy leases to this land without believing oil and gas can be produced there
3752839 weve gone after our easy to get cheap oil and what were left with are reserves that require more energy and money to extract theyre waiting on gas prices to get to a point where it makes it economically viable to pump it out of the ground
3752840 until we have five six or seven dollar gasoline it doesnt make sense theyre simply taking advantage of the fact that weve got 4 gasoline and were in an election year to try and get this moratorium lifted so they can put these leases on the books and theyre reflected on wall street that they have these reserves under their control

3752873 the russians want to assert themselves in ex soviet space thats not acceptable these are individual sovereign countries with territorial integrity of their own
3752874 a reversion not just to cold war politics but to 19th century politics
3752875 the g7 has shown its willingness to work without russia
3752876 thats quite unprecedented since the start of the g8 i think that makes very clear to russia the political consequences of their actions
3752877 russia do have rights but they must be combined with responsibilities there will be political consequences if they do not uphold them
3752878 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people rightly

3752899 a focused consolidated review strengthens our ability to prevent anyone from profiting from insider information
3752900 while u s equity markets have always coordinated very well with each other to detect and investigate insider trading this agreement takes insider trading surveillance to a new level because it consolidates within finra and nyse regulation what used to be eleven discreet programs at each market center
3752901 as a result potential insider traders whether acting alone or in concert with others and regardless of where they trade in the will be more readily identified in this new more unified structure

3752910 the peace process was aimed at fulfilling the resolutions of the united nations and the terms of the road map which call for the establishment of a palestinian state on the 1967 borders with jerusalem as its capital and which does not have any settlements in it
3752911 inmate sterner made comments such as make me stand and do your job
3752912 corporal williams testified she did not construe the incident involving inmate sterner as a use of force stating i didnt know it was force because i didnt know he could not stand
3752913 as a result of corporal williamss inaction the hillsborough county sheriffs office was adversely impacted on a national level
3752914 none of the deputies intervened and or assisted inmate sterner in any way documented the incident or brought the actions of deputy marshall jones to the attention of a supervisor or higher authority
3752915 to me the incident was not as important as it has grown to be

3752923 roger is the uncommon combination of scholar and artist whose scholarly work informs his performance and whose performance informs his scholarship
3752924 both his professional and collegiate based theater productions have been praised for their conceptual originality and inventive multimedia staging he is an inspiring teacher whose courses appeal to a broad range of students and he has given long thought to the role of theater and dance in a liberal arts curriculum
3752925 i started to realize it was all wrapped up together
3752926 i found a real symbiosis between my writing and my art
3752927 i think we tend to make a common mistake that intellectual work is not emotional but for me the most important thing that scholarship does is to fuel my imagination

3752942 not only is it outrageous but i would challenge the fact that theyre causing citizens to become entrapped in committing federal crimes we now have a city that legislates to home depot or whatever home building company wants to build that they actually harbor and shelter illegal aliens aiding and abet them to stay here and to help find them employment

3752956 the last time it was this bad was before my time i started in the early 1990s and i imagine that in edinburgh probably the last time it was as bad as this was before that
3752957 its difficult to predict whats going to happen im not expecting very much to happen this year and i imagine that we could be looking into some time next year before we get back to normality
3752958 even then were not going to see these premium edinburgh prices
3752959 borrowing is a problem and first time buyers are finding it difficult theyre having to find bigger deposits and dont have resources and the investors are disappearing
3752960 we normally see the same developers noting interest in doer uppers and recently theyve stopped even doing that
3752961 the number of properties on the market this time last year was just over 4000 now were looking at 6300
3752962 i was going to put it on the market last august but i had someone say theyd like to rent it out for six months so i held off
3752963 it turned out to be a really stupid idea because the property market collapsed
3752964 its been on the market for two months now whereas this time last year i think it would have sold in about a week

3753003 this is happening because some of us refused to pay bribes to mavis sebeko the woman in charge

3753005 she does not explain anything only says that she has the power
3753006 tube lines has made enormous profits on the backs of our members hard work yet they seem to expect that they will accept an inferior deal on pay pensions and conditions
3753007 metronet workers can join a final salary pension scheme but tube lines wants to keep the door closed on it and tube lines members are also denied the travel facilities that metronet staff enjoy
3753008 tube lines bottom line seems to be that it is ok for its staff to be treated as second class citizens so long as the dividends keep rolling in for its shareholders
3753009 our members are facing the reality of a 5 per cent inflation rate and soaring energy and food bills and if tube lines wants to avoid a crippling strike it should get back around the table with an offer that meets their needs
3753010 last month the mayor said that he would see to it that all cleaners on metronet contracts would be paid the london living wage by august at the latest but there is still no sign even of that happening
3753011 we are disappointed the rmt is taking this stance and passengers have every right to feel angry over the proposed action
3753012 the rmts vote against the offer and the length of their proposed action defy reason and perhaps suggests there is an ulterior motive behind the rejection they have made no secret of their desire for tube maintenance to return to public ownership
3753013 despite rmt claims that the deal is not equal to that set at metronet tube lines believes its pay and conditions are very competitive and amongst the best in the rail industry
3753014 for example employees get 29 days of annual leave as well as eight bank holidays and employees in operational grades receive an 80 per cent subsidy on travel

3753042 destroy judah way worse than how cotto did it last year
3753043 im on a much higher skill level than he is
3753044 and after beating judah i want to go into the ring again against margarito
3753045 i pounded on him then hurt my right hand then my left
3753046 i was hurt but i refused to quit i went the full 12 rounds
3753047 i am happy my team won and that the fight will be staged in germany
3753048 berlin is very special to me that is where i defeated ruiz in 2005 to become world champion fighting in the max schmeling halle again will be like a home match
3753049 he has gone through the full preparation twice and can t wait to get back into the ring
3753050 nikolai has improved a lot under the guidance of his new coach alexander zimin
3753051 hopefully that will result in a plan if he wants to go with the de la hoya fight ill contact richard schaefer and will start that negotiations
3753052 its gonna take maybe a week or so but theres no reason for undue haste its a very important decision for mannys career a lot of money involved and were gonna go slowly
3753053 its an honor to fight a legend like de la hoya if this fight pushes through i will give my very best in preparing for this fight
3753054 i believe freddie when he said i can beat de la hoya
3753055 im telling you as jeffs attorney a deal has been reached
3753056 it took a lot of work a lot of effort a lot of discussion but we got it done
3753057 to describe the incredibly weird things that are happening today
3753058 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
3753059 the past month or so ive been testing a lot and going out of town a lot and just last week i was in nashville for two days testing so ive been out of town a lot and were working on it right now pretty hard so well see what we can come up with here pretty soon
3753060 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
3753061 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
3753062 the attacks that weve shown have demonstrated that its easy to get the pin as well as the card data out of chip and pin terminal and this means that simply holding your hand over the terminal is no good in other words the customer cannot defend himself or herself no matter how astute and careful they are therefore surely the banks need to take responsibility
3753063 we have seen no evidence from the cambridge academic paper of anything we did not know or anything that presents a real world threat to card security
3753064 the method identified by the cambridge university paper requires specialist knowledge and has inherent technical difficulties this method is therefore not reproducible on a large scale nor does it take into account the fraud monitoring used throughout the industry
3753065 id had the idea for the video for a few months before the gadget was released but had no real way of tracking down all of the right words
3753066 being able to search for particular words and know when they appeared in a given clip made the whole project feasible
3753067 j ya son el tipo que se pas en luz roja seguringo que esta borracho
3753068 the philosophy was in these large natural areas fire should be allowed to play its role
3753069 what happened in 88 in yellowstone was probably a passing of the threshold with what the political and social world was comfortable with it was perceived that we were burning up their national park and there would be nothing left of it
3753070 every single day you couldnt believe that youd wake up and there was more fire new fires started
3753071 we learned a lot in 1988 about how much fire a park could take before they ran out of resources
3753072 i think the overriding message of our report was as big as these fires were and as important as they were in many ways they were not historically unprecedented and it was not unnatural
3753073 we very emphatically said and i think the 20 years since then have confirmed that the fires were not an ecological disaster
3753074 actually its a lot greener now hopefully we learned from that its ok to let nature do what it needs to do clean house

3753080 we may have some sellers that make some noise but were absolutely confident of the direction were going
3753081 i dont need a million people to see my things just the right people who have hopefully good taste to buy my things
3753082 youre always taking a risk with sellers from sites like these unless there are guarantees or some seller ratings like the ones ebay has accumulated over time there will always be some bad experiences
3753083 we built our business around ebay they lost focus all their money comes from sellers buyers are what drive the market but you need quality and protection for the sellers or else they dont even want to deal with the buyers

3753092 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
3753093 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3753094 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odors
3753095 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
3753096 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby
3753097 the pill is in effect mirroring a natural shift but at an inappropriate time

3753170 participating in the sead program was a unique opportunity to give back to high school students who may not have grown up with the same privileges and opportunities as many dartmouth students
3753171 many of the relationships and moments that i had with sead are the highlights of my sophomore summer
3753172 the most rewarding part of the program was meeting the sead students and just investing myself in their energy the sead program also gave me a reality check these kids have so much potential and it is the support group created at and by sead that has pushed them to where they are sometimes i overlook the fact that i have always had a support group behind me i am so glad i had the opportunity to be a part of sead and i wish the program could have been longer
3753173 its definitely the most powerful rewarding programs i have ever been a part of and one of the greatest highlights of my time at
3753174 the attacks that weve shown have demonstrated that its easy to get the pin as well as the card data out of chip and pin terminal and this means that simply holding your hand over the terminal is no good in other words the customer cannot defend himself or herself no matter how astute and careful they are therefore surely the banks need to take responsibility
3753175 we have seen no evidence from the cambridge academic paper of anything we did not know or anything that presents a real world threat to card security
3753176 the method identified by the cambridge university paper requires specialist knowledge and has inherent technical difficulties this method is therefore not reproducible on a large scale nor does it take into account the fraud monitoring used throughout the industry

3753231 adrenalin is the best painkiller and the crowd could see i was struggling and really got behind me they were fantastic
3753232 its just the drive that got me through i suppose
3753233 ive trained for so many years for this my coach gave me a slap too anything to take the pain away from my back
3753234 ive had scans and everything it was decided that competing would cause no further damage
3753235 i struggled i had a back injury coming into the competition if the situation had been different i would probably have pulled out a couple of weeks ago but there was nobody to replace me
3753236 i just tried to dig deep and get through the training so i could make it to beijing
3753237 i was in some discomfort in training and only managed to snatch up to 75kg in training and only clean and jerked 85kg
3753238 its not that the weights felt heavy the problem was the pain i was in but after so many years of training to get this far i didnt want to pull out
3753239 my time was pretty average i have had a lot of experience at 200 of going out too fast and struggling at the end at the worlds i went off ridiculously fast and got smashed on the last 50 but i have learned from my mistakes

3753244 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3753245 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3753246 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3753247 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3753248 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3753249 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3753250 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3753251 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3753257 the issues with the double child voter registration have more to do with societys indiscipline or rather misunderstanding of the democratic process and weak institutional watchdogs than the wrong doing of government
3753258 accusations and counter accusations between the new patriotic party npp and the national democratic congress ndc over the voter registration exercise can create an atmosphere for a coup detat in the country
3753259 we are creating an atmosphere of tension in the country and there is danger ahead of us there is also an added danger of creating a conducive atmosphere for coup makers to justify the seizure of power
3753260 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3753261 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3753262 in all we expect cpi inflation to rise to about 5 7 per cent year on year in august as household energy prices rise even though oil prices are lower reaching about 5 per cent year on year by year end thereafter even with the recent drop in global commodity prices and the likelihood that the uk economy is in recession we expect cpi inflation to stay above 3 per cent until quarter three next year staying also above the 2 per cent target throughout 2009 and 2010
3753263 within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3753264 it is vital that pay rises keep pace with inflation to ensure that our standard of living is not slashed over coming months better pay would also improve consumer confidence and lessen the chances of a long and deep economic slowdown next year
3753265 profiteering oil firms or it is inevitable that wages will have to rise in response to these higher prices
3753266 certainly everything has gone up hugely feed went up a huge amount last year from about 146 a tonne to 220 a tonne the transport situation has had a huge impact on us as well we are paying about 300 a month extra on diesel
3753267 we have no way of controlling that either the cost of the grain or the amount we feed the birds the birds have to be fed and that is our biggest issue
3753268 it has been extremely difficult although the supermarkets have moved they generally moved a bit behind the prices we have had to pay
3753269 we have ordered food in advance knowing we would lose money if they did not move it has all been hand to mouth
3753270 pig farmers are suffering huge losses because they also have huge inputs and the marketplace is not matching that in terms of farm gate prices so they are making losses the eggs guys are just about staying afloat
3753271 it comes back to the supermarkets in the end there is this imbalance of power within the supply chain the supermarkets are at the top wielding all the power and farmers have very little negotiating power and get railroaded by the supermarkets
3753272 at the moment we are seeing efforts from supermarkets to keep their shelf prices down so they can keep their customers happy
3753273 the fall in transactions is an effect of the credit crunch and i guess some people are just waiting to see what happens next
3753274 however in terms of prices the scottish housing market is reverting to type when you compare it with a few years ago
3753275 the bottom line is house price increases are at a level much nearer inflation which makes for a much more sensible and sustainable market

3753286 despite the global recessionary trends mounting inflation and prospects of elections in the near future privately held businesses phbs in india have shown the highest level of optimism about their prospects for next year

3753288 phbs in india are less optimistic about their revenue prospects in 2008 84 per cent compared to 2007 92 per cent however their levels of optimism regarding revenue performance are well above the global average of 63 per cent
3753289 economic growth is expected to ease back in the coming quarters and years
3753290 the economy has been slowing since the middle of 2007 08 and growth will continue to ease as the recent rounds of policy tightening and the impact of recent currency appreciation continues to feed through
3753291 domestic demand will continue to drive growth in the short term supported by strengthening exports as this sector continues to gain competitiveness although short term gains may be more moderate owing to the weaker global economy

3753403 so why wouldnt he hold the other nba players accountable unless the rules only apply to the american players
3753404 we could say that too but at the end of day we are still representing the nba
3753405 no matter if were saying the actions have nothing to do it at the end of day we have to go back home and our jobs are there
3753406 it would start an international riot if we did it but they arent us

3753426 people told me it was something theyd show to their daughters i mean i was obsessed like everyone else with fashion magazines when i was a teenager its natural to look for the body ideal
3753427 here is a woman a great athlete 160 pounds who can bench press her own body weight and squat 180 pounds

3753441 daca va reactiona prea violent impotriva ucrainei atunci risca sa provoace reactia pe care si o doreste cel mai putin se vor ridica bariere privind comertul si investitiile in fata companiilor sale se va confrunta cu o abordare mai antagonica a tranzitului energiei si mai mult risca sa sperie ucraina si sa o determine sa caute protectia occidentala
3753442 contracareze presiunile pe care rusia le pune asupra statelor vecine mai ales asupra ucrainei cel mai probabil noua tinta a eforturilor moscovei de a crea o noua sfera de hegemonie statele unite si uniunea europeana trebuie sa fie foarte clare n r in dialogul cu rusia pentru ca ucraina si georgia sa nu fie condamnate sa ramana intr o zona gri

3753545 bound to be the case that theres a quarter or two of negative growth
3753546 the adjustment of the uk economy to higher commodity prices and a more realistic pricing of credit will be painful
3753547 and we will return if not to the nice decade then at least one that as central bankers say is not so bad
3753548 although the report dilutes fears that the bank of england will raise interest rates it also suggests that any cuts will be some time off as the bank is determined to show its commitment to bringing inflation down to 2
3753549 while we would not rule out a cut in november particularly if the economy slows markedly further and oil prices continue to retreat we are maintaining our view that interest rates will stay at 5 until early 2009

3753556 as a parent and grandparent i understand the challenges facing american families
3753557 we need to focus on lifting up not wearing down american families
3753558 not only did we judge senator biden on his voting records for supporting working families we also examined the benefits that his own employees receive like paid leave and flextime
3753559 senator biden is stepping up voluntarily because he believes in progressive policies and acts on his beliefs in the real world managing his staff
3753560 senator biden has shown what can be accomplished through legislation and a personal commitment to policies that benefit working families
3753561 as our nation wrestles with a host of economic and other issues involving working families senator biden deserves to be congratulated and recognized nationally for his leadership and support
3753562 i had a series of live video satellite links scheduled for later that day and they were canceled by russia today

3753566 not many viewers and readers suspect that their minds are being bombed out the same way as the ossetian villages but with words and sentences instead of shells
3753567 i think its critical to see what atrocities georgians actually committed in s ossetia if they are real then nato is unlikely to trust georgia to make responsible use of the nato mutual defense fabric

3753570 the commission was created and empowered to consider the requests of federal and district of columbia inmates who are parole eligible as well as d c offenders who are on supervised release from prison this extension will allow the commission to continue to perform its important work
3753571 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country the tax system that allows this wholesale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hardworking americans who pay their fair share of taxes we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls
3753572 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3753573 this report makes clear that too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and avoid paying their fair share in the united states
3753574 this is the missing piece in californias historic effort to reduce global warming pollution if passed and signed into law s b 375 will slow the insidious growth in miles driven by california drivers which threatens to overwhelm our other efforts to reduce emissions of heat trapping pollution it will result in better designed communities with less spread out development where people dont need to drive so much consumers will also save money by having transportation alternatives during this era of rising gas prices
3753575 sb 375 is a top priority for us and senator steinberg deserves tremendous credit for his work to enact it this is the first bill in the united states to align housing policy transportation funding and climate policy the bill does this by promoting development patterns that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by increasing housing choices reducing commute distances and reducing congestion

3753585 the farm bill takes steps to ensure that small farms receive the support and resources they need but the bush administration is ignoring the letter of the law and undermining the safety net that protects our farmers i urge the usda to apply the provisions of the farm bill fairly and correctly and live up to the commitments we have made to farmers and growers
3753586 effective with the date of publication of this notice to be assured that producers on farms with base acres of 10 acres or less are prohibited from receiving payments as provided in the 2008 farm bill farm service agency county committees coc will not approve requests for farm combination reconstitutions of farms having base acres of 10 acres or less if the request was received after the date of enactment of the 2008 farm bill may 22 2008 however as an exception to the above rule a farm with a total of 10 base acres or less may combine with another farm if one of the farms undergoes a change in land ownership to qualify for this exception the owners of each of the farms participating in the new combination must be identical and have identical shares in both farms
3753587 the managers intend for the department to allow for the aggregation of farms for purposes of determining the suspension of payments on farms with 10 base acres or less the managers expect for the department to review farms in this category on an annual basis rather than prohibiting payments to these farms for the life of the farm bill
3753588 john mccains claim that hell put jobs first is laughable in light of his history of putting his lobbyist friends ahead of americas workers at every turn

3753597 in may i sat down with mark filip deputy attorney general to discuss the dramatic increase in chicago gang violence
3753598 senator obama and i asked the dept of justice to provide federal assistance to chicago law enforcement efforts in combating this rise in gang activity i am pleased to see that the justice department agreed and with todays announcement has made combating gang violence in chicago a top priority
3753599 as chicago continues to experience some of the highest rates of gang violence in the country we must do everything we can to make our neighborhoods safe again
3753600 todays announcement that chicago will receive support under the department of justices anti gang initiative is an important and welcome development however we must do more to ensure our law enforcement officials have the resources and support they need to combat the violence i am committed to continuing to work with senator durbin and mayor daley to keep our children and communities safe
3753601 the anti war movement must set a standard of resistance not accommodate what is intolerable
3753602 only the people not the politicians can force open debate over why the u s occupation must end now
3753603 whether one plans on voting for obama or not we all must be in the streets making our clear opposition to torture bloody occupations and any new war against iran vividly clear
3753604 some people say protest does not work they are wrong what does not work is passivity in the face of a government being more widely exposed as committing war crimes and a public increasingly sickened by what is being done in their name if the anti war movement was so ineffectual why did the new york times have to call it the other superpower
3753605 world cant wait will be joining thousands of people in the denver protests who want to send a different message to the world bring the whole bush program of lying to start illegitimate wars and threatening other countries spying on citizens justifying torture to a halt
3753606 tomorrows national day of action is the cornerstone of an historic week for the exxon mccain 08 campaign
3753607 activists across the country are gathering to tell people in their own communities what the exxon mccain 08 campaign has in store for them with exxon john promising more handouts for big oil at the expense of working families struggling to pay skyrocketing energy costs the choice in this election is clear if you want more of the same skyrocketing energy costs and giveaways for big oil vote exxon mccain 08
3753608 we dont have to choose between national security and protecting the environment
3753609 todays agreement maintains the navys ability to test and train while shielding whales and other vulnerable species from harmful underwater noise
3753610 this agreement confirms we can achieve environmental protection while maintaining our important national security standards
3753611 it does not need to be an either or scenario when it comes to ensuring our waters are protected and our marine wildlife is healthy
3753612 limiting sonar use in breeding grounds and other key habitat areas is essential for the conservation of whales dolphins and other marine mammals
3753613 this agreement protects both national security and our most treasured natural resources
3753614 la pasividad de las grandes fuerzas pol ticas nacionales y la complicidad activa del psoe y el gobierno
3753615 y ojo con lo que empieza a pasar en la comunidad valenciana no han ido m s lejos porque all ni el pp ni el psoe han necesitado los votos de los nacionalistas para gobernar
3753616 lamentablemente la estrategia global del pp se est limitando a copiar lo peor del zapaterismo ha subrayado aquello que nos ha llevado a una situaci n en la que en espa a gane quien gane las elecciones terminan mandando los nacionalistas
3753617 president bushs failed economic policies continue to take their toll on americans as more workers have filed for unemployment benefits this week than at any time since the 2001 recession
3753618 time and again democrats have worked in a bipartisan way to extend unemployment benefits for 3 5 million workers provide 130 million american households with recovery rebates and increase the minimum wage
3753619 congress will act on an economic recovery package that will create americans jobs grow our economy and support disaster assistance we are hopeful that president bush and his republican allies in congress will recognize as the american people do that we need immediate action to strengthen our economy
3753620 industrial countries are largely responsible for the global climate crisis the world now faces
3753621 but recent emissions trends demonstrate that it will require an active partnership between industrial and developing countries if the climate is to be stabilized
3753622 while we commend you for personally apologizing to the newspapers on behalf of the fbi and for personally bringing this matter to the committees attention we expect to receive a more complete accounting of this violation of the justice departments guidelines intended to protect privacy and journalists first amendment rights
3753623 if nothing else these new findings suggest a pressing need for the legislation we have cosponsored with a bipartisan group of senators to create a qualified privilege for reporters
3753624 the fbi used the exigent letters in non emergency circumstances failed to ensure that there were duly authorized investigations to which the requests could be tied and failed to ensure that nsls were issued promptly after the fact

3753630 exxon johns out of touch agenda may be a boon for big oil but its a bust for americas working families
3753631 exxon mccain 08 is the perfect ticket for big oil because only mccain looks at record profits and promises 4 billion more the choice in this election is perfectly clear if you want four more years of flawed energy policies dominated by gimmicks and giveaways for big oil vote for exxon john in november
3753632 exxon john theres pain at the pump for americans these days but exxon john follows the oil companys ways big oils profits soar exxon john says four billion more tax breaks for big oil most say no not exxon john with lobbyists running his show theres two million reasons exxon john likes big oil theyve given him two million bucks to protect their spoils the future in energy is alternatives they say but thats not exxon johns way exxon john when it comes to big oil more of the same while the rest of us toil exxon john
3753633 good morning the situation in georgia continues to deteriorate because of the escalation of russias use of military force i have spoken to president saakashvili and conveyed my deep regret over the loss of life and the suffering of the people of georgia for many months i have warned that there needs to be active international engagement to peacefully address the disputes over south ossetia and abkhazia including a high level and neutral international mediator and a genuine international peacekeeping force not simply russian troops no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country russia has escalated its military campaign through strategic bombing and the movement of its ground forces into the heart of georgia there is no possible justification for these attacks i reiterate my call for russia to stop its bombing campaign to stop flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and to withdraw its ground forces from georgia the georgian government has proposed a cease fire and the russian government should accept it there is also an urgent need for humanitarian assistance to reach the people of georgia and casualties on both sides the united states europe and all other concerned countries must stand united in condemning this aggression and seeking a peaceful resolution to this crisis we should continue to push for a united nations security council resolution calling for an immediate end to the violence this is a clear violation of the sovereignty and internationally recognized borders of georgia the un must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world i welcome the visit of the french and finnish foreign ministers to georgia as a first step toward mediation there should also be a united nations mediator to address this crisis and the united states should fully support this effort we should also convene other international forums to condemn this aggression to call for an immediate halt to the violence and to review multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia including russias interest in joining the world trade organization the violence taking place along the black sea is just miles from sochi the site for the winter olympics in 2014 it only adds to the tragedy and outrage of the current situation that russia has acted while the world has come together in peace and athletic competition in beijing this action is wholly inconsistent with the olympic ideal while returning to a pre august 8 military posture is a necessary first step to resolving this crisis we cannot tolerate the unacceptable status quo that led to this escalation that means russian peacekeeping troops should be replaced by a genuine international peacekeeping force georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions going forward the united states and europe must support the people of georgia beyond immediate humanitarian assistance we must provide economic assistance and help rebuild what has been destroyed i have consistently called for deepening relations between georgia and transatlantic institutions including a membership action plan for nato and we must continue to press for that deeper relationship the relationship between russia and the west is long and complicated there have been many turning points for good and ill this is another turning point let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past that is why the united states and the international community must speak out strongly against this aggression and for peace and security
3753634 the unemployment rate spiked again in july to 5 7 percent its highest level in more than four years and a strong signal that come election day millions of americans will still be hunting for work the nations employers cut their payrolls for the seventh consecutive month this time by 51 000 jobs the government reported friday for millions still at work hours were reduced a hidden form of unemployment and the average raise was less than enough to keep up with inflation
3753635 when president bush took office nearly 13 percent of american jobs were in manufacturing in november that figure fell below 10 percent for the first time ever and at last measure was 9 95 percent
3753636 economic plans really are an extension of the bush administration policies
3753637 mccain doesnt like to hear it but his economic plans really are an extension of bush administration policies when all the economic mumbo jumbo is removed that fact remains
3753638 you could make an argument that theres been great progress economically
3753639 john mccain http search politico com results cfm subject john mccain went on the offensive thursday in a key battleground state hoping to blunt criticism that he was indirectly responsible for the possible loss of more than 8 000 jobs in wilmington ohio http search politico com results cfm subject ohio

3753644 top current advisers to sen john mccains presidential campaign last year lobbied for a european plane maker that beat boeing to a 35 billion air force tanker contract taking sides in a bidding fight that mccain has tried to referee for more than five years
3753645 a 35 billion contract has been awarded to europes airbus consortium to build the latest generation of tanker planes the decision has sparked anger from boeings congressional supporters and critics of outsourcing it has also focused attention on mccains reliance on lobbyists in his campaign for president because his finance chairman and several other top advisers lobbied for airbus last year when it was in fierce competition with boeing for the air force contract mccain finance chairman thomas g loeffler and susan e nelson who left loefflers lobbying firm to be mccains finance director both began lobbying for airbuss parent company in 2007 senate records show william l ball iii a former secretary of the navy and frequent mccain surrogate on the trail also lobbied for airbus as did john green who recently took a leave from ogilvy public relations to serve as mccains legislative liaison
3753646 i want to congratulate verizon cwa and ibew for reaching an agreement that will provide tens of thousands of workers with the good pay health care and benefits they deserve and i want to commend verizon for recognizing the good work that union members can do for their company
3753647 i commend the military officers who presided over this trial and served on the hearing panel under difficult and unprecedented circumstances they and all our armed forces continue to serve this country with valor in the fight against terrorism that the hamdan trial the first military commission trial with a guilty verdict since 9 11 took several years of legal challenges to secure a conviction for material support for terrorism underscores the dangerous flaws in the administrations legal framework its time to better protect the american people and our values by bringing swift and sure justice to terrorists through our courts and our uniform code of military justice and while it is important to convict anyone who provides material support for terrorism it is long past time to capture or kill osama bin laden and the terrorists who murdered nearly 3000 americans
3753648 its shameful that john mccain and his campaign continue to deliberately mislead voters about his record on renewable energy hundreds of stump speeches and millions of dollars in ads cannot change a two decade long record of consistently voting against renewable energy
3753649 while his ad may talk about creating jobs john mccains failure to support key clean energy tax incentives could cost the 116 000 hardworking americans in the wind and solar industries alone their jobs it will also sacrifice billions in lost economic opportunity
3753650 john mccain couldve been the deciding vote on this issue twice something that wouldve truly helped americas workers and moved us toward energy independence but he was the only senator who didnt even bother to show up and vote
3753651 when it comes to energy independence america needs a plan not political platitudes all talk and no votes thats john mccain
3753652 why does john mccain think its ok for 77 000 tons of dangerous nuclear waste to go through some 44 other states but yet too dangerous to go through his own home state
3753653 john mccain simply cant have it both ways when it comes to the nuclear waste issue its hypocritical and unfair that he supports running hundreds of shipments of dangerous nuclear waste through 44 states and sticking nevadans with 77 000 tons of it forever while at the same time saying hes uncomfortable with it going through his own backyard for even a day
3753654 john mccain is asking nevadans and the residents of 44 states to gamble with their safety yet its not even a bet hes willing to take for arizona
3753655 just like with against them except when it comes to nuclear power and so called clean coal john mccain wants to have his cake and eat it too on the nuclear waste issue hes all for moving thousands of tons highly radioactive waste through communities across the country except when it comes to his home state of arizona
3753656 before an expansion of nuclear power is considered key issues must be addressed including security of nuclear fuel and waste waste storage and proliferation
3753657 we both agreed that it is not the wave of the future its the wave of the present
3753658 this administrations failure to hold contractors accountable is outrageous more and more government responsibilities are being passed along to private companies at huge cost to american taxpayers and at the same time more and more reports emerge of fraud waste and abuse in the contracting process this pattern must be brought to an end which is why i have introduced legislation to bring critically needed reform to the government contracting process and why im calling for an investigation to get to the bottom of this latest abuse of taxpayer resources
3753659 i just spoke separately with secretary rice and president saakashvili about the grave crisis in georgia i told president saakashvili that i was deeply concerned about the well being of the people of georgia
3753660 over the last two days russia has escalated the crisis in georgia through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3753661 as i have said for many months aggressive diplomatic action must be taken to reach a political resolution to this crisis and to assure that georgias sovereignty is protected
3753662 the situation in georgia also requires the deployment of genuine international peacekeeping forces in south ossetia and abkhazia the current escalation of military conflict resulted in part from the lack of a neutral and effective peacekeeping force operating under an appropriate un mandate russia cannot play a constructive role as peacekeeper instead russian actions in both south ossetia and abkhazia appear to be intended to preserve an unstable status quo
3753663 ten years ago al qaeda carried out simultaneous attacks on the u
3753664 the anniversary of these attacks reaffirms the urgent need to root out and take down the al qaeda network
3753665 this painful anniversary also reminds us of the sacrifices made and risks taken every day by americas diplomats and civilian personnel abroad today we honor and thank our foreign service officers and civil servants who serve us all by forging the strong international partnerships necessary to tackle complex global challenges like international terrorism we honor the men and women in uniform who are serving in harms way to defend our security and our deeply held values and we express our gratitude to all who have loved ones civilian and military serving america abroad

3753681 the radio single thats least indicative of a bands true nature
3753682 the global models are good for investigating whats likely to happen on a planetary scale but the resolution is quite coarse when looking at a more localised regional scale
3753683 its a bit like enlarging a digital photograph until it becomes pixellated and all sorts of detail is blurred out
3753684 simulating the climate of the region is a challenge for climate models due in part to the high natural inter annual variability the topography of the region which includes multiple mountain ranges and inland seas and the presence of a slight cooling trend in recent decades despite the global trend being a warming
3753685 we need to confirm this result with other models but a 50 per cent increase in rainfall in such an important agricultural area is a much more hopeful scenario than a 15 per cent decline
3753686 i took the part on the assurance i wouldnt do any nudity i wanted to do something where id be taken seriously and they added a load of scenes with naked girls i was so angry i snubbed my own premiere
3753687 has the misfortune or perhaps the great fortune of being in a band with two guys who tend to overshadow him
3753688 very bare bones and very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
3753689 you showed the sign where it said stun gun in use and you just change the word gun for bolt and its a meat processing plant
3753690 id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3753691 shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling
3753692 im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3753693 god has a way of taking something bad and turning it into something good
3753694 if this hadnt happened i would never have been able to get back with my daughter and have this relationship i have with these two little boys
3753695 im writing every day right here at the piano in this living room this is my best work ever
3753696 the unassailable fact of the matter is that he helped set the stage for the history that has already been made this year as an african american and a woman finished first and second in the race to nomination
3753697 its not my fault that whites over their history have developed a disregard for the intelligence of black people
3753698 comic relief singing dancing ballplaying and generally less intelligent and hard working

3753700 for me the bottom line was finding the right coach for our organization at this time
3753701 it was a rigorous interview process extremely thorough i dont want any perception the other candidates werent qualified or werent good people because they were i just found the candidate thats the right coach for our organization scott gordon really stood out
3753702 if my mother didnt think i should know and my father didnt think i should know and the doctors didnt think i should know i shouldnt let anybody else know
3753703 i was the last one not to have had her period and i didnt like it one bit and my mother was saying you know dont worry about it but i was worried i was really worried
3753704 it made sense somethings weird no ones telling the truth i can tell somethings not right this fits im a freak
3753705 there are probably about seven and a half thousand people women in the u s with the condition
3753706 there is no uterus but what they have internally is testes that you would typically find in a male
3753707 if you told them that they had a y chromosome or a testicle inside them but they were externally female they would completely meltdown
3753708 it is of no benefit to disclose that the gonads were testes instead of ovaries
3753709 i dont have ovaries which i have to have in order to have a child and i dont have a uterus and i dont have fallopian tubes but really i look like any other girl
3753710 i just told her that she was special and had to adopt other peoples babies that dont have mommies and daddies
3753711 sewed up some of the swiss cheese of her soul i check the box every time it comes up male or female female

3753713 the ceasefire agreement specified that they were meant to go backwards they are clearly going forwards
3753714 id like to calm everybody down the russian military is not advancing towards the capital
3753715 in the vicinity of gori a big military depot was discovered containing georgian military hardware
3753716 the depot was unguarded and the military hardware there was battle ready in the interests of demilitarising the conflict zone and ensuring the safety of the population the military hardware and ammunition are now being removed
3753717 i am witnessing a huge column of russian vehicles coming out of gori on the road towards tbilisi there are something like 100 russian lorries support trucks and some armoured personnel carriers in a column that has taken something like 20 minutes to pass me

3753720 desperate residents who live near a shuttered condo complex in northwest houston thronged a city council meeting tuesday begging the mayor to bulldoze the empty buildings candlelight trails at 5626 de soto is a pretty name but the property has become nightmarish the neighbors said although the property is fenced off criminals squatters and drug addicts haunt the buildings they said the city closed the 240 unit development last august citing myriad dangers such as exposed wires broken glass and broken sprinklers mayor bill white appeared to support demolition but said it would be a long and legally difficult process because there are multiple owners of the units
3753721 er zijn een aantal dilemmas waarvan de resultaten erg gespreid zijn dat zijn typisch die situaties waar een it professional door zijn opdrachtgever of zijn hi rarchisch overste wordt gevraagd om iets te doen
3753722 vaak is de redenering dit is de verantwoordelijkheid van managers vragen zij mij iets dat op het randje is dan leg ik mij daarbij neer

3753726 weve really been saddled with an entirely new responsibility to go along with our day jobs
3753727 signing off on compliance and managing the auditors was never part of the job when i took it its a new world for sure
3753728 im spending 80 percent of my time these days with the auditors not securing my enterprise
3753729 encryption is the ultimate protection mechanism because even if someone breaks through all other protection mechanisms and gains access to encrypted data they will not be able to read the data without further breaking the encryption
3753730 key management will become more important as more devices add cryptographic capabilities and thus more data is encrypted
3753731 always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any one thing
3753732 companies that take an architectural approach to business continuity planning are ultimately the most resilient
3753733 its essential to start at the top and work through all levels of the business to determine the critical interconnection points between people processes technologies suppliers and customers
3753734 we have an additional responsibility to cbeyonds public shareholders now
3753735 we need to ensure them along with our customers partners and employees that we can keep the business running even if we have issues with our main production data center
3753736 in getting started you need to develop an in depth understanding of what is really needed to serve customers and generate revenue
3753737 once you have identified the essential elements that must be protected first it becomes a lot easier to prioritize other components and outsource or get rid of non essential items
3753738 tracing the links between departments business functions and applications is vital to determining how long you can be without certain areas without causing irreparable harm to the business
3753739 you need to take all your applications and put them into different buckets and then rank their importance from a business perspective
3753740 in assessing value first determine what level of downtime and data loss is acceptable next assess how long you can survive without having access to these core applications and critical data
3753741 its not just a case of protecting the crucial corporate databases anymore now that email has become the lifeblood of many organizations
3753742 no matter the size or business segment all companies are vulnerable to the potentially devastating effects of losing mission critical data unless they have a solid business continuity plan in place
3753743 at some point most companies will reach zero tolerance for any application downtime or data loss which will put continuous data protection cdp products in the limelight
3753744 its important to recognize that not all applications are of equal value to the organization
3753745 the goal is to take measured steps that balance technology requirements with business needs to lower risks reduce complexities and keep operations up and running in the event of a failure
3753746 in assessing our needs it was clear that backup and recovery was the first line of defense
3753747 to reduce complexities while delivering enterprise class data protection we replaced our current backup environment with bakbones netvault backup
3753748 we weighed the costs and advantages of being able to instantly failover to a secondary site
3753749 it all came down to reducing risks while increasing resiliency
3753750 we now have complete fail over between our production and development environments which greatly enhances our ability to quickly recover from a catastrophic disruption
3753751 technology should be an enabler that supports a series of best business practices
3753752 once you have the right tools you can reduce vulnerabilities while being flexible enough to adapt the plan to ever changing corporate environments
3753753 testing is crucial so is communicating what youre doing to the rest of the organization
3753754 if you want to turn business resiliency into a top corporate asset you need to make the commitment both in time and resources to do all the systems and process analyses and then be serious about supporting all the steps along the way
3753755 this insidious crime of product counterfeiting has become a global phenomenon its no longer the canker of the under developed or developing world
3753756 that counterfeit products denied genuine products of the rightful market share costing governments significant amounts in lost tax revenues as well as threatening jobs
3753757 pitts been coming on strong lately id say pitts at the top of the list right now

3753761 if were not competing effectively with piracy were not going to win

3753763 the industry are f cking morons and make us ship this to you with drm
3753764 now do you people finally believe me that utorrent is owned my bittorrent inc and that bittorrent inc is in the pocket of the mpaa
3753765 this site is so biased you make fox news look like journalists your not on a crusade for pirates rights and accept the fact that companies would like to be paid for their products services
3753766 accept the fact that companies would like to be paid for their products services
3753767 the district courts decision if upheld would have dangerous repercussions far beyond this single case
3753768 that court opinion holding that the secret and unauthorized copying and forwarding of emails while they pass through an email server is not an illegal interception of those emails threatens to wholly eviscerate federal privacy protections against internet wiretapping and to authorize the government to conduct similar email surveillance without getting a wiretapping order from a judge
3753769 elk besturingssysteem dat succesvol wil zijn moet toepassingen degelijk ondersteunen
3753770 het is essentieel om ontwikkelaars aan te trekken en die ontwikkelaars willen twee zaken gebruiksgemak en platformondersteuning de appchecker vervult die twee noden omdat hij de portabiliteitstest vergemakkelijkt
3753771 omgekeerd wil een toepassing ook steeds een zo groot publiek bereiken het is nu makkelijker om vast te stellen op welke distros een applicatie zal draaien en het geeft de mogelijkheid om de platformondersteuning uit te breiden of toch om de kost van een uitbreiding in te schatten
3753772 maar het zal nauwkeurig vaststellen welke de kost is om toepassingen over te zetten naar andere distros dat laat goed doordachte beslissingen toe
3753773 any other horse would be sooking like anything hes amazing youd never get another through it
3753774 hes a tough horse hes a freak hes been a shit of a horse but hes a great patient
3753775 as ross has indicated hes still got some residual problems in the foot that is healing but its clearly not affecting him
3753776 the progress hes made from last saturday to monday to today he just keeps jumping hoops
3753777 i chose 080808 as a symbolic action for the right to freely spread and share information over the internet
3753778 the net is supposed to be free but thats not the case in all the countries around the world including china the country hosting the olympic games starting today 080808
3753779 the other films i released are still alive and seeded
3753780 even the first one that i released in 2006 i wasnt expecting that when i started not many seeds though so they will eventually just fade away completely and thats when the project really is fulfilled for me
3753781 the net is supposed to be free but thats not the case in all the countries around the world including china the country hosting the olympic games starting today 080808
3753782 1 billion people watched the opening ceremony of the games
3753783 1 billion people watched the opening ceremony of the games all of them chinese not to have done so would have been punishable by death or deportation to the us
3753784 by all accounts sydney have won the championship already the rest of us are playing for second place
3753785 when it the injury first happened i wanted to be fit for round one i was tempted to play when we made the final of the pre season cup but i was quickly put back in my box by the medical staff who held me up and i am now feeling fresh
3753786 i have completed the last three sessions so i will definitely put my hand up for selection and i am optimistic about playing at this point in time i consider myself as playing
3753787 i am pretty optimistic with the fitness program i have completed i will be fit enough to finish 90 minutes
3753788 last year we came off a premiership we ran into a few hurdles that we didnt jump well
3753789 we started slowly with the season being so short you really have to start well last year we drew five out of seven the season before we won seven out of seven
3753790 i would not be surprised at all if they go below 47 seconds
3753791 i think they will be mentally and physically strong enough
3753792 in 1994 we had mobile phones that were the size of a brick
3753793 all of life has changed you cannot really compare me to this time just like it would be unfair to compare mark spitz to michael phelps
3753794 i just felt great i came off the turn and just felt like i didnt spend much energy on the way out and just went with all that and just used the extra energy in the second lap and it went quite well
3753795 records dont mean much they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3753796 im going to make mistakes at training and in games but the recruiter cannot afford to make mistakes we dont know what sort of draft concessions the afl will give us yet but weve got to make sure that every pick is absolutely gold pardon the pun because we only get one shot at this and we have to make sure we get the right quality kids to the club
3753797 this does not mean that guy wont be the senior coach after the two years period basically if he performs well does the job in helping build a team from scratch and a culture in the club well then he is in a favourable position
3753798 if he does it well the chances are he will be but there are no guarantees
3753799 yes apart from a lingering ache you dont tend to move on until you get a chance to perform again
3753800 it was a very good performance by the all blacks and there were elements that we werent proud of or happy with but its not the end its not terminal
3753801 it was a bit of a freak accident it was supposed to be an eight week injury but it has turned into a four week injury with surgery
3753802 i will only miss one game so im pretty fortunate
3753803 we are pleased to announce the clutch project has now merged with transmission there will be no more releases of clutch on its own from 1 30 onwards it is bundled inside transmission you can still download clutch 0 4 from the clutchbt com website if you need clutch for an older version of transmission however that release is no longer supported
3753804 ubuntu is probably a technicly good os but unless you like typing commands for everything its complete crap
3753805 it takes me fraction of the time to do whatever people on linux distros like this can do typin in all those damn commands that your supposed to remember
3753806 windows may be complete shit but at least i dont have to remember commands out my asshole just to install a simple program
3753807 pngz u can ueze bothh cli and gui omgz i hat da cli i hat that i hav da options 2 uz euitther
3753808 windows may be complete shit but at least i dont have to remember commands out my asshole just to install a simple program
3753809 applications gt add remove programs instead of synaptic as synaptic lists packages whereas this lists the programs themselves
3753810 we just got our hands on a bootleg of the soundtrack youll recall the
3753811 score was never properly released likely because the film never did very well in theaters unfortunately it was sadly overlooked
3753812 stunning progress hidden problems the dramatic decline of concentrated poverty in the 1990s
3753813 reversal of fortune a new look at concentrated poverty in the 2000s
3753814 for those who thought we may have solved the problem of concentrated poverty the message is we havent done that
3753815 in dallas weve got about 95 percent of the kids in public schools on free or reduced lunch programs
3753816 its clear to me that the number of people in economic distress is increasing rapidly
3753817 robust economic growth together with smart policies that help reduce economic segregation remain critical for helping low income people and places
3753818 weve got to rise above the partisan political battles and come to grips with quality of life issues that affect us all
3753819 with the credit crunch and rising fuel prices its clear that the british workers are ready to get on their bikes
3753820 the recent olympic success of nicole cooke and emma pooley has certainly raised the profile and interest in cycling and our survey revealed that six per cent of workers have recently switched to bikes to get to work
3753821 theres clearly an appetite for making the change to bikes our research suggested that as many as one in five of employees would consider buying a bike if their employer provided a cheaper way of buying a bike whilst we appreciate that great strides for better cycling provision have already been achieved much more could be done to help get workers on to bikes
3753822 too many ci friends and acquaintances are struggling with this issue of how many hours theyre being asked to work the intimation being if you cant work the long hours you cant do the job bye bye
3753823 a coratee is an animal that is similar to a manatee its primary diet is sea cabbage
3753824 it was hunted and killed by tuna companies and sold to you because they are easier to fish they are slow and stupid animals that are loving and soft and on the brink of extinction meaning they are in desperate need of saving
3753825 we picked save the coratee because of two real reasons one i try to live my life and everything i do with a healthy sense of the ridiculous two the mac community is a creative and innovative community hand them a fake animal with no description rather than its kinda like a manatee and people love it it builds community and creates a family feeling that is fun
3753826 when brokenstones went down we started talking with people about getting a site up but vortex beat us to it
3753827 we started talking and we were kinda moving slow brain storming etc then stuff started to go down hill at vortex so we kicked it into gear
3753828 i never want the site to be big or to loose personality
3753829 we included a lot of how would i put this win in the site or love
3753830 preventing damage to the immune systems of persons who are under long term stress such as caregivers to chronically ill family members as well as astronauts soldiers air traffic controllers and people who drive long daily commutes
3753831 if were successful one day a pill may exist to strengthen the immune systems ability to weather chronic emotional stress
3753832 those who pray never lose hope not even in difficult situations even situations that are desperate in human terms this is what the churchs history teaches us
3753833 in human terms their lives could be viewed as a failure but in their martyrdom shines the splendor of love
3753834 who write to me asking me to pray for them and they do not conceal their concerns their problems aspirations and hopes which they carry in their hearts together with the uncertainties through which humanity is living in this period i can assure all
3753835 that i remember you in my prayers especially in the celebration of the holy mass and the recitation of the rosary
3753836 it has been prayer that has sustained the christian people in their trials
3753837 ready for anything jesus is also here so far i have been able to pray and i have said ave crux
3753838 prayer was the secret of this saint a co patroness of europe
3753839 ave maria was the final invocation of saint maximilian kolbe as he held out his arm to the man who killed him by injection
3753840 a climate sensitivity greater than 1 5 c has probably been a robust feature of the earths climate system over the past 420 million years regardless of temporal scaling
3753841 the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate
3753842 predates the hockey stick and that it is very likely that the medieval warm period was a only a regional effect completely refuting the hockey stick and even proving that the medieval warm period was warmer everywhere than current temperature
3753843 which would make it an especially poor indicator of global climate papers have predicted unsurprisingly that going forward yearly temperature variation could
3753844 climate sensitivity parameter to the doubling of pre industrial carbon dioxide
3753845 claim ed that the peer reviewed papers he cites claim that climate change is bunk
3753846 eq climate change sensitivity parameter to the doubling of pre industrial carbon dioxide
3753847 claim ed that the peer reviewed papers he cites claim that climate change is bunk
3753848 op eds and so on that have nothing to do with the scientific debate
3753849 over 400 prominent scientists and rapidly growing disputed man made global warming claims in 2007
3753850 the kyoto theorists have put the cart before the horse
3753851 it is global warming that triggers higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere not the other way round
3753852 no firm link between the documented climate changes described below and warming due to anthropogenic climate change has yet been established
3753853 were not surprised at all there is no clear consensus of scientists that we know of
3753854 on decadal to century timescales periods around ad 750 1000 1400 and 1750 were all equally warm or warmer
3753855 never mind that this conclusion contradicts other paoleclimate reconstructions even if the arctic was warmer in the past that certainly
3753856 no debate on climate change is occurring within the scientific community
3753857 global warming will stop until at least 2015 because of natural variations in the climate scientists have said
3753858 i dont want anyone to leave thinking that this is evidence that co2 doesnt affect climate
3753859 regardless of what politicians tell us the us has no ability to influence the price of oil by increasing supply
3753860 it will have an insignificant effect on prices and the effect will be 10 to 20 years in the future
3753861 if you really want to save money on gas why not work toward energy efficiency
3753862 it is the fact that i see no real benefit to drilling in ecologically sensitive areas
3753863 no debate on climate change is occurring within the scientific community
3753864 i stand by my claim that no debate on climate change is occurring within the relevant scientific community and will continue to stand by that claim until i see a debate in the peer reviewed literature if it doesnt meet this minimum standard it simply isnt part of the scientific debate
3753865 it sure is amazing how many fully debunked denier talking points he repeats and for a man who claims to be interested in the science it is amazing how much time he spends attacking al gore who we all know is not a scientist
3753866 in other words water vapour is not considered a climate forcing because the amount of h
3753867 here we show that over the past 20 years all the trends in the sun that could have had an influence on the earths climate have been in the opposite direction to that required to explain the observed rise in global mean temperatures here is one from nature
3753868 doesnt matter whether you put carbon dioxide in naturally or unnaturally
3753869 but that cant be real because as peden fully admits in his article mann published his hockey stick in 1998 and we know that first ipcc assessment report was released in 1990 how does peden explain this 8 year discrepancy he doesnt
3753870 that the most violent severe storms and tornadoes may become more common as earths climate warms
3753871 though as i said earlier the data is far from certain and we need to be careful not to overstate the
3753872 there are significant differences between the global temperature and the greenland temperature records within the 1881 2005 period
3753873 which would make it an especially poor indicator of global climate
3753874 the human global warming stuff doesnt really add up im not going to support it because it makes no sense
3753875 north america is expected to experience locally severe economic damage plus substantial ecosystem social and cultural disruption from climate change related events
3753876 the views of the four complainants as made clear to the interviewer had been distorted by selective editing
3753877 misled as to the content and purpose of the programmes when they agreed to take part
3753878 pressure to eliminate the words climate change global warming or other similar terms
3753879 the disappearance or unusual delay of websites reports or other science based materials relating to climate
3753880 new or unusual administrative requirements that impair climate related work
3753881 situations in which scientists have actively objected to resigned from or removed themselves from a project because of pressure to change scientific findings
3753882 the administrations position on climate change polar bears and sea ice and will not be speaking on or responding to these issues
3753883 everyone will save their files as xml and you can look inside
3753884 americans just want to be left alone our enemies are determined not to leave us alone but our media our intellectuals and the democratic party are trying to soothe us and assure us that we dont actually have to fight anybody we can win just by sitting still and being america
3753885 in forresters 110 criteria evaluation of contract life cycle management clm vendors we found that certain contract management software providers led the pack because of their advanced functions for contract creation contract repositories analysis and reporting of contractual exposures and benefits and contract compliance
3753886 forrester evaluated how well the product supports the creation of contracts the importing of legacy contracts and contracts from third parties reporting and analysis of existing contracts the management of contract compliance and the optimization of their contracts value
3753887 forrester used vendor surveys and interviews to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each solution for each vendor we interviewed two to three reference clients to get their perspectives on the products strengths and weaknesses and the vendors support and responsiveness
3753888 independent research such as that provided in this forrester research report is an essential tool to companies evaluating contract management solutions these reports provide an in depth evaluation and analysis of all the competitive solutions on the market and rely on multiple interviews with actual users of the software to come to their conclusions it would be difficult for a company to replicate this type of effort in their own internal review process in evaluating technology i highly recommend the use of independent research
3753889 on demand supply management world class strategies practices and technology
3753890 at the risk of engaging in a bit of hyperbole we believe that clm could turn out to be one of the most important new business applications of the first decade of the 21st century
3753891 forresters analysis of clm market data shows that purchases of clm are growing at rates in excess of 25 and we continue to get more client inquiries about clm than any other epurchasing product
3753892 as of this moment no single organization is adequately addressing the needs of those of us seeking to fundamentally transform the human resources function in government and other not for profit organizations by marshalling the unique resources of these two disparate organizations ipma hr and hroa we are effectively establishing a comprehensive body of knowledge that we believe will serve public servants well
3753893 as we continue to see an unprecedented number of public employees retire over the next few years it is critical that we increase our focus on talent acquisition and management human capital strategies and hr service delivery effectiveness and efficiency

3753925 we continue to experience one of the more challenging retail environments in recent memory the combined effects of the downturn in the real estate market along with rising energy prices has impacted consumer spending which in turn has led to disappointing retail sales particularly for a number of our department and chain store customers although the decrease in net sales reduced our gross profit dollars during the quarter compared to last year we have been successful in achieving efficiencies in our supply chain which helped to increase our gross margin expressed as a percentage of net sales during the second quarter of 2008 we recognize however that we have more work to do in this area and hope to continue to build on this progress in the coming months
3753926 we have aggressively increased our promotional activity in response to the lackluster demand from budget conscious consumers in order to stimulate sales and maintain or build market share still we expect sales over the next several months to remain under pressure and understand the importance of controlling costs and inventory during this uncertain time one thing that will not change however is our commitment to our customers we believe that we are well positioned to weather the current economic downturn and look forward to the upcoming holiday season

3753945 if in our own strength confide our striving would be losing im not the right man on our side did i mess up again you mean those arent luthers words but luther said this and luther said that and luther luther luther i love luther period do i believe he was right when we said that we should run the jews out of town and burn down their synagogues do we take to heart every utterance from the mighty luthers lips luther was a sinful man just as we are sinful men and women the lord used luther in a mighty way to uphold the cross of christ and his sufficiency alone anywhere and any place that the sufficiency of christ is challenged by either the free will of man the power of other gods the helping hand of the law or any other counterfit method to attain righteousness we ought to be engaged in lifting high the cross of christ higher and higher we must increase he must decrease right wrong i was just seeing if you were awake or if you were a pelagian sympathizer he must increase i must decrease

3753955 so i keep my views to myself i believe that those who take decisions know why they take those decisions i sincerely believe that everything would have to be looked at in totality before those decisions were arrived at what i would want to see now is how we can make the best out of the existing situation
3753956 i cannot make a comment on what i do not know
3753957 i think sometime in august i hope to come to a conclusion on what im going to do if im going to play or not this year
3753958 mats has decided he will make a decision by aug 1
3753959 i know there was talk about the first of august but i said sometime in august hopefully ill be able to make a decision i wont make that until i really feel comfortable with making a good decision

3753969 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved

3753972 my self esteem is no longer built into having a perfect body although i have the same hang ups as many other women
3753973 at the moment im a bit curvier having done the tour so it was big mental step forward for me to show my natural self rather than my worked out honed self
3753974 i definitely have commitment issues it is lovely to be somebody and find a connection and by intimate and open that is wonderful but i have learnt there are also minuses

3753978 i must commend the community for their fortitude in challenging the previous decision which would have allowed both the carnagat and chancellors road to have been closed this would have caused major problems
3753979 after a series of meetings and discussions involving senior roads service personnel and contractors representatives along with myself and local councillors pat mcginn and turlough murphy there was an acknowledgement that the original proposals had been ill conceived
3753980 alternative proposals were given to us to put to the community along with an assurance that on no account would both roads be closed at the same time
3753981 they also are in the process of arranging an information meeting for all the community where people can come and listen to presentations from roads service and the contractors in relation to the a1 works which we appreciate is a major development that is the way forward
3753982 after extensive lobbying i am extremely pleased that the head road in annalong is programmed for extensive patching and surface dressing this summer
3753983 these works which should be completed by mid september will improve the condition of head road
3753984 to my mind the contractors on the new a1 dual carriageway have not taken on board the impact on local residents communities and businesses as they progress
3753985 as a local representative mr murphy should have a greater awareness of how the road works are affecting his constituents
3753986 it has actually turned me against the entire festival it is all very well but when peoples rights start being abused then its not on
3753987 it is a bit lousy of the bbc to come down and ride rough shod over old people and disabled people we have these disabled spaces for a reason

3753991 there were some surprises as news of the arrests came through
3753992 some of the arrests were expected and others were a surprise being arrested is not proof of guilt being released is not proof of innocence
3753993 from the familys point of view it was obvious that the gardai are looking at a particular classification of people
3753994 talk of smuggling and feuding gangs has been put behind us it is clear those arrested have serious connections to one political party
3753995 not only are they accusing the psni but also the gardai
3753996 on behalf of the team i would like to take this opportunity to thank schrader for their support in this project as it enabled the team to travel to the competitions
3753997 in addition the financial assistance from schrader enabled us to carry out vital repairs to our engine after our race at silverstone to ensure we definitely got off the starter grid this week
3753998 we are proud to have represented both the university and northern ireland in germany
3753999 we also had to present the car as a business with full cost analysis which looks very good on your cv if you are pursuing a career in motor sport
3754000 you two were at the end of the universe eh right at the edge of knowledge itself and youre busy blogging
3754001 it was a bit strange when i walked into the meeting they were already using my name
3754002 i would have already have known many of them from helping them with problems in past i got a very warm welcome
3754003 it is the easiest thing in the world to drive a vehicle drive around for a few minutes and drive out again you are not really seen and the area is not really policed
3754004 we cant force our will on the community we can only work in partnership with them
3754005 the message is that if you dont want anti social behaviour criminal damage drugs or violence then tell us who is doing it and we will do our best to we can within our remit to do something to stop it
3754006 there appears to be a lot of recreational violence and recreational vandalism
3754007 i dont think there is a problem with police anymore than with the ambulance service or the fire brigade
3754008 aminority of young people see statutory services and attack them
3754009 we have to re educate young people in the way they should behave i dont believe it is just an anti police thing
3754010 i visited st malachys primary school this morning with dpp member and local community chairperson collette oreilly to see the damage there and i was extremely disappointed at the amount of destruction that i saw
3754011 18 windows most of which were double glazing and a georgian door were smashed by the vandals last night
3754012 i cant understand what would drive someone to do such an act of wanton destruction
3754013 just three months ago 44 windows were smashed in another incident
3754014 this damage costs the school a lot of money to fix and takes funding away from very important aspects of the pupils education at st malachys
3754015 i understand that there were four young people aged in their early teens involved in the incident and that they were seen doing so by a local resident
3754016 reject passivity accept responsibility lead courageously and expect gods reward
3754017 at one stage we even had to go up on the footpath so the water wouldnt get in the car
3754018 people were walking in water up to their knees and cars were left abandoned in the water ive never seen anything like it it was so heavy we couldnt even see the planes coming into the airport
3754019 at first i do not think many of us realised just how serious the situation was but it soon dawned on people as the water started to raise along sections of the road that traffic was stuck in
3754020 it was unbelievable just how quickly the water rose and we were fortunate that on two occasions that we didnt have to abandon our vehicle
3754021 following the strike action on july 16 17 discussions were held with trade union representatives to agree the manner in which collections were to be caught up
3754022 it was agreed that double lifts would be undertaken on july 23 24 for black bin waste and on august 3 4 for blue bin waste with a total of four days to achieve the catch up
3754023 the arrangement for payment for a double lift followed usual practice with payment agreed at an additional payment at six hours at overtime rate with all collections completed on that day where possible
3754024 one trade union asked for time in lieu for four days involved instead of payment whilst other requested payment as per usual practice
3754025 i received an immense amount of calls from people complaining their bins were not collected
3754026 they couldnt understand why we had two black bin collections in a row
3754027 we never expected this would happen we thought we were doing her a favour allowing her to take sasha out of the country
3754028 we will have her christmas presents in the closet that shes never seen

3754034 tube lines has made enormous profits on the backs of our members hard work yet they seem to expect that they will accept an inferior deal on pay pensions and conditions
3754035 metronet workers can join a final salary pension scheme but tube lines wants to keep the door closed on it and tube lines members are also denied the travel facilities that metronet staff enjoy
3754036 tube lines bottom line seems to be that it is ok for its staff to be treated as second class citizens so long as the dividends keep rolling in for its shareholders
3754037 our members are facing the reality of a 5 inflation rate and soaring energy and food bills and if tube lines wants to avoid a crippling strike it should get back around the table with an offer that meets their needs
3754038 while lower and middle income shoppers increased their spending at wal mart when the economy started to soften the report finds that the bigger change has been upper income consumers who have flocked to wal mart in the last six months as gas prices soared the report says that the combination of 4 prescriptions competitive prices in key food categories and wider product assortments are responsible for the shift
3754039 of course wal mart isnt the only store benefiting from this shift in shopping patterns as consumers balance the need to save money on groceries with the pressure to use less gas
3754040 they wanted to see whats going on in the uw colleges to see the learning environment for themselves im pleased to be able to show these prospective future university faculty what an amazing campus uw richland is to introduce them to our dynamic environment and show them that great learning takes place in environments that look quite different from uw madison

3754048 bad managing and bad coaching i cant get em to play as hard as i need em to play right now were not getting any clutch timely hits were not getting clutch pitches it seems like all we do is talk about the negatives
3754049 it seems like this team is beat down we need to find a way for this team to have fun
3754050 this is great to get two wins and holding them to four hits
3754051 to do that against these people the pelicans they play some really good baseball
3754052 the last couple of games weve scored early then we dont score any more thats part of the process its getting late guys are tired you just have to keep battling
3754053 you never have to worry about it when hes in the lineup you know hes going to put together some good at bats

3754099 the ewga championship is a premier event for women of all playing ability levels
3754100 for some of our members who did not grow up playing sports this is one of their first experiences in competitive play the growth and continued excellence of the ewga championships demonstrates our ongoing commitment to providing women with more opportunities through the game of golf
3754101 we usually dont host national level events hopefully the weather stays nice and everyone has a good time
3754102 it is great that the ewga championships are being held at bristol harbour

3754114 all of us are morons in the other mans game
3754115 most other journalism programmes require students to focus on print or broadcast journalism this course responds to the way the profession is moving and gives graduates greater flexibility when applying for jobs
3754116 nobody delivers news in a way thats adapted to how young people consume media
3754117 through a series of freak occurrences a group of actors shooting a big budget war movie are forced to become the soldiers they are portraying
3754118 it was even worse than the hateful stuff they used in promoting it
3754119 an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3754120 its never funny when good and decent human beings are humiliated
3754121 in fact it is dangerous and disgusting this film is all that and more

3754152 always one step ahead bmw together with continental and mobileye is first to leap ahead and go to market with a multi functional camera in the area of driver assistance
3754153 what is special about the bmw solution is that it runs the three functions sli hba and ldw all using the same camera and microprocessor resources
3754154 the technical challenge is very high compared to a standalone system because the requirements from the camera control are conflicting the combined system must run at a higher frame rate than a standalone system and must share images among the different customer functions the combined system has the advantage of reducing the overall system cost and saving windshield space rather than populating the windshield area with multiple sensing systems the integrative approach allows a single sensor system to perform all the functions and hence reduce space and cost

3754159 i enjoyed working with writer turned director sanjay chhel and mallika

3754186 were excited to be part of this groundbreaking effort in cleveland
3754187 cab drivers are in all parts of the county at all times of the day and night and they can effectively double the eyes of police on the street the taxis on patrol for safety program is essentially a neighborhood watch on wheels program that can make a big difference in getting dangerous drivers off the streets before they hurt themselves or someone else
3754188 heightened law enforcement efforts kicking off operation wolf pack in support of the national drunk driving over the limit under arrest crackdown will combine 16 dui checkpoints and hundreds of hours of targeted patrols by police departments throughout the region to let motorists know that it doesnt matter where you go in the county police officers everywhere will be on the lookout for impaired drivers
3754189 through the tops program law enforcement will benefit from the added watchful eyes of taxicab drivers on our streets and the greater cleveland community will benefit from a safer environment

3754207 if you were a dragon in a flower bed what would you be doing
3754208 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3754209 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3754210 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3754211 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3754212 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3754213 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3754214 las vacaciones me han dado una buena posibilidad para recuperarme as que espero estar bien para brno cuando volv de laguna seca hace 23 d as el m dico me dijo que necesitaba una semana y media de descanso absoluto no pude entrenarme as que pas unos d as de relax en mallorca desconectado de todo y descansando
3754215 posteriormente me quitaron los puntos de la mano en barcelona y entonces comenc mi rehabilitaci n la mano sigue doli ndome pero la mu eca tiene buena movilidad y los dedos no est n hinchados el pie sigue vendado para evitar movimientos bruscos
3754216 we feared hed broken his ribs because fede said he heard a crack
3754217 but after the doctors assessed him in the treatment room we think its just badly bruised
3754218 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3754219 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3754220 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3754221 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3754222 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3754223 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3754224 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3754225 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3754226 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3754227 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3754228 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3754229 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3754230 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3754231 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3754232 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3754233 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3754234 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3754235 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3754236 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3754237 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3754238 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3754239 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3754240 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3754241 certainly the death penalty could be sought in every capital case tried but that would clearly be a decision made without regard to thought of anything other than emotions
3754242 it makes no sense but points out even more so why we must look at case law in our evaluation process
3754243 they were damaged and puddle jumping and taking off thats what they were doing
3754244 you have some newspaper reports that say the army captured the saucer but as far as the case itself the official standing on the roswell case is that it didnt happen
3754245 a condition a situation or a state of being of a group of persons characterized by an advanced degree of confusion that has not quite reached panic proportions
3754246 there were thousands of people who saw these things up and down the east coast
3754247 what i did was to figure out the flight path trajectories i worked with all types of people aeronautical people pilots astronomers scientists jet people police officers air force people they helped and assisted me by putting this whole mess of sightings together
3754248 and over all the years researching the story it just kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger
3754249 by using the blue book as my primary source i would go into local newspapers and just pick up the trails when i figured out what direction these ufos were flying i would go from the baltimore area and through maryland west virginia and ohio and i picked up the trail these ufos were flying that night
3754250 there were 10 actual crash landings that night in west virginia
3754251 theyre all documented this is what took 17 years to figure out
3754252 i suppose if you went digging through some of these areas you might find something
3754253 i actually re drove and re enacted that whole night driving all through braxton county
3754254 there are readers who are as unethical as they come our purpose is to help people help themselves
3754255 and thats how we work everything all the modalities work together
3754256 its like a menu so that you can select from a wide variety were a menu of people with different styles
3754257 its a chance to try a lot of flavors with not a lot of risk
3754258 so peaceful and soothing its nice to take a moment just to let go of all those things we carry around all the time i feel great im all tingly
3754259 i thought i would discover a tomb that had already been looted probably a long time ago
3754260 instead i found myself opening the tomb for the first time in 2 200 years
3754261 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3754262 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3754263 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3754264 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3754265 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3754266 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3754267 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3754268 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3754269 she had blood spurting like crazy from her forehead and we were both all bloodied but she managed to tell me that she was ok and so i knew she was still conscious
3754270 we arrived at amang rodriquez at around 1 30 am and by then she was already unconscious and had lost so much blood
3754271 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3754272 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3754273 the more time it lags on the more we lose faith that this will ever come to an end
3754274 i thought we finally would get this behind us and move on
3754275 my mom keeps hanging on to the day she sees justice get served
3754276 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3754277 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3754278 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3754279 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3754280 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3754281 how can i admit my family is dealing with a drug problem when im trying to get a son or daughter married or into a good school
3754282 this person is an extension of myself and just as i am responsible for your safety and well being so is this person
3754283 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3754284 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3754285 i have to find out which one he was talking to

3754294 reading the piece i began to see the outlines of a grand cross ideological bargain conservatives get to deny obama the presidency and in return liberals get to call their fellow citizens racists for the next twenty years ill take the deal
3754295 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3754296 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3754297 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3754298 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3754299 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3754300 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3754301 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3754302 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3754303 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3754304 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3754305 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3754306 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3754307 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3754308 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3754309 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3754310 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3754311 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

3754316 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3754317 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3754318 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3754319 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3754320 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3754321 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3754322 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3754323 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3754324 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3754325 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3754326 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3754327 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3754363 after seeing the goldfish and the conditions in which they are being kept i felt compelled to share my disgust with my fellow fishkeepers
3754364 in this day and age the keeping of goldfish in unfiltered aquaria is totally unacceptible
3754365 filters are cheap and chearful and easy to use and i spend my life at work explaining to the general public why it is unethical to keep goldfish in such a way
3754366 how many people are going to see the big brother bowl and assume that what they are viewing is ok
3754367 the fish were purchased from a reputable pet shop and full guidelines on their care has been given to the housemates
3754368 we have also instructed the housemates that the water in the tank needs to be changed every few days and they have been provided with oxygenating tablets and water neutraliser again with full details of use in order to ensure the quality of the water the fish are living in
3754369 we can assure you that all necessary instruction has been passed on to ensure the health and continued well being of the goldfish
3754370 we did consult a number of sources regarding the care for the fish not just the place where it was purchased and much care has been taken to ensure that housemates understand their responsibility for looking after the fishs wellbeing as per the detailed instructions some of which have been included in your previous email rachel has been appointed fish feeder so that she can monitor and regulate their food

3754381 these expressions are not simply stereotypes intuitively associated with pride and shame but rather may be biologically innate behavioral responses to success and failure
3754382 ekman had established that expressions were the universal products of evolution
3754383 the potentially risky open posture associated with pride and nonhuman primate dominance displays may have originated as a way of conveying the validity of the individuals belief in his her dominance or success
3754384 likely originated as a way of conveying acceptance of an aggressors power thereby removing the need for conflict and sparing resources

3754448 first the survey was at an all time low in july second we have seen a 30 drop in oil prices so i would sense that there would be some relief expressed in surveys of financial professionals executives and the like

3754471 i went to wheatfields bakery in lawrence where we learned about various wheat flours head baker tom leonard demonstrated ancient methods of bread making including adding water to flour ground with a mortar and pestle to make flat breads
3754472 personally i never knew there were so many different types of wheat some of which are made into pastry others into bread or pasta i was amazed at the global importance of wheat and how much we export as a country
3754473 the way it has been edited and produced its really a heartwarming story i would definitely recommend it anyone who has any interest at all in wheat whether a producer or associated with the wheat industry should make plans to watch it
3754474 the market will try to gauge whether production prospects change during august and early september
3754475 the usdas weekly crop progress report indicated that crop condition ratings improved for corn and held about steady for soybeans during the week ended aug 10 both crops lag average maturity
3754476 only 30 percent of the corn crop was in the dough stage compared to the average of 50 percent and only 60 percent of the soybean crop was setting pods compared to the average of 75 percent in addition to average temperature and rainfall in august and early september production could be influenced by the occurrence of the first killing frost
3754477 in a separate report the usdas world agricultural outlook board increased the forecast of corn used for ethanol during the current marketing year by 50 million bushels and during the 2008 09 marketing year by 150 million bushels
3754478 exports during the current year are expected to reach 2 425 billion bushels 25 million less than projected last month
3754479 the projection of feed and residual use during the 2008 09 marketing year was increased by 100 million bushels stocks of corn on sept 1 are forecast at 1 576 billion 22 million below the july forecast while sept 1 2009 stocks are projected at 1 133 billion 300 million above last months forecast
3754480 there were also some changes in coarse grain production forecasts for other parts of the world
3754481 production prospects have declined for argentina but improved for canada mexico the european union russia and the ukraine coarse grain production outside the united states is forecast at a record 760 33 million metric tons nearly 5 percent larger than last years crop
3754482 the u s average yield potential is seen at 40 5 bushels 0 7 below the 2007 average and the lowest since 2003
3754483 yields are expected to be below the 2007 average in illinois and iowa but a bushel higher in indiana the projected crop of 2 973 billion bushels is 388 million larger than the 2007 harvest
3754484 soybean production in brazil in 2009 is forecast at 2 3 billion bushels 55 million less than forecast last month but 55 million more than produced this year
3754485 for argentina production is forecast at 1 82 billion bushels 55 million more than forecast in july and 110 million more than the 2008 harvest
3754486 it is bound to be the case there will be a quarter or two of negative growth
3754487 the committees forecasts for gdp growth now envisage the economy broadly stagnating over the next year or so
3754488 however there is a clear chance that the economy slows even more sharply than this business surveys are already warning of the danger that the economy actually contracts in the second half of the year
3754489 the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment to higher energy and commodity prices and in banking credit and housing markets
3754490 this adjustment to our economy cannot be avoided and as a result inflation is rising and growth is slowing
3754491 while we would not rule out a cut in british rates in november particularly if the economy slows markedly further and oil prices continue to retreat we are maintaining our view that interest rates will stay at 5 00 percent until early 2009
3754492 however we then expect interest rates to come down markedly in 2009 to 4 25 percent by mid 2009 and to 3 75 percent by the fourth quarter of next year

3754520 in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone
3754521 i would hope that my friend obamas republican rival john mccain would join me in condemning this kind of politics

3754545 i definitely have a couple superstitions i like to tie my skates the same way and i like to tape my socks and tape my stick the same way but i try to avoid the superstitions as i think they just get in the way
3754546 i definitely have a couple and i stick by them but i try not to get into too many of them
3754547 im pretty serious about my sticks if someone touches them i have to untape them and put them back i usually freak out if anyone touches them but thats pretty much my only thing
3754548 im a pretty superstitious guy when it comes to how the team is doing or how im doing
3754549 i take a pre game nap and listen to the same two songs on my ipod before my nap and before every game thats something ive been doing since i came to the ohl i can remember this year our team had lost four or five games in a row so a couple of us bleached our hair just to change up our luck and we went on a four game winning streak so just little things like that whether its doing something with my hair changing the color of the tape on my stick just little things i know they might not mean much to the normal person but im a pretty superstitious guy so i definitely think about that stuff
3754550 well usually before every game i do the exact same routine every single day
3754551 theres not really anything special i put my equipment on the exact same way every time the exact same time i switched it up a bit this year just because i had a rough start to the year so i kind of switched things up hoping it would change my luck but nothing really too special
3754552 i used to be really superstitious if i said something weird in my head during the game i would knock on my stick because everyone says you have to knock on wood or something like that
3754553 thats another thing i learned from carey price just go out there and play your game and you dont think about it too much nowadays i dont really have many superstitions when it comes to being on the ice or getting ready or stuff i just go through my normal routine and get stretched out and stuff
3754554 i fly by the seat of my pants i guess
3754555 i dont have anything really that crazy about me i usually eat pre game at the same time and shower at the same time before every game other than that i just get dressed and play

3754596 the downward revision in the panels gdp growth outlook to 7 7 percent in fy09 is in line with our view that growth will moderate this year

3754637 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3754638 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression

3754669 this is in the national interest it is the image of our national music national culture especially the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important extremely serious matter
3754670 we made the decision that the voice we would use was yang peiyis the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3754671 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in the aspect of voice yang peiyi is flawless
3754672 we had been through several inspections they were all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were spectators from various divisions especially a leader from the politburo who gave us his opinion it must change
3754673 i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi that is to say we have a perfect voice and a perfect image and representation in our teams view combined together
3754674 adults may lie but leave the kids out of it
3754675 if i could only complete one of these but not both which one would i choose
3754676 after trying achieve planner for nearly two months i can honestly say that it has revolutionized the way i work i have an incredibly busy schedule so i need something that can cope with a multitude of tasks projects and appointments whilst at the same time keeping me focused on what is most important achieve planner does all of this and much more besides over the years ive tried pretty much every system on the market and nothing absolutely nothing comes anywhere close to this it looks great works superbly comes with excellent instructions is a pleasure to use but most important of all it really works for anyone who wants to get organized and take their productivity to the next level achieve planner is an absolute must its one piece of software that im certain ill be using for many years to come
3754677 i just wanted to thank you for writing such a useful program i use it daily to record my thoughts which i later review as i write my poetry the easy reviewing of my previous thoughts from other days has alleviated much of the writers block i experienced in the past thanks again for the great software
3754678 contrary to our predictions based on shorter follow up the absolute difference in cumulative incidence of distant metastasis and prostate cancer death did not further increase after 7 years of follow up
3754679 in settings with a large proportion of psa detected tumors the relative reduction in risk of death following radical prostatectomy might be somewhat larger or similar to that in our study but the absolute reduction would be smaller
3754680 these results demonstrate that among men younger than 65 years whose prostate cancer is detected by methods other than psa testing eg due to a digital rectal examination to evaluate uri nary or other symptoms cure with radical prostatectomy is possi ble may be necessary and should generally be recommended

3754688 this number is an important reminder for physicians and patients that antibiotics can have serious side effects and should only be taken when necessary
3754689 for conditions in which antibiotics have questionable benefit such as many mild upper respiratory tract infections weighing the benefits of antibiotics with the risks of a serious adverse event will be especially important
3754690 because antibiotics are frequently used both appropriately and inappropriately if doctors would reduce the number of antibiotics they prescribe to their patients by even a small percentage we could significantly reduce the number of emergency visits for antibiotic adverse events physicians need to communicate to their patients that antibiotics are not harmless
3754691 in conclusion this study demonstrates that patients with early stage breast cancer who are disease free at five years after adjuvant systemic therapy have a substantially increased residual risk of recurrence
3754692 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours
3754693 there is potential that this continuing research will have huge clinical implications
3754694 if we can define the mechanism for recovery the translation of these findings to the clinic will dictate how much massage is needed for how long and when it should be performed after exercise
3754695 we tried to mimic swedish massage because anecdotally its the most popular technique used by athletes
3754696 a review of the research in this area shows that despite the existing anecdotal evidence we know athletes use massage all the time researchers dont know the mechanism of how massage improves recovery after exercise and injury
3754697 its hard to describe exactly how the exercise intensity would be matched in a human but this was considered a significant amount of exercise that would likely cause muscle soreness and possible damage
3754698 we know biological tissues are sensitive to the magnitude of frequency duration and load so we controlled the force frequency and time spent on massage
3754699 one fundamental question is how much of a role does inflammation play in repair to a muscle are we preventing inflammation and therefore improving recovery we havent proven that yet
3754700 our goal is to use this model to understand the biological mechanisms of massage as a guide to preclinical trials to test the effects of massage on muscle recovery after exercise
3754701 a trial in humans could look at optimal indications for massage
3754702 some early life exposures such as maternal smoking during pregnancy or personal characteristics may impair the development of physical control and coordination as well as increasing the risk of obesity in later life
3754703 would you just stop babbling for one minute so i can think of she was growing more and more weary of the little bug every moment that she hung around
3754704 i will have you know butterflies do not babble we talk of love and happiness and truth and maybe that is too much for your little brain to handle
3754705 if you would only hear me instead of merely listening you would see that i have already solved your little problem but i guess i dont know what to tell you
3754706 i am totally confused lost and hungry and the only thing that knows how to help me seems to be perpetually stoned all the time
3754707 i dont want to be a bother dear but who is stoned and where can i find them
3754708 stop eating those so we can have a real conversation would you
3754709 why dont you just go away i am a lost cause you know
3754710 i know you are but i cant ever go away we are bound forever you and i the answer is in a riddle i cant figure out but it has something to do with reason and time
3754711 maybe if you tell it to me i can help you figure it out and then you can be free
3754712 millions are coming here today from something that came yesterday and together they shall cleave for all eternity
3754713 that is because my dear it is an unsolvable riddle you see
3754714 you are correct but i can only remember that half of the riddle so it remains unsolvable to you and me
3754715 by the way that is not unsolvable its stupid and stop talking in rhyme its giving me a headache
3754716 nothing is stupid except humans without you dont follow me or ill swat you dumb butterfly
3754717 well now that you are a man you neednt be afraid of whats out here look at you must be six and a half feet tall and atleast four feet wide what is your name

3754736 the fairy said that i could just call for you and you would appear to me
3754737 at this very instant i need to be elsewhere and you are keeping me from that what is so important that you had to call apon me now child
3754738 this is not getting to the point child i have many other things i need to do so what do you want

3754934 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy
3754935 we are overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and love from isaacs dear friends colleagues and fans from every corner of the world and we thank each and every one of them for their kind thoughts and prayers

3754941 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since ive been here theyve tested me four times and they took blood a lot of blood

3754944 its no different its just another swim meet its just another race im going to have

3754948 i knew chen was special at the first sight of the girl when she was eight years old
3754949 her body structure seemed perfectly suited for weightlifting even then she could pull a cart loaded with 150 kg of sugar cane alone
3754950 a time when to be different was to be damned
3754951 youll be begging for a body bag if it means a ride home
3754952 i would like to think these numbers are smaller than women think they are
3754953 remain terrified they are going to relapse i think the message for women is the risk may not be as large as they think
3754954 women who had er positive cancer were more likely to have late recurrences than those with er negative
3754955 estrogen receptor status is a tumor marker we look at
3754956 we know that those who have er positive tumors have cancers that are responsive to the effects of estrogen
3754957 the major message is that even though women may have gone through five years of hormonal therapy they are still at risk of relapse
3754958 basically the jury is out on the potential value of additional treatment strategies once the five years is completed
3754959 based on this study we need to be open to question whether other treatment programs may be appropriate in some of these women after the five year period is completed

3754970 my self esteem is no longer built into having a perfect body although i have the same hang ups as many other women
3754971 at the moment im a bit curvier having done the tour so it was big mental step forward for me to show my natural self rather than my worked out honed self
3754972 i definitely have commitment issues it is lovely to be somebody and find a connection and by intimate and open that is wonderful but i have learnt there are also minuses
3754973 i love being in love but i can be fickle one minute i think somebody is the love of my life and the next i dont i blow hot and cold
3754974 hes like what is the matter with you im like i dont know but i like it ive always liked things that are meant to terrify
3754975 when i was a kid i used to watch this vampire soap opera dark shadows i loved that show and i was little i can remember my sister going into the other room to fold laundry with my mother because she was so frightened i guess it has translated into the material i want to do as an adult
3754976 people ask all the time if sex scenes and nudity are hard whats hard
3754977 there wasnt a period in my life like serena went through where i was doing drugs and having sex with my best friends boyfriend
3754978 i was class president on the cheerleading squad in a competitive show choir and in like six different clubs
3754979 things are slowly starting to get back on track jo knows the affair was based on vodka
3754980 i love my wife but i have a girlfriend and i love her too
3754981 but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them
3754982 the democratic leadership has got to listen to the people on this issue

3754990 although im not a marketing major i have a bit of a trusted reputation after 18 years self promoting id like to inform you i had no say in this marketing campaign but if i did things would be different since it is obvious that this poster is boring odd and has zero to do with the movie i performed in
3754991 granted one poster stinking up the joint isnt the end of the world yet it sends the wrong message about our movie and i just wanted you to know that i feel the pain i really love the film and i know from past missteps marketing wise that the wrong poster sends the wrong audience into the theater
3754992 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved

3754994 this is august 7 this is my birthday and im taking a bath in the sink at burger king
3754995 any bacteria on his skin could have been deposited giving people food poisoning
3754996 we have sanitized the sink and have disposed of all other kitchen tools and utensils that were used during the incident
3754997 we have also taken appropriate corrective action on the employees that were involved in this video
3754998 he kept taking pictures of his face next to girls bare bottoms
3754999 precipitated a horrendously tragic event which has impacted many individuals

3755001 how many people can you find who have a good heart to help other people in this world
3755002 we could see there were people inside but there was nothing you could do it was horrible
3755003 one hundred feet in either direction and he could have hit some cars
3755004 i hope one day that things will be back to normal
3755005 i would love to be able to sit up and watch television with him after the kids have gone to bed i guess i can keep hoping and praying
3755006 they were good neighbors and it was just a tragic loss
3755007 it was really a brand new plane if there were any problems it wouldnt have been cleared to fly
3755008 he was the kind of guy you could go to when you had a question about process or procedure
3755009 he was someone who worshipped the process and followed the rules he had opinions but he put the process above anything else
3755010 he was a guy who was public spirited and public minded
3755011 regardless of which side of the issue people were on they all respected joe
3755012 i think hes crashed his altitude went up down up down and then he disappeared off the radar at really low altitude
3755013 people rushed over and tried to help but it was just too late the flames were too intense
3755014 we ran outside we saw the flames and the smoke and we could just see the tail of the plane
3755015 the people hired in an improper way did not themselves do anything wrong it therefore would be unfair and quite possibly illegal given their civil service protections to fire or reassign them without individual cause
3755016 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3755017 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3755018 it would have ill served the public interest not to appoint him merely because those who first hired him had violated the civil service laws

3755080 any award named after mahatma gandhi should only be conferred on an institution or a person dedicated to gandhian principles but the award conferred on an organisation allied to the rss raises doubts on the intentions of the government already working on saffron agenda it is an insult to gandhi
3755081 it was unfortunate and biggest injustice done by this government in the name of gandhi it was also a direct attack on gandhian principles
3755082 fire eagle is a way for people to take their location to the web
3755083 essentially fire eagle is nothing more nothing less than a store for a users location
3755084 whats more interesting is how it works as a switchboard
3755085 fire eagle solved all the hard problems with location for us
3755086 it makes it easier for bloggers to have correct location information on their blog within their posts being able to geo tag their content
3755087 obviously fire eagle is crucial to the success of what were trying to do
3755088 there are other tools that identify location but none that do it in specifically this way
3755089 the attention to privacy is noteworthy as is the concept behind fire eagle the challenge will be to build user awareness and adoption in the near term

3755092 a bunch of youth groups posted something that was almost a manifesto that called on supporter to wage an information war against georgia
3755093 in the ongoing russian versus georgia cyberwar we have an indication of lists of georgian governmental sites actively distributed across russian web forums
3755094 by posting on blogs and forums instructions that essentially say this is what were going to do but we dont know whos behind that
3755095 georgian hackers or pro georgian hackers launched distributed denial of service attacks against ria novosti
3755096 especially in russia every time something happens there are attacks name any crisis there in the past year and i can point to a spike in attack traffic
3755097 countries visionary enough in the long term sort of tolerate hacking activities unless of course they target the countrys infrastructure in order for the country to later on mobilize them based on nationalist sentiments
3755098 what the attackers learned is that security researchers are actively monitoring their conversations and so in the russo georgia campaign the conversation wasnt happening at the usual underground corners but rather on mainstream forums
3755099 theyve also learned how to better utilize the masses to participate in the attack and that combination of tactics would improve the quality of the campaign
3755100 anyone picking a political fight with russia today can now expect to deal with multiple forms and sources of electronic attack not only from the russian military but also from the russian governments unofficial civilian hacker assets

3755205 our members are facing the reality of a 5 inflation rate and soaring energy and food bills and if tube lines wants to avoid a crippling strike it should get back around the table with an offer that meets their needs

3755237 we hear that the applicants for placement will have to appear for an entrance test i think the test will be about government policies both students and teachers alike are still confused
3755238 after i graduated from the medical institute in 1967 and applied for placement i had to appear for a test on the socialist programme but after 1988 students did not have to appear for the test but now we are again hearing that there will be a test
3755239 during our time the government used to announce it in the state newspapers but now it seems that only people who are close know about it some just dont know about it but when they do know it is sometimes too late

3755242 the olympic viewer will be able to define his or her own olympic experience like never before

3755293 we are very much opposed to it and the timing couldnt be worse
3755294 all media are in full steep ad slowdown and at the same time media companies are diversifying online
3755295 surging revenues and audiences online are what local media companies are about its not just a bolt on its intrinsic to business
3755296 if the bbc comes in now it would be very damaging for the sector the point is there is no need there is no market failure
3755297 it is a major development of the bbcs activities which will compete direct with our members operations in a harmful fashion
3755298 this service will ultimately be offered across every bbc platform and will therefore be in direct competition with every facet of any regional media companys multimedia portfolio whether mobile website or broadcast
3755299 what is surprising is the depth of concern in our industry we would like them bbc trust not to go ahead with the plans
3755300 we think our evidence and more particularly the evidence from our members shows to the bbc trust what an adverse effect it would have there is no public value
3755301 we have already listened carefully and have put in place a number of safeguards to manage any negative impact this includes excluding content which drives revenue for local papers such as listings jobs and singles dating limiting video content to the 60 areas the bbc already provides local news and rolling out the proposal slowly allowing the market time to plan
3755302 weve also thought about how the service might help commercial media by proposing that other local video news providers could supplement their content with the bbcs local video and by extending our existing links to websites such as those of local newspapers

3755307 every media company will be affected in the downturn some are structurally doomed to be blunt others are cyclically challenged
3755308 to survive media companies have to make no acquisitions pay great care and attention to their core products and ensure they have solid banking relationships then they have to take a realistic rather than an overly optimistic view of just how long this is going to last
3755309 we feel the star is paying the price for johnston presss greedy spending spree over the last few years and bad decisions taken by senior management
3755310 the company relies on the goodwill loyalty and dedication of its staff who earn meagre salaries well below the national average wage
3755311 our staff have put in many dedicated years of service around the clock and this is how they are repaid

3755317 theres a lot of interest in mansfield as its such an unusual thing for us
3755318 theres talk of giving her the freedom of the district and therell be quite a lot of celebrating when she comes back
3755319 we know a lot of publishers are doing nothing with their international eyeballs or are using one ad network
3755320 our proposition is based around the better monetisation of 1000 ads currently for many publishers that can be less than 1 0 52 we promise face to face to improve that maybe by 10 times 20 times or even 50 times
3755321 we are there to help the transition from print to digital
3755322 publishers cant just expect digital to be the white knight that will come along and save them and some of the publishers we are speaking to do expect that publishers need to understand digital better they need to understand what digital advertisers need and invest heavily in their digital output they are well on the road but by their own admission they are by no means there
3755323 theres a great pc world down the road to help when the blackberry breaks and what else would i need

3755326 this is new and there will be bumps i dont expect it to be all puppy dogs and ice cream but with chris i can have a grown up value based discussion
3755327 the printing press in upper mounts in northampton is used by 39 other johnston press titles printing more than one million copies a week
3755328 following a detailed review of the printing press operations within johnston press it is proposed to close the printing operation in northampton and to reduce the printing operation in peterborough
3755329 in the event this proposal goes ahead the company will endeavour to minimise the impact of the proposal through voluntary redundancy and by re deployment to alternative positions within the company and the jp group
3755330 as well as enabling efficiency gains to be realised across the group these proposals also mark a significant strategic shift in our publishing strategy
3755331 the company remains totally committed to providing readers with highly relevant local content delivered in a range of print and digital formats when and where they want it and these proposals are consistent with this objective

3755342 it was just political everybody closes up before the olympic games i was just shut out of their system suddenly and unexpectedly and it was highly irritating
3755343 i thought i could fight through it and i did mentally i felt ready and i felt prepared and then i just sucked in the last three minutes what can i say
3755344 in the beginning it was positive emotion but it was too much
3755345 i tried to say please take it easy but its not easy to say hey dont fence so strong or so much take it easy
3755346 i know no canadian taxpayer wants to hear that i really did try my best and i really did give everything i have
3755347 but i swear to all of you that i really did and im very sorry that i didnt bring home a medal but you train and you take your chances

3755350 the us patent and trademark office may have a major problem on its hands the possibly unconstitutional appointment of nearly two thirds of its patent appeals judges such a constitutional flaw if legitimate could call into question the hundreds of decisions worth billions of dollars in the past eight years the flaw discovered by highly regarded intellectual property scholar john duffy of george washington university law school could also afflict the appointment of nearly half of the agencys trademark appeals judges

3755355 system is supposed to be designed to encourage the innovative
3755356 the apparent death of googles pioneering pagerank patent under the ptos new rule for patentable subject matter may be a cause for celebration among those who are philosophically opposed to property rights in innovation and are eager to confine the patent systems ambit
3755357 it will surely be cause for mourning among those who believe that allowing patents on cutting edge technologies has served the country well for more than two centuries and that a radical departure from the traditional approach would be unwise
3755358 there is no signature yet but we hope to get it shortly we have been following him for a year and we have an agreement with his agent

3755367 thus the covenant that god made with the jewish people through moses remains eternally valid for them
3755368 to the jewish people whom god first chose to hear his word belong the sonship the glory the covenants the giving of the law the worship and the promises to them belong the patriarchs and of their race according to the flesh is the christ
3755369 catholics understand that all previous covenants that god made with the jewish people have been fulfilled in jesus christ through the new covenant established through his sacrificial death on the cross
3755370 might be understood to imply that one of the former covenants imparts salvation without the mediation of christ whom christians believe to be the universal savior of all people
3755371 the catechism is not the place where you work out difficult theological problems
3755372 are in a real relationship with god based on a covenant that has never been revoked
3755373 all covenants with israel find fulfillment in christ who is the savior of all
3755374 it is also the churchs understanding that the full incorporation of israel into the saving covenant of christ may be the fruit of the end times may not happen until the end of history

3755383 regretfully the proposals put at risk of redundancy up to 30 posts in these areas and we have started the consultation process directly with those affected as well as through their representatives
3755384 every effort will be made to minimise the impact of these proposals on those at risk of redundancy including voluntary severance and redeployment
3755385 environmental conditions appear somewhat conducive for development and a tropical depression may form during the next day or two as the system moves west northwest at 10 to 15 mph
3755386 environmental conditions continue to appear that they will be favorable for development for the next few days
3755387 all indications are that this system will continue to have problems developing today and possibly even on thursday however by thursday and especially on friday the wave will move into an area of strong high pressure and begin heading west as the track model guidance suggests
3755388 if this disturbance maintains its circulation i think we will see the disturbance gaining organization on friday and continuing through this weekend as it turns west under the ridge of high pressure
3755389 it is not out of the question to see a strong tropical storm or a minimal hurricane near the southeastern bahamas by late sunday all interests in the bahamas and in florida should keep a very close eye on this system
3755390 the manifestation of demons can be very frightening but you never have to be afraid of the devil because we always have the power of christ to deal with him
3755391 i find it very satisfying i wouldnt use the word pride because pride is something from the devil and the way you can actually do this is kind of work is to be very humble
3755392 and hes not actually bringing anything out and dusting it off its always been there maybe less practiced than it could be or should be but right now he sees that theres a greater need for it
3755393 in a better position than in all of history to discern and determine what is spiritual and whats not spiritual
3755394 when a society doesnt believe in demons it therefore doesnt believe in exorcism so its really only people of faith who will understand this for what it is

3755399 bt is developing semantic technology able to interrogate a range of databases through a single search query bt is already using this tech in its sales and billing departments and plans to roll it out to its business customers in the near future
3755400 semantic integration represents a specialized field of practice dedicated to using semantic design principles methodologies and technology as a facilitating mechanism often alongside soa to help solve enterprise level problems for it
3755401 represents a structure that expresses both a hierarchy and a set of relationships between vocabulary elements within that hierarchy
3755402 its nice to be in the hat for a start
3755403 overall im delighted there was huge disappointment after saturday expectancy levels have risen through the roof

3755405 two goals in two minutes for us killed the tie off
3755406 i was pleased with the overall work ethic if you into a game like this and feel you can play in second gear youre going to get punished as weve found to our cost in previous seasons
3755407 binary assumptions about women and men are not reflected upon or the gender politics of a particular domain is ignored thus the existing structural symbolic gender order is inscribed into computational artifacts and will be reproduced by their use
3755408 minority views quieter voices and allows the dominant voice to speak for everyone which seems highly problematic
3755409 that the perspectives i tried to sketch here can contribute to build better semantic systems or even prevent them from failure in function or on the marketplace
3755410 with the use of the internet we are already witnessing a radical change in practices of how knowledge is represented stored and spread
3755411 alison adam analyzed the well known ontology cyc she revealed that the knowing subject implicitly assumed by the system is a white middle class male professional
3755412 values other than male and female may be used but are not enumerated here the foaf gender mechanism is not intended to capture the full variety of biological social and sexual concepts associated with the word gender
3755413 linked open data is the web done as it should be
3755414 imagine writes nowack you are looking for a job in california at a company that is at a specific funding stage crunchbase knows everything about companies investments and has structured location data crunchboard on the other hand has job descriptions but only a single field for city and state and not the filter options to match our needs
3755415 this is where linked data shines if we find a way to link from crunchboard to crunchbase we can use semantic web technology to run queries that include both sources and with sparqlscript we can construct and leverage these links below is a script that first loads the crunchboard feed of current job offers only the last 15 entries due to common rss limitations practices the use of e g hatom could allow more data to be pulled in in a second step it uses the company name to establish a pattern join between crunchboard and crunchbase which then allows us to retrieve the list of matching jobs at stage a companies with offices in california
3755416 weve really seen the emergence of semantic web from the research lab were just on the cusp of r amp d to a range of real world applications
3755417 semantic web has been around for a while now a lot of work has been done on the building blocks
3755418 it is a difficult task to go back to ages by gone to divest ourselves of what we know and are and form a clear conception of generations that have been of their experiences objects modes of life thought and expression

3755446 i was hoping for a top 10 or top 15 finish so i would get an autographed hat from the king

3755448 its tough getting into someone elses a little uncomfortable without any real practice
3755449 you just dont drive it like you drive your own car at least i didnt i was about half the boris sunday i just drove a conservative race and brought them home a consistent finish with some points
3755450 if it were my car i would have definitely been more aggressive overall it was a fun day not a mark on the car
3755451 accusing me is like accusing me of killing my mother
3755452 thats disgusting that is an insult i didnt attack her i didnt stab her i didnt kill her
3755453 i was disgusted in myself why would i kill someone because i failed an exam i was to blame for it what is that gonna solve

3755456 it would be fair to say people were expecting more editorial cuts than they johnston press have put forward
3755457 so far we havent really seen any staffers being targeted its mainly casuals some of them long term casuals who are going to be given a package to go
3755458 nobody delivers news in a way thats adapted to how young people consume media
3755459 just remember fans take losses much harder than the majority of players do

3755467 the problem was that he did not disclose his association with the case that seems like pertinent information the fact that almost every other site reporting on this matter do not disclose this and position duffy as totally unbiased to this issue is telling
3755468 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3755469 who is this guy and what is his affilitation with the issue s
3755470 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3755471 really you honestly think that theres no ethical questions in not disclosing a conflict of interest i just dont see how that is perhaps its because i deal with plenty of writers who know that the most fundamental point is to disclose any potential conflicts
3755472 well our intended audience should know were biased so we dont need to disclose conflicts of interest
3755473 well our intended audience should know were biased so we dont need to disclose conflicts of interest

3755476 the pto s new interpretation of patentable subject matter provides a clear avenue to reject patent applications and to invalid issued patents on all patents on innovative computer implemented processes without regard to how meritorious or creative the innovation is
3755477 duffy pointed to googles pagerank patent or license rather because google is considered a great innovator and the pagerank system is considered truly inventive and unique to google duffy was not using googles name for recognition purposes he was using googles patent as an example of something deserving patent protection
3755478 actually its not most of the truly unique work for pagerank was done prior to page brins work by jon kleinberg at mit page brin simply updated his work in a rather marginal way
3755479 well if most of our readers know this conflict theres no reason to disclose

3755520 one might be tempted to dismiss the importance of the colbert bump because it is just money
3755521 we placed our participants in an fmri scanner to measure their brain activity while we first showed our subject short 3s movie clips of an actor sipping from a cup and then looking disgusted
3755522 later on we asked them to read and imagine short emotional scenarios for instance walking along a street bumping into a reeking drunken man who then starts to retch and realizing that some of his vomit had ended up in your own mouth finally we measured their brain activity while the participants tasted unpleasant solutions in the scanner
3755523 is that in all three cases the same location of the anterior insula lit up the anterior insula is the part of the brain that is the heart of our feeling of disgust patients who have damage to the insula because of a brain infection for instance lose this capacity to feel disgusted if you give them sour milk they would drink it happily and say it tastes like soda
3755524 what this means is that whether we see a movie or read a story the same thing happens we activate our bodily representations of what it feels like to be disgusted
3755525 you should always try to camp with at least one partner so if someone gets hurt the other person can help

3755527 sharks have shaped evolution in our oceans for 450 million years and their diminishment has already been the cause of severe damage to global oceanic eco systems shark species extinctions will cause irreparable damage
3755528 if we cant save the sharks we will fail to save our oceans and if our oceans die civilization and humanity will die lush and sea shepherd recognize that we need to save the sharks if we are to save ourselves and we are working together to make this happen
3755529 lush are a campaigning company and we have already tackled issues such as animal testing and over packaging but with 100 million sharks being killed every year and time fast running out for the remaining 10 of the global shark population the campaign against shark finning and longlining is perhaps our biggest challenge yet
3755530 lush have over 550 stores in more than 50 countries and we will be campaigning on this issue in all of them but the nature of the global campaign very much depends on the decision made by the dpi amp f in australia next month if it goes against the sharks we know who the target of our campaign will be
3755531 the proposed inshore fin fishery for sharks is completely illogical we know nothing about the basic biology of these animals their growth rates reproductive cycles and movement patterns it is the equivalent of pulling a person off the street and making them fly a plane without a manual its a guaranteed disaster
3755532 though decades of economic research suggest men and women are equalizing in the labor market the notion that todays working women are being paid more and treated better than ever before is simply wrong
3755533 the growing equality between genders reflects the entry of the most able women to the workforce rather than better pay while there may be more women holding high power positions today they are still being paid as their counterparts were three decades ago

3755539 with all of the mixed messages we hear about biofuels there is a clear need for a standard that can differentiate the good from the bad
3755540 for an issue of such seminal importance it was necessary to bring many different stakeholder groups together to agree on how to define and measure sustainable biofuels
3755541 ensuring sustainability is what all these discussions are hinged upon
3755542 biofuels are one of a number of potential alternatives to fossil fuels and todays agreement allows us to initiate a stakeholder driven process that will determine their value right across the production process from field or forest to tank
3755543 we should be celebrating and restoring these special places not spreading poison across them after years of making prairie dog recovery a priority the forest service is doing a complete 180 degree about face

3755548 asphalt has a lot of advantages as a solar collector
3755549 for one blacktop stays hot and could continue to generate energy after the sun goes down unlike traditional solar electric cells in addition there is already a massive acreage of installed roads and parking lots that could be retrofitted for energy generation so there is no need to find additional land for solar farms roads and lots are typically resurfaced every 10 to 12 years and the retrofit could be built into that cycle extracting heat from asphalt could cool it reducing the urban heat island effect finally unlike roof top solar arrays which some find unattractive the solar collectors in roads and parking lots would be invisible

3755551 we found that the oil and gas blocks overlap perfectly with the most biodiverse part of the amazon for birds mammals and amphibians
3755552 the threat to amphibians is of particular concern because they are already the most threatened group of vertebrates worldwide
3755553 the most dynamic situation is unfolding in the peruvian amazon
3755554 the elimination of new oil access roads could significantly reduce the impacts of most projects
3755555 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3755556 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognize that indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent
3755557 filling up with a tank of gas could soon have devastating consequences to rainforests their peoples and their species
3755558 greenpeace demands that kimberly clark stop wiping away our treasured ancient forests to make disposable products like tissue and toilet paper
3755559 greenpeace is here to directly communicate with kimberly clark employees so they can encourage their companys leadership to stop using endangered forests such as the boreal to make products that are used once and then thrown away
3755560 kimberly clark is not taking the interests of the green consumer seriously
3755561 people who care about the environment do not want toilet paper that helps destroy caribou habitat and bird nesting sites instead kimberly clark should increase the post consumer recycled content of its paper products

3755564 but i just want to start something else if i dont i wont live long enough to complete all the projects in that pile over there
3755565 you vowed to finish this stuff not put it in that trunk labeled yarn projects
3755566 i wonder what i was going to do with this
3755567 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3755568 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3755569 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3755570 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
3755571 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
3755572 instructions are being developed and being sent to boards of election across the state to make sure voting is consistent
3755573 there is no question that the huge effort to register and turn out voters at ohio state university is going to have a positive impact on our race
3755574 going after your opponent for being of the world seemed a bit jarring a bit odd
3755575 their campaign really seems pretty out of touch with what the american people want to see and hear during the olympics
3755576 theyre using a gigantic stage to make their national case against obama
3755577 it doesnt seem to be causing any uproar they may have guessed right

3755583 republicans have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas
3755584 well we can do that we can have a vote on that but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them
3755585 being seen as in the pockets of big oil is not where you want to be as a candidate
3755586 i do believe that its a seismic event in congress
3755587 and everyone in washington has taken notice it certainly could be a harbinger of things to come
3755588 while east tennesseans have been struggling with out of control gas prices
3755589 david davis has pocketed thousands from oil companies why is big oil trying to buy our seat in congress and why is davis accepting their cash
3755590 you would think that in a republican primary attacking your opponent as a fan of big business would not work
3755591 but the proof as they say is in the pudding
3755592 it was a way to cue people into the differences between the candidates over influence and money
3755593 to say the election was a referendum on big oil i would say is a stretch
3755594 the republicans are vulnerable to the charge that this move will enrich the oil companies but have no discernible impact on prices
3755595 but in the end i think the republicans will win this one obama has already softened his stance on the issue and many democrats in congress will go along i think we are in store for more drilling no matter what happens
3755596 the last time it was this bad was before my time i started in the early 1990s and i imagine that in edinburgh probably the last time it was as bad as this was before that
3755597 its difficult to predict whats going to happen im not expecting very much to happen this year and i imagine that we could be looking into some time next year before we get back to normality
3755598 even then were not going to see these premium edinburgh prices
3755599 borrowing is a problem and first time buyers are finding it difficult theyre having to find bigger deposits and dont have resources and the investors are disappearing

3755602 i was going to put it on the market last august but i had someone say theyd like to rent it out for six months so i held off
3755603 it turned out to be a really stupid idea because the property market collapsed
3755604 its been on the market for two months now whereas this time last year i think it would have sold in about a week

3755617 if you are not working with natural assistance you cause untold problems which become very expensive and very difficult to undo it places impossible burdens on nature and leads to accumulating problems which become more difficult to sort out
3755618 why else are we facing all these challenges climate change and everything
3755619 absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3755620 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3755621 if they think this is the way to go we end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness

3755653 the global models are good for investigating whats likely to happen on a planetary scale but the resolution is quite coarse when looking at a more localised regional scale
3755654 its a bit like enlarging a digital photograph until it becomes pixellated and all sorts of detail is blurred out
3755655 simulating the climate of the region is a challenge for climate models due in part to the high natural inter annual variability the topography of the region which includes multiple mountain ranges and inland seas and the presence of a slight cooling trend in recent decades despite the global trend being a warming
3755656 we need to confirm this result with other models but a 50 per cent increase in rainfall in such an important agricultural area is a much more hopeful scenario than a 15 per cent decline
3755657 thats why we tend to see renewables come into play with the legislation passed
3755658 in a traditional environment without renewables most utilities opt for the lowest cost approach because thats how theyre regulated
3755659 if we deployed it widescale it would be four to five times higher than coal
3755660 baby bells tried to keep cell phones off their networks
3755661 eventually they bought up the cell phone companies the economics of distributed energy do not really allow for a defensive strategy to work very long
3755662 its not a matter of if its going to take off its when its going to take off
3755663 yeah we have a few clouds in the southeast but everybody in the southeast knows theres very good potential in the southeast the fact is countries like germany and japan with much less solar incidence are building solar plants
3755664 the polar regions are barometers of change for the climate of the earth as a whole the 19 million square kilometers of sea ice that form each winter had been a blind spot so far and the seals help us fill in that part of the story
3755665 animals that carry tags are just as good at foraging just as good at catching food as animals without them
3755666 longer term they have just the same sort of survival rates as animals that dont carry them so theres no effect on the seals and the few seals that are out there collecting this data are doing an enormous service if you like to broader science and also to their own species

3755688 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
3755689 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
3755690 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero

3755749 a pay budget cut is being implemented in a context where the institutes have effectively had no new posts sanctioned for many years
3755750 the capacity for further efficiencies is severely limited the higher education authority hea has told all the institutes that all possible pay and non pay efficiency measures which can yield savings beyond the 3pc announced by the government should be identified
3755751 the hea has also stated that it seems likely that

3755754 the institutes of technology ireland are also dismayed that while the student services fee is being increased this year from 825 to 900 75pc of the increased revenue is being clawed back by the department

3755905 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3755906 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3755907 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3755908 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3755983 russias attack on neighboring georgia over two tiny separatist provinces is really about something much bigger russian leader vladimir putins desire to restore the former ussrs might russias ill intentions clearly are on display in georgia in a fit of nationalist fury it wants to teach georgia and other former satellite countries that once made up the soviet bloc that its pro western rapprochement days are over what better way than to invade a former republic humiliate its leaders and then taunt the west for failing to come to its aid as if that wasnt enough russia immediately began threatening its other neighbors a top russian diplomat ominously warned monday that latvia estonia lithuania and poland would pay for criticizing russias imperialist policy toward georgia russias claim to support independence from georgia of tiny south ossetia and even tinier abkhazia is simply phony georgia with its strategically important oil pipeline has grown close to the u s even sending troops to iraq putin furious at growing u s and nato ties with eastern europe wanted to emasculate georgias military while deposing its pro american president mikheil saakashvili with his attack it looks like hes succeeding the symbolism of the invasion coming at the start of the beijing olympics is unmistakable this is russias wake up call to all of us communism may be dead putin is saying but russia isnt
3755984 if we had a stronger relationship with russia we could exercise strong diplomacy to stop this effort against georgia we should immediately go to the united nations security council condemn russias action and then get the security council to pass a strong resolution getting the russians to show some restraint
3755985 we should continue to push for a united nations security council resolution calling for an immediate end to the violence its a clear violation of the sovereignty and internationally recognized borders of georgia
3755986 barack obamas goal was to be tough and smart and so when the russian action happened on thursday he immediately called for a ceasefire condemned the unwarranted use of force by russia it was a bad crisis for the world it required tough words but also a smart approach to call on the international community to step in and im very very happy that the senators request for a ceasefire has been complied with by russian president dmitry medvedev

3755990 to pretend we can ever get hold of this without dealing with that the idea of unprotected sexual relations with unlimited numbers of partners i think would be naive

3755993 remember there is such a thing as good and evil
3755994 the best defense against usurpatory government is an assertive citizenry
3755995 its easy being a humorist when youve got the whole government working for you
3755996 heres the record when it comes to georgia obama on learning of the soviet invasion played it cool it was important for all sides to show restraint mccain by contrast demanded that russia immediately and unconditionally pull its forces out of georgia mccain understood the stakes in the affair does obama understand
3755997 georgia whose desire for nato membership had u s support is not in nato because some prospective members of mccains league of democracies e g germany thought that starting membership talks with georgia would complicate the project of propitiating russia nato is scheduled to review the question of georgias membership in december if georgia were in nato would nato now be at war with russia more likely russia would not be in georgia
3755998 truthfully an obama presidency should scare the pants off 70 percent of americans across the board obama is dramatically out of sync with this center right nation obamas entire campaign theme is fraudulent how can a man unite america when his views are so far out of line with average americans for whom he has revealed unbridled contempt how can he inspire america when he advertises his disdain for what he believes america has become
3755999 t he bigger government gets and the more powerful the state becomes the greater the threat to individual liberty and the greater the likelihood that evil will ensue in the 20th century the powerful state not religion was the greatest purveyor of evil in the world

3756002 from designer clothes to new cars china is getting rich democracies once bragged that theirs was the only way to economic success china is doing it the communist way
3756003 one is because of the evidence you have to have your own solid sourcing to go with this and the other is that john edwards was at no point a top contender for the presidency i mean before the campaign started this got a little bit of traction as soon as it was clear that he really wasnt going to be in the running after iowa theres no real public interest of need to know here
3756004 i was taught when i was a young reporter that its news when we say it is i think thats still news when we say it is its just who we is has changed members of the public people with modems people with cell phones are now producers editors they can push and push and push on a story until it ends up being acknowledged by everyone
3756005 the struggle to defeat the ultra right and turn our country on a positive path will not end with obamas election but that step will shift the ground for successful struggles going forward one thing is clear none of the peoples struggles from peace to universal health care to an economy that puts main street before wall street will advance if mccain wins in november lets keep our eyes on the prize

3756012 tras la experiencia adquirida de la anterior temporada en primera divisi n
3756013 en este sentido ser fundamental que seamos capaces de levantarnos antes tras una ca da
3756014 creo que uno de los problemas que tuvimos la anterior temporada es que cuando se dieron situaciones negativas reaccionamos m s tarde de lo que debimos lo que debemos intentar evitar este a o para que no tengamos que sufrir tanto aunque somos conscientes de que jugar en primera cada vez es m s complicado
3756015 ha demostrado tener muy claro a qui n traer y qu demarcaci n debe ocupar lo cual es una buena base para empezar
3756016 se han adaptado muy bien hasta el punto de que parece mentira que hayan llegado hace d as
3756017 una importante ventaja porque sabe lo que quiere y necesita el equipo
3756018 fundamentalmente ha servido para que la gente se conozca los nuevos se metan en el equipo y para continuar con la preparaci n f sica y todos estos factores han sido positivos
3756019 quiz no hemos estado tan finos de cara a la porter a como quisi ramos pero el cansancio tambi n pasa factura y es una de las cosas que m s se tarda en coger
3756020 estoy convencido de que seg n vaya pasando el tiempo mejorar todo porque contamos con mucha gente de calidad arriba
3756021 la plantilla que forma el equipo actualmente est perfectamente capacitada para afrontar la temporada
3756022 aunque tienen que mejorar ciertos detalles para hacer frente a un f tbol m s competitivo cuentan con una gran calidad que es lo que hace falta porque el resto lo da el tiempo
3756023 en las que habr que matizar cosas y coger mejor tono f sico para llegar al inicio liguero con la m xima concentraci n
3756024 la gran piedra de toque de la pretemporada por su proximidad a la primera jornada de liga
3756025 es fundamental empezar con buen pie para coger confianza aunque habr que intentar ser un poco m s ambiciosos y mantener ese nivel inicial
3756026 foi um neg cio mal feito como tantos que ocorrem entre empresas pequenas
3756027 perante o mercado de capitais com a inten o desonesta de obter algum tipo de vantagem escusa
3756028 para mim a coisa muito simples ou ele paga pelo que comprou ou me devolve a empresa
3756029 acho que a minha empresa vale muito mais sempre achei s vendi porque n o tinha mais condi es de tocar o neg cio
3756030 estoy muy contento de regresar a vitoria y adem s para jugar en el club que logr el ltimo campeonato de la liga acb por lo que este nuevo fichaje por el tau es un orgullo para m
3756031 while warner music groups organic revenues continue to decline we are quite surprised to see mr cohen selling such a large block of stock at these levels
3756032 this sale reflects nothing more than a normal need for liquid assets for personal expenses as well as my financial advisers recommendation that i diversify my portfolio for tax and estate planning
3756033 they bundled me out of the park they forced me to the floor dragged me manhandled me into a restaurant next door
3756034 only at this stage am i able to reach in my pocket and show them my olympic credential
3756035 the van door opened and i just got out and walked
3756036 the police did not understand his identity so they took him away to check his identity after that they let him go
3756037 no matter chinese citizens or foreigners in china if you want to have processions or demonstrations you should abide by chinese laws and regulations
3756038 the iocs position is clear the media must be free to report on the olympic games
3756039 we are endeavouring to discover the full facts of this incident and if necessary will raise our concerns with the appropriate authority
3756040 were hopeful that it will call upon the government province and city to help people out to do the right thing
3756041 dont worry about it rhupal my son i dont see why you have to call angela well get you married just finish school
3756042 im looking for someone thats pretty low key a non smoker no drugs not a heavy partier someone that has a life not a couch potato
3756043 you dont want to be tied to a long term lease
3756044 for example what if you did sign a six month lease and the person lost their job well youre tied to him and theres not much you can do
3756045 youve got to go to court its going to cost you money
3756046 the people are doing this to help out with the income with the way the economy is
3756047 the problem is that it the sculpture was probably borderline ok before it was vandalised
3756048 its not councils job to deliberately go out and offend people this is a public place and its open to all ages and all people
3756049 they are aware of his living arrangements which are not being paid for by the public

3756052 they just made her ms donnelly smile they were everything to her
3756053 shes trying to be strong for her little one who she has at the moment
3756054 it was like the whole square of the house was one big thick stack of smoke
3756055 i got about six foot in the front door and thats as far as i could go as there was a wall of smoke thick black smoke hitting me like a black jacket in the face
3756056 i came back and got a shirt and a torch and was right to go again but couldnt get any further
3756057 it is a bit of anti climax actually but i am happy that the courage and performance of my soldiers will be rewarded
3756058 frontal gelangt zu folgenden schlu folgerungen 1 der hauptangeklagte im gegenw rtigen proze yasser chraidi wurde von deutschen und amerikanischen geheimdiensten zum s ndenbock aufgebaut und ist vermutlich unschuldig 2 mindestens ein angeklagter musbah eter war jahrelang mitarbeiter des amerikanischen geheimdiensts cia 3 gegen einige der hauptverd chtigen ist keine anklage erhoben worden weil sie von westlichen geheimdiensten gesch tzt werden 4 mindestens einer von diesen hat f r den israelischen geheimdienst mossad gearbeitet
3756059 in unserer untersuchung gab es nur einige hinweise die mir erlaubt
3756060 wissen sie man war sehr an der auslieferung interessiert und es gab sogar viele interventionen um ihn zu bekommen
3756061 nein es waren die deutschen aber die amerikaner standen hinter dieser auslieferungsforderung es war v llig klar die amerikaner haben die deutschen angespitzt diese auslieferung zu forcieren
3756062 wir wissen zum beispiel von besuchen von herrn eter in der amerikanischen botschaft damals in ostberlin die sind belegt die sind auch durch stempel und durch beobachtung der stasi belegt die haben das ganz genau gesehen und man mu sich ja auch die situation vorstellen damals in dieser ganz hei en situation fr hjahr 1986 und danach geht ein mitarbeiter der libyer ein angestellter journalist wer er auch immer gewesen ist in die us amerikanische botschaft in ostberlin
3756063 au erdem beabsichtigte die amerikanische abwehr angeblich den agenten mahmoud ahmed ali bei der fabrikation einer sache ber die beteiligung libyscher terroristen am genannten anschlag zu nutzen
3756064 wir erhielten zus tzliche angaben dar ber da mahmoud angeblich agent des westberliner geheimdienstes ist und noch am dritten april 1986 diesen ber eine bevorstehende einfuhr von 30 000 us nach westberlin f r die bezahlung irgendeiner aktion gewarnt hat
3756065 der mossad kam also ins spiel und f r amairi nderte sich alles
3756066 der mossad war in diesem fall in norwegen seit herbst 1991 aktiv zuerst war amairi im gef ngnis dann wurde er wieder freigelassen aufgrund der hiesigen gesetze und dann nderte sich alles
3756067 without a revolutionary theory there cannot be a revolutionary movement
3756068 if i could see you stand on your feet again it would make me much more excited and happier than any praise ive received
3756069 you paid such a great price for the olympic games and for our country this made me very very heart broken we are very grateful to you and so is our country we hope you can actively cooperate with the medical treatment and recover as soon as possible
3756070 if i asked them to be more careful on details such an accident could have been avoided i felt many things are still on my mind i always felt i didnt do my job well
3756071 you guys zhang and his co directors have created a miracle for the world and i will do the same for all you three
3756072 this information was not shared with leeds city council prior to the homeless decision being reached
3756073 it is recognised that initial internal checks on his housing history and on his offending background failed to secure all the information necessary about potential risks posed
3756074 allow me to make a little history in the second congressional district tonight and introduce my partner marlon reis
3756075 growing up i always worried that that would get in the way
3756076 im proud to say that many of those barriers while some still exist have fallen tonight
3756077 its about changing the culture of washington and its about new ideas
3756078 we werent sure how voters would feel about that kind of self financing but it seems like enough of them dont mind
3756079 winnie the pooh seems to me to be a fundamental text on national security
3756080 its uncommon to see people dressed up like this so the victims were watching them
3756081 the pornography of power how defense hawks hijacked 9 11 and weakened america
3756082 let us start using this term the notion of latin america was imposed on us
3756083 let us start using this term such concept of latin america was imposed on us
3756084 we are including the black american and the white european because we do not exclude anyone for that reason everyday i speak less and less of hispanic america or latin america we are from indo america from afro america that is what we are instead of any other name
3756085 make proposals requests or petitions to the authorities of their countries that way
3756086 we will commit to the needs of our indigenous peoples
3756087 evo must be declared the president of all the indigenous peoples of this continent he must be the leader of indo america
3756088 i ride three or four a day for safety checks
3756089 you can hear things you can feel things its just not me i have six or eight men that do the same things that i do and there is a foreman on every ride that inspect the rides some rides have five or six men on them youre getting six to seven sets of eyes on every ride every day
3756090 i dont want to knock any of the parks they do a lot of maintenance i have a lot of friends we go to school with some of the biggest parks in the country and their maintenance programs are second to none but for the most part i tell everybody what would you rather ride would you rather ride a ride thats taken apart every week and set up every week so you see every internal part and everything and get inspected every single solitary day by our employees and every two weeks they get inspected by different states and jurisdictions or a park that gets inspected basically once or maybe twice a year by the governments of that state
3756091 i always say every person through that gate is my kid
3756092 i want to make sure every ride is safe enough for my kid when you come to my fair thats the way i look at it
3756093 its not the stigma ill say from 40 years ago
3756094 the dirty carnival people thats definitely not what we are
3756095 a lot of us have a church we go to some of the fairs we go to they have a church that they bring to us a lot of us go to church every sunday in the communities this is our livelihood we have our kids with us we have a hard hat protection policy a fall protection policy one of the toughest drug policies in the industry im off two months a year and i go to safety school for three weeks of that this is our business this is our lives we want people to come here and feel safe in what we do
3756096 just like i like to say its like jumping out of a plane
3756097 its one of only two traveling portable coasters that while the car is going around the track the cars spin its the best ride here you still have the old favorites the big tornado thats from germany the only one in the country like it we have the freakout which is like a hanging pendulum we also have the speed ride its basically a 120 foot propeller you sit at the very end of it and g forces on that are like no others
3756098 a year ago we were complaining about it being 2 25 a gallon now its 4 50 we play in new york where its 5 a gallon just imagine your expenses being doubled we probably run seven big generators at this spot we use some city power but mostly were an inclusive city we need diesel fuel to run the generators im glad thats not my department i dont even want to know that bill
3756099 but there is going to be a lot of smoke damage
3756100 it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
3756101 from now on its just a downward slope the end is close i love it
3756102 we are delighted with the popularity of fishtext and feedback so far indicates that users are extremely pleased with the service
3756103 fishtexts success demonstrates that traditional text messaging is an overpriced and underdeveloped service many users have expressed surprise that the fishtext mobile application delivers text messages all over the world so reliably for just a couple of pence while their own operator charges over ten times that amount with some not even providing delivery reports or charging extra for them

3756108 the increasing proportional spend on unsecured debt paints a concerning picture of consumer finances within the uk and this level of debt servicing would appear to be unsustainable with many people unable to see any light at the end of their financial tunnel there is a perception that worse is still to come our advice to any individual who is struggling with debt repayments is to speak with their lenders before things become unmanageable or contact an independent organisation such as the consumer credit counselling service to work out the best way forward
3756109 we are not being good stewards of our resources when we pursue consultation in situations where the potential effects to a species are either unlikely incapable of being meaningfully evaluated or pose only a remote risk of causing jeopardy to the species or its habitat
3756110 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3756111 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3756112 gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3756113 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3756114 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3756115 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years

3756146 i want to say with full responsibility and admit that a few hours ago i took a very difficult decision not to reply with fire

3756148 i hope that this investigation makes steady progress and leads to the quick return of the victims to japan
3756149 the agreement would fall apart in the case japan violates the agreement and does not act as demanded under the agreement
3756150 the proper venue for the complaints being raised by local 1 is through the state apprenticeship and training council as opposed to through the court
3756151 we exhausted all our efforts with the bureau of labor and industries and our objections fell on deaf ears so were pursuing legal action

3756156 its already in winkler naito developments negotiations to make the building platinum and showing they can do that may put it on the radar for new tenants
3756157 the value to all this is to have a leed document that guarantees the building will be platinum

3756171 ill never trust north korea at all i cannot be confident without seeing results
3756172 look great if they showed results in the probe into the abductions and at the same time make the right moves on the nuclear issue
3756173 i hope that the investigation will be carried out thoroughly and lead to the swift return of the victims

3756188 we were applying the statutes as effectively as we could
3756189 the bottom line is we have to protect our citizens
3756190 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3756191 we however note apple products typically carry low margins and strong initial sales could negatively impact best buys gross margin
3756192 it has been a rare bright spot for both of them
3756193 multifamily started off as a bit player with us but in recent years it has taken on more importance
3756194 one reason that multifamily stocks have done better than other sectors is that they have a capital raising advantage
3756195 in 06 and 07 they were marginalized by the investment banks
3756196 we figured if thats what it took to compete we were going to let them go
3756197 we have a different business model in our multifamily business than we do on single family homes
3756198 its a lucrative business for them and they are doing a lot of it for that reason
3756199 it is not an indictment of your educational quality because it is such a different sample of students from what weve seen before
3756200 instead of testing just the college bound you are testing a lot of students who didnt plan to attend college
3756201 a lot of variation in high school in terms of how well kids are being prepared for college
3756202 as we expand the pool for more students we are bringing in more students for whom high school is not preparing them as well for post secondary education
3756203 im going to tell them i think they are the heartland of america that the values they hold dear are the strength and character of america
3756204 theyre the reason why the people in georgia today are looking to america a beacon of hope and liberty

3756206 democrats ready to unload on mccain reed over atlanta fund raiser
3756207 calling yourself a maverick and claiming credit for fighting corruption while raising money with one of the central figures in the jack abramoff corruption scandal is not what most voters have in mind when they think of straight talk
3756208 it is however one more example of why john mccain is offering more of the same failed republican leadership
3756209 despite his shady ties to abramoff mccain never called reed to testify before his committee in fact despite acknowledging wrongdoing among his colleagues mccain refused to investigate fellow republicans in congress
3756210 john mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption shows how far he is is willing to go to win despite all of his rhetoric about reform mccains willingness to accept tainted money raised by tainted abramoff cronies like ralph reed shows that mccain simply cannot be trusted to bring change to washington politics a maverick no more the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
3756211 im strongly supporting senator mccain because hes advocating conservative positions on taxes judges energy strengthening the family and common sense values i have great respect for his service to the country
3756212 i sent that e mail out in my capacity as a private citizen i dont hold any position or title with the mccain campaign havent sought one dont want one
3756213 we are going to investigate mccain for being connected to lobbyists
3756214 ive got friends here who have just been lifelong friends people who have seen me through thick and thin in tough times and in good times
3756215 there are a lot of people who have done everything right and yet are still coming up short
3756216 and over time their faith in the american dream starts slipping away
3756217 although the impact on their web sites is clear i believe this may end up being just some kids who got overexcited with georgia being ill prepared to say the least
3756218 while georgia is obviously under a ddos attacks and it is political in nature it doesnt so far seem different than any other online aftermath by fans political tensions are always followed by online attacks by sympathizers
3756219 the new latitude laptops and dell precision mobile workstations represent the largest client product development effort in the history of dell
3756220 weve invested more than one million engineering hours and the result is a family of head turning products that are as solid on the inside as on the outside with features that enable better security manageability and productivity

3756223 what has voters in addition to most of the states business education and political organizations and lobbies so concerned is that proponents havent offered any definitive plan for fulfilling the amendments requirement that the legislature replace the lost property tax money with other public funding
3756224 as floridas coffers shrink in the face of a dour economy confusion over a tax statute threatens to choke the flow of home sales at a time when the state is struggling under the burden of millions of unsold properties
3756225 orlandos home resale market recorded its second best sales month of the year in july and local realtors said a marked improvement in the number of pending contracts bodes well for the rest of 2008
3756226 skeptical state regulators grilled representatives of floridas largest private property insurer on tuesday as state farm officials tried to make a case for their 47 1 percent rate increase for their 950 000 residential customers

3756234 when i see buildings like this i feel like ive got to paint it before its gone
3756235 i love the colors and the light as well as the forms and the architecture
3756236 i think there should be a balance somehow keeping whats here and preserving it
3756237 of course i like to paint the older stuff better but its cool against all these subdued and muted earth colors and rusted out things to suddenly see bright blues and yellows popping out
3756238 children of this age are basically curious and thats why cyber safety is failing
3756239 we talk about educating children about the internet but i think the department needs to educate their teachers on cyber safety and whats appropriate for a teacher to share online
3756240 if adults or siblings are giving our children access to facebook then it is a concern more widely
3756241 the school has taken appropriate action to ensure its teachers exercise discretion when posting material on sites such as facebook
3756242 the tragic effect of these events upon your son who i have no doubt you love sincerely is one of the most disturbing features of this crime

3756245 corrections victoria made this decision after careful consideration and a thorough assessment of security risks
3756246 looking over the last two or three weeks the 90 day bill rates down around half a per cent so thats significantly reduced the banks marginal cost of short term funding
3756247 i think that means that theres no obvious reason that the banks could not pass through any change in the cash rate
3756248 if youre registering in these economic circumstances a 7 per cent increase in profit i would say that those banks owe it to working families
3756249 when official interest rates move those moves should be passed on to consumers
3756250 the reserve bank does not see a case for permanent government intervention in the mortgage market
3756251 by and large the australian public were willing to accept interest rate rises out of official movements to secure the future of our banks
3756252 i think anyone who has had telstra shares in their portfolio should be pretty pleased because those shares have not gone down like a lot of others have
3756253 this year we would have had an exciting presence with apb at e3 if we had continued with webzen as our publisher but given that we re acquired the rights to apb just this spring and closed a very large fundraising round 50 000 000 to secure apbs future the timing just wasnt right to attend e3 rtw is very excited with apbs progress and we have used our fundraising as a means to invest even more heavily in the apb development team rtw hopes to release more information later this year with regards to game play details and beta plans

3756311 ja god ik houd van u omdat u de enige echte god bent
3756312 dat doe ik omdat ik ook maar mens ben ik ben niet perfect
3756313 waarom dwaal je dan ver af als het goed met je gaat waarom bid je alleen of je leven er vanaf hangt als het slecht met je gaat
3756314 waarom zing je alleen maar op bijeenkomsten van de gemeente en andere evenementen waarom zoek je me alleen maar in de eredienst waarom vraag je alleen maar dingen voor jezelf waarom vraag je de dingen zo trouweloos
3756315 waarom schaam je je voor mij waarom vertel je de mensen niet over het goede nieuws waarom huil je bij anderen uit als het tegenzit terwijl ik mezelf aanbied om alles bij mij te brengen waarom verzin je allemaal uitwegen als ik je de mogelijkheden bied om in mijn koninkrijk te dienen
3756316 jij bent gezegend met leven ik heb je niet gemaakt om dit geschenk zomaar weg te gooien ik heb je gezegend met talenten om mij te dienen maar je blijft je maar van me afkeren ik heb mijn woord aan jou gegeven maar je doet niets met die kennis ik heb tot jou gesproken maar je oren zaten dicht ik heb mijn zegeningen aan je laten zien maar je ogen waren er niet op gericht ik heb jou dienaars gezonden maar je zat werkeloos toe te kijken toen zij werden weggestuurd ik heb je gebeden gehoord en ik heb ze ook allemaal verhoord

3756330 there is no easy explanation on these things and how we got to this point
3756331 clients perceptions of how reorientation therapy and self help can promote changes in sexual orientation
3756332 the story is totally plausible it began as a faux documentary initially but we realised it had so much relevance and was maybe too realistic so we turned it into a drama
3756333 whats exciting from our viewpoint as storytellers is so often we had put a huge amount of effort into a blue chip documentary that would screen one night and disappear and wed be left with all this valuable research material that couldnt be used again
3756334 its almost not worth putting standard definition televisions on the floor even at 89 people are just not interested
3756335 in all of our stores hdtv sales are up between 10 and 40 per cent and probably by at least 40 per cent in the last few weeks
3756336 it is the only product i can think of at the moment that is selling like hotcakes
3756337 we have sold more than three times what i would have expected and again i think the olympics have been a factor
3756338 i didnt think tivo would be a big seller sometimes you just never know
3756339 we note that subscription related revenues pay television professional publishing and filmed entertainment are exhibiting a high level of resilience in almost all regions by contrast advertising revenues are almost universally challenged
3756340 we are not going to do stupid things just because we want to get something on a certain date
3756341 to say that our planning is well advanced is an understatement
3756342 our coverage wont be this kind of fairly limited offering which understandably is limited because of a very different kind of commercial modality
3756343 theres a lot of enthusiasm in the current coverage and we all enjoy celebrating australian victories but i have been surprised other australians in the same contest that might have been unplaced suddenly dont get mentioned
3756344 our churn has continued to trend downwards since june 30 and i am pretty confident we will have churn below 13 per cent in the medium term
3756345 we need to bunker down remembering we have a product that represents good value and the best available in home entertainment solution in a difficult time
3756346 the taxpayer funded abc is helping prop up a cut price commercial tv station allowing adelaides nine news to cadge off public servants to do their work while allowing their billionaire owner bruce gordon who lives in the bahamas to keep his money in his pocket

3756365 people come in the mornings to get a medal update and a schedule of whats on in the afternoon we see a lot more people watching videos
3756366 i think were going to smash any streaming targets we might have set
3756367 when seven throws to the website we see an immediate spike in traffic
3756368 thirty per cent of tv viewers are online at the same time
3756369 its certainly being demonstrated that that audience is using the web to give them extra information
3756370 put nsw out of step with the rest of the common law world
3756371 it was only with the help of media reports that the suspect was identified by a member of the public and then captured
3756372 under the new law the media couldnt have identified him and he might still be at large
3756373 in cowra the media was initially able to identify the alleged killer and the children on the day the crime was committed but was not able to identify them once charges had been laid even though their identities were already public
3756374 later the media were able to identify them again when the father of the children gave permission were not able to identify them when the father changed his mind and finally the media were able to identify them again when the mother gave permission
3756375 its ludicrous censorship it doesnt serve justice and it doesnt protect the rights of child victims
3756376 but when a child has died how can there be justice if no one knows who they are or who killed them
3756377 suspected killers will fall below the radar of public and media attention if they and their child victims cant be named the new law would effectively protect the perpetrators of many serious crimes against children
3756378 london want to know exactly what will be the situation for the media in 2012
3756379 there isnt a single person in the world who can actually tell you but we work with a lot of experienced people who can give their opinions
3756380 the way the media is changing is very very interesting
3756381 there are things that we are having to deal with now in these games that didnt even exist in the winter games in turin and that was only 18 months ago
3756382 nbc the official us broadcaster are streaming 70 per cent of the events of these games live but with the winter games in turin they did next to nothing live on the internet
3756383 i knew more about many olympic sports than many other australian journalists
3756384 it was obvious to anyone in the media that it would be a very interesting assignment if you were working in the media
3756385 they actually had to change their laws to allow foreign journalists to be able to operate freely
3756386 if you were to go back to 1996 or even 2000 in australia and you wanted to watch the olympics the only thing you can see is what one single station seven would show in a 24 hour period
3756387 in future you will be able to pick and choose whatever sport you want to watch and watch it whenever you want
3756388 a strong part of what i do is pushing for freedom of the media we at the ioc are very strong on that
3756389 we dont give out numbers but were 50 per cent over the targets that we set for ourselves
3756390 it has the potential to be a bit of a watershed because the olympics is so mainstream
3756391 we expect that more and more people having used the olympics will sign up to other packages
3756392 the percentage of bigponds revenue that is content compared with access services is still relatively small it will be in the 15 per cent range
3756393 as devices become more sophisticated with the launch of the iphone and similar devices and bandwidth grows people are going online on their phone a lot more often
3756394 the two major trends driving growth have been in social networking and in mobile search
3756395 social networking is driving the bulk of our mobile traffic at the moment and its up 50pc over the quarter
3756396 youtube is now making up the bulk of our video streams
3756397 i dont think there is a lot of content that people want to pay for
3756398 weve had tremendous subscriber growth this year for all of our sports packs
3756399 theres other content thats nice to have but its not essential so people wont pay for it
3756400 people will pay for it we have a whole bunch of seinfeld episodes for sale interestingly drama doesnt seem to have worked quite so well weve tried a variety of things including nine network drama damages its hard to get deeply deeply involved for a long time with a mobile phone screen

3756451 in my version there was actually a new villain it wasnt one of the classics which is probably why they didnt use it it was more of a hannibal lecter type he was somebody already in arkham asylum that bruce went and sort of studied with

3756480 promotion was the climax of 2 years hard work and got the club back towards where it deserves to be to see so many hooped shirts inside hillsborough was an amazing sight and to celebrate in the crowd after with my wife and so many friends was a great feeling also we had a hell of a party all the way home on the coach and it was carried on back with the coach load of fans and friends that had travelled from stevenage long into the night you know who you all are what was it like working for the charismatic ian holloway working with ollie was a fantastic experience not at least for the fact we got all the one liners before you did on a serious note i felt he put a lot of pride and passion back into the club and was the sort of gaffer that you could talk to about anything whether it be football or personal you only have to read his book to be inspired and get an insight to everything that went on is there anyone you keep in touch with at qpr past or present i don t keep in touch with any of the lads in particular but my wife and i get over to at least 3 or 4 games a season to catch up and enjoy the atmosphere before and after we both made a lot of friends who supported the club during our time at qpr and still see most of them a lot now

3756490 and accounted for 52 of the photo merchandise market value last year by the end of 2008 were going to see this figure reach 57 looking further ahead nearly 30m photobooks will be sold in western europe in 2012
3756491 online is still the channel of choice for most consumers in this market
3756492 accounting for nearly 90 of orders across western europe it makes sense that people are more inclined to create and order photobooks in the comfort of their homes due to the amount of time involved in the creation process and from a retailers perspective theres little appeal in consumers tying up in store kiosks for relatively long periods of time though there are a number of time efficient solutions coming to market calendars and single image gifts require far less creation time and are therefore better suited to the retail environment
3756493 overall the photo merchandise market will be fuelled by falling prices and a growing availability of services at retail which will also drive cannibalisation of the 6x4
3756494 nenhum soldado das tropas russas de paz foram mandados a gori
3756495 non asolutamente preoccupante per me sono convinto che arriveranno dei giocatori forti che ci faranno grande comodo ricordiamoci per che noi abbiamo a che fare con gli stessi calciatori che ci hanno portato a questi livelli dei quali mi fido e anche questanno faranno vedere di che pasta sono fatti
3756496 si vero ma abbiamo vinto delle partite come la finale di coppa italia in cui mancini non giocava anche giuly partito e poteva tornarci utile la societ deve lavorare con tranquillit secondo delle regole e delle possibilit interne e di conseguenza cercare di fare il loro meglio
3756497 no abbiamo sorriso oggi ieri e continueremo a sorridere al di l dei risultati lo sport ha questi principi per ci fa piacere che totti torni in campo per darci una mano le intenzioni sono quelle poi domani valuteremo meglio la situazione
3756498 suazo lo abbiamo gi seguito lanno scorso che conosciamo noi abbiamo sottotiro una serie di nomi e valuteremo poi strada facendo quello che si incastrer meglio con le nostre esigenze
3756499 quando ai calciatori vengono offerte elevate possibilit economiche e tecniche sono situazioni che bisogna accettare senza creare dei presupposti di invidia nessun problema con suazo
3756500 non lo so sono cose che riguardano la societ il giocatore a noi piace ma chiaro che deve rientrare in una serie di parametri io non posso andare dalla societ a chiedere questo o quellaltro secondo me non corretto rispetto allimpegno che ha messo la famiglia sensi in questo club
3756501 sono stato tranquilizzato dal medico dovrebbe stare bene ed in forma per la supercoppa artur per ora non lo conosciamo bene stiamo analizzando altre situazioni di mercato ma con calma vedremo cosa dir il mercato giocare in porta un ruolo strano un ruolo difficile e specifico
3756502 non lo so se c qualcuno che ti crea difficolt ovviamente bene fare attenzione come con nen o ciss sono loro che sfruttano la roma noi non abbiamo mai richiesto nessuno di questi
3756503 stanno bene hanno fatto una buona partita al di l del potenziale dellavversario sono continui e forti possono entrare nelle prima quattro posizioni
3756504 non si vedono da queste partite i valori delle squadre non fanno testo noi sappiamo dare considerazione agli organici importanti tutte possono competere lippi ci ha fatto dei piacevoli complimenti comunque lui conosce alcuni nostri giocatori sa che siamo forti per essere al pari dellinter forse ci vorrebbe lui come allenatore
3756505 giocatori di questo livello internazionale ci mettono poco non cadiamo per nellerrore di credere che il nuovo sia sempre meglio del vecchio
3756506 penso che i miei colleghi per arrivare dove sono hanno qualit e spesso imparo da loro sono convinto sar cos anche da lui non voglio entrare nel merito
3756507 si allena bene con intensit sa sacrificarsi ha ottime intenzioni lo vedremo lui forte io lo conosco bene
3756508 noi abbiamo gi vinto una coppa con questo modulo abbiamo fatto importanti risultati non stravolge le nostre caratteristiche cerchiamo di creare traffico a centrocampo da l partono le azioni importanti la cosa difficile coprire dentro se giochi largo ho giocatori duttili che sanno inserirsi i nostri centrocampisti sanno interpretare bene questo tipo di gioco
3756509 quello che gli successo un po di tempo fa ti lascia il segno lui vuole sempre dare il massimo quel suo essere aggressivo positivamente agonistico il limite molto labile io gli richiedo di ringhiare di essere cattivo con rispetto ovviamente delle regole e degli avversari qualche volta lui sconfina se ne parla come abbiamo fatto e loro sono in grado da soli di capire quando sbagliano
3756510 le convocazioni creano disturbi perch non ci lavori insieme ma di contro sono utili perch danno carica e lustro certo un segnale importante dopo essere stato lasciato fuori alleuropeo
3756511 alla lunga sarebbe una cosa che pagheremmo pu capitarti un infortunio o qualcosa che magari ti disturba
3756512 it was just an ordinary briefing and we still have to consult the side of the moro islamic liberation front we are hoping for more discussions
3756513 they explained it moa but it was very short from 9 am to 12 noon only even the questions from the bishops and other sectors were also limited to two
3756514 personally in general i would assess the briefing as insufficient without any clear conclusion
3756515 i dont think so the way grp they answered it the questions there is this general feeling that there are still a lot of questions with regard to the inclusion of some territories in the bangsamoro juridical entity
3756516 secondly a lot also needs to be clarified about the contents and implications of this moa
3756517 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3756518 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3756519 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share

3756521 i am flattered by celtics interest they are one of the biggest teams in the world and their fans are the best in the world
3756522 but newcastle have very good fans and i am flattered by their interest also but we have to wait it does not depend on me
3756523 there is so much that needs to be done for a transfer but a move to the united kingdom is the one i want to move my career forward
3756524 the premier league is appealing but celtic are the biggest team in scotland and are known everywhere so i dont know i love the united kingdom and that is all i can say
3756525 i love the united kingdom and that is all i can say

3756548 it seems unlikely that wild birds have carried the strain to africa since the last migration of wild birds from europe and central asia to africa occurred in september 2007

3756550 this increases the risk of avian influenza spread to other countries in western africa
3756551 many countries have succeeded in getting the virus under control but as long as avian influenza remains endemic in some countries the international community needs to be on the alert

3756553 last week the house energy and commerce committee sent letters to 33 companies asking detailed questions about how they serve up web ads to customers and whether they collect or store data on peoples internet searches
3756554 however we understand that there are some users who prefer not to receive customized advertising and this opt out will offer them even greater choice
3756555 in the last few years and due to the advent of the google adsense web advertising program scraper sites have proliferated at an amazing rate for spamming search engines open content sites such as wikipedia are a common source of material for scraper sites

3756566 the mortgage finance system in the united states has been badly damaged

3756575 about 11am one of the aircraft pilots declared an aircraft emergency and diverted to coffs harbour airport to land
3756576 the damaged hawk circled over the ocean to reduce its fuel load and the pilot of the second aircraft conducted a visual check for damage the damaged aircraft landed safely at coffs harbour airport while the second returned to raaf base williamtown near newcastle
3756577 the probability the aircraft clipped a power line approximately 25 nautical miles east of armidale
3756578 the hawk has sustained some damage to its left wing
3756579 it is uncertain at this stage what it will cost to repair the aircraft
3756580 they distinctly said over the radio that it had clipped powerlines

3756583 we feel fairly comfortable with the acreage report the usda came out with folks on the ground farmers seed dealers and different parts of the industry say that acreage number was acceptable
3756584 what really is a concern though is the usda numbers that say theres a lot more rice in the pipeline
3756585 beginning stocks are like an accounting balance sheet the same as ending stocks from the previous year the usda saw fit to increase the rice beginning carry in by several million hundredweights
3756586 but we were out of rice at the end of last year the rice trade ground to a halt in february and march there hasnt been any rice to be traded so we find it difficult to understand where these additional hundredweights came from on the carry in side
3756587 the nass national agricultural statistics service of the usda is the agency that does all the statistical work in estimates for corn production soybean production rice production and so on
3756588 their first objective yield survey of the season comes out aug 12
3756589 let me read you the footnote on page 14 in the wasde for june and july the projected yield is derived from the trend yields by rice for the period of 1990 to 2007
3756590 so the yield we showed was based on trend not a survey or us taking a yield number and adjusting for weather or insect damage its based only on statistical trends and thats clearly footnoted in the table
3756591 not allowed to be out in front of nass the agency responsible for basing yield estimates on a survey and the first nass survey isnt until august when we first came out with the 2008 09 estimates in may june and july they were all based on trends
3756592 would expect to see a fairly significant reduction in yield estimates come august thats because so much of the u s rice crop is late this year in arkansas there was severe flooding early that kept farmers out of fields i spoke with a louisiana producer a couple of weeks ago that was just planting his rice
3756593 you cant expect anything close to a bumper crop and thats what usda is predicting so far their numbers show us having about 100 pounds less than last years excellent crop
3756594 weve seen a lot of market reaction out of these numbers the stocks report usda came out with on june 30 was very illustrative of our points pull and scan it and youll see rice in all positions drastically decreased from march 1 it demonstrates the rice wasnt there
3756595 major traders guys at elevators exporters everyone is confused as to what is going on with the market everyone agrees the rice isnt out there if it were wed have been selling it for 1 000 per ton earlier this year the market has gone down significantly it was at 25 per hundredweight in april and now its around 17 20
3756596 somewhere around 17 65 our concern is more long term if our farmers dont see the price response to the market they need they wont plant rice next year
3756597 was very revealing and positive for the market we had a limit up day as the positions became clear
3756598 weve also been pushing for a sept 1 stock reporting date in addition to the normal aug 1 report
3756599 as the critical mass of rice acreage moves into north arkansas and missouri the harvest time is postponed a bit more every year so the dates that were set forth in statute 15 or 20 years ago no longer reflect the positions in the market at the time of harvest and thats what they were designed to do a sept 1 report would provide a sort of baseline to figure out what kind of rice we have in all positions at the end of harvest
3756600 to provide market transparency with the current market volatility the more transparency the better for everyone

3756621 we should have pounced on her early when she was unsettled and not throwing as well we let her settle into the game and then she really dominated
3756622 what is happening in tripoli now is the confrontation line between two views on one hand those who are trying to find a solution to get out of the crisis and on the other hand those who are trying to maintain tripoli in chaos

3756682 pauline was getting over the election loss and deciding whether to stay in politics
3756683 i am open to offers and i think that a farmer wants a wife is interesting and some of those people have met their ideal matches and i think thats wonderful i would dearly love to meet someone who i can spend the rest of my life with and have that companionship with
3756684 i think she would be brilliant in the media as a political commentator but not on reality tv that would be a mistake
3756685 or she would be brilliant at hosting maybe something like oprah
3756686 i dont think she would have a problem finding mr right thats why i think it is so bizarre
3756687 far from protecting the rights of dead children this law will protect their killers
3756688 but when a child has died how can there be justice if no one knows who they are or who killed them
3756689 the reality is that suspected killers will fall below the radar of public and media attention if their child victims cant be named
3756690 theres two main things that will assist in saving peoples lives the first is having an adequate amount of fire alarms and the other is that everyone knows the way out in darkness and confusion
3756691 the legislation is that you only need one working smoke alarm per level in every home but we say you should have a working smoke alarm in every bedroom and in the hallway
3756692 we also recommend that they be wired into the main electrical system and all are inter connected so alarms go off at the same time so you know there is a problem in the home
3756693 dad was an immigrant a self made man he had no education but he was energetic driven and humorous
3756694 this house was their dream its a beautiful block and they had put an extraordinary amount of time and effort into the place
3756695 i asked him not long ago why he had spent so long on the garden but only just started the house he said son you can build a house in a year but it takes 10 to grow a garden
3756696 all i have to say to other owner builders is that i would never wish anything like this horrible tragedy to happen to anyone else
3756697 this is a situation where poor practices have culminated in one fatality and two hospitalisations
3756698 the association is aware of the amount of hours ministerial drivers do
3756699 it must be risk assessed and we are in continuing discussions with the premiers office over ways to deal with these issues
3756700 our organization rose to the challenge and delivered strong second quarter earnings and cash flow despite the poor economic environment
3756701 while we are never fully satisfied when sales are down we continued to outperform most of our major competitors in same store sales and to gain market share with a combination of differentiated merchandise current fashions and great value
3756702 the data is starting to paint a picture of a much weaker global economy with some countries on the cusp of recession
3756703 with the software youre able to calculate what the expected wind would be at that time and to tell you how much power you should be generating
3756704 in this case i would say it was a million dollars well spent
3756705 our mines are operating as planned our expansion projects are progressing well and we continued to realize on excellent silver prices
3756706 there is no question that of late silver prices have been extremely volatile however the fundamentals remain positive and i am optimistic that silver will trend higher over the balance of the year leading to continuing strong financial results for pan american
3756707 pan american now expects to produce 18 8 million ounces of silver in 2008 and 25 million ounces of silver in 2009
3756708 the challenge of the 21st century is to meet the growing need for energy in ways that are not only profitable but sustainable
3756709 it was never our intention to be misleading in our advertisement
3756710 the asas decision to uphold wwfs complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable
3756711 we continue to see strong opportunities in the global military market for our portfolio of products and services as evidenced by these contracts
3756712 it is encouraging to see defence forces looking more and more to modelling simulation and support services to address challenges such as maintaining readiness high operational demand on aircraft and increasing fuel costs
3756713 i think a drop of 20 per cent is a bit over done
3756714 weve fallen too far too fast i expect the market to sit between 110 and 120 in the short term
3756715 have taken profits as theyve seen demand destruction in the u s and theyre seeing it spread a little into europe
3756716 u s gasoline demand last week was almost four per cent lower compared to the same week in 2007 despite a considerable decline in retail prices
3756717 the question is where will the number level off at for china in the next few months
3756718 china is an enormous driver for the price of oil along with india brazil and the middle east
3756719 our focus in fiscal 2009 is to stabilize the company and improve operating performance
3756720 we have made good progress but much work remains to be done
3756721 we are delighted to have secured an entry into the highly attractive u s pipe and tube market
3756722 remediation and dewatering of the no 1 shaft had been progressing smoothly up to this point
3756723 an inflow at this rate is disappointing but our remediation plan as approved by our joint venture partners recognized the risk and included specific actions to be taken at various levels of inflow
3756724 we believe that bringing pingtels critical research and development capabilities in house will enable us to further develop software based solutions
3756725 we expect that this will enable nortel to accelerate the development of new it centric channels to market

3756731 theyre deciding on paternity leave but nobody in australia really knows what effect it may have if dads stay home with their children
3756732 we need to bring fathers into the discussion but the research isnt there
3756733 the chances are that we are using a lot of energy and taxpayers money throwing money at problems without being able to address them effectively
3756734 we know that fathers have an effect on literacy and breastfeeding rates but usually the lactation consultants only talk to the mums
3756735 we need to define clearly the notion of fatherhood and understand its relationship to motherhood
3756736 the debate has been largely framed from the mothers perspective either from a traditional standpoint that its womens work or from a feminist standpoint that its definitely womens work
3756737 the whole area of male role models fatherhood male involvement in childrearing has never been sufficiently investigated and needs attention
3756738 gender roles are changing and couples with children are having to navigate and negotiate that
3756739 that is why the people are happy that u s forces are doing this
3756740 they have asked for our assistance and we have been able to provide it
3756741 and the reason we are able to provide it is because we have this great cooperation with the afghan army the police our british allies and of course our troops are out here doing a fantastic job as well
3756742 im sure a lot of belgians feel it is unfair that the champions of a country have to play a qualifying round to get into the champions league
3756743 brindavans mother durga khote tells him that kunj asrani brother of kusum with whom his marriage was happened in childhood but gauna was done and later marriage was broken by his father om shiv puri has given him the toy as he sells the things in this village also and often gives toys to charan freely brindavan becomes curious about kusum and asks more about kusum he says that today he had met a girl in other village and whose name was kusum on other side kusum tells her friend manno farida jalal about brindaban that today she had met him manno asks her if brindaban had recognised her and if he comes to take her home then will she go with him kusum says
3756744 next morning kusum does not find kunj at home and he has left home without taking breakfast and he has left his lunch box also manno tells kusum that she has seen kunj going on work after work kusum is resting when she hears the knocking on the door she finds charan standing there with durga khote she does not understand what to do and say but after some moments she welcomes durga khote and touches her feet she is relaxed because of charans presence and starts talking with him she offers to bring something to drink and durga khote lies on the bed and says that she will eat at lunch time as she has come to spend whole day here kusum is in trouble now as she does not have anything to cook she goes out of the room and finds brindavan standing at the door she gets to know that kunj had invited the family for lunch she sends him inside the room and after some time calls charan and asks him to send brindavan to her he goes and says
3756745 hearing this brindavan and his mother smile and brindavan goes to kusum kusum explains to him that because kunj is not at home and she can not go to market brindavan asks her to tell what is to be brought from the market she is not ready to say things directly she says that kunj had left early and money was in his pocket brindavan
3756746 are chhodi huyee stri ko uska pati phir se apna le isse badee baat kya hogee mein jo use phir se use apnee bahu bana rahee hun ye kya kam badee baat hai brindavan knows inside that kusum will not be agree on this condition but he is helpless before his mother and maintains silence in the evening kunj comes fearing that kusum will scold him he pretends as if he does not know anything kusum also pretends that nothing happened in the day time he asks while eating
3756747 next day an ignorant kunj carries the gold bangles and gives them to durga khote who understands the indirect refusal of kusum she is angry brindavan is also disturbed his mother says that now she will look for another girl brindaban and charan reach at kusums village and charan goes to kusum who is standing at the bank of river with manno charan
3756748 brindaban laughs heavily and says that kali is the daughter of their cook and she is friend of charan kusum
3756749 brindavan tells her the story lakhi sharmila tagore and in which situations he had to marry her kusum is convinced kusum says
3756750 brindavan says to her that she did not do good thing by returning gold bangles and she insulted his mother kusum
3756751 brindavan says that he will convince his mother and leaves with a smile kusum is happy and dreams have come in her eyes and hope is spread in her heart ghar jaayegee tar jaayegee doliyaan chadh jaayegee mehandee lagaayegee re kaajal sajaayegee re dulhaniyaa mar jaayegee dheere dheere leke chalanaa aangan se nikalanaa koee dekhe naa dulhan ko galee me aakhiyaan zukaye huye ghugantaa giraye huye mukhadaa chhupaaye huye chalee mai jaayegee ghar jaayegee mehandee mehandee khelee thee mai teree hee sahelee thee mai too ne jab kusum ko chunaa thaa too ne meraa naam kabhee aakhon se pukaaraa nahee maine jaane kaise sunaa thaa jaayegee ghar jaayegee in the morning she is waiting and charan picks up a toy and asks her first time she addresses charan as beta and she blushes after realising it charan sees vermillion and asks what is that thing kusum
3756752 destiny has different notions and brindabans servant comes alone to take charan kusum heart is broken her hopes are destroyed charan unaware to her devastated state goes back kunj comes back and asks kusum
3756753 but she realises what she has said and prays for the long age of brindavan brindavan is given a nice song to sing after this occasion apanaa kinaaraa nadiyaan kee dhaaraa hai saahilon pe bahanewaale kabhee sunaa to hogaa kahee kaagajon kee kashteeyon kaa kahee kinaaraa hotaa nahee o maazee re maazee re koee kinaaraa jo kinaare se mile wo apanaa kinaaraa hai paaneeyon mein bah rahe hai kaee kinaare toote huye raasaton mein mil gaye hain sabhee sahaaree chhoote huye koee sahaaraa mazadhaare mein mile jo apanaa sahaaraa hai has incorporated in this song many people see the clusters of soil falling in to the river but to use this simile in to a song is an amazing work brindavans mother wants to take charan with her to the city but he does not live away from brindavan so he stays back with him only kusums friend manno has been married to the compounder of brindavan but her husband dies in the epidemic plague brindavans village is suffering badly from plague and his manager tries to convince him to leave charan at kusums home as that village is untouched from the disease brindavan does not agree to this plan but manager takes charan with him and drops him at kusums home and leaves for city in the evening brindavan does not find charan at home and goes to kusums village and finds him there he informs kusum that mannos husband has been died kusum forces him to leave charan there as she does not want to send charan in plague affected village and she even forces brindavan to come back to her home in every evening to stay there brindavan tells him why he could not come that day she says that she knows it now he asks her why she did not contact him after that episode she says that she got to know about his mothers visit to city and her plans and in his home its his mothers wish that rules sick kunj is also cured by brindavan and charan has become too close to kusum rich old lady asks kusum that when she knows that brindavans mother has gone to fix his marriage in city then why she is allowing brindavan and his son to stay at her home kusum says that this is her last chance to get some happiness in life and perhaps after this she will never get any chance and all hopes will be lost so why she should not avail this opportunity one evening brindavan declares that in the morning he would go back to his village as his mother is coming back kusum comes back on earth and she asks if charan would also go with him brindavan says
3756754 kusum lifts her face and her eyes are filled with tears he takes a pause and says
3756755 brindavan decorates kusum heads with vermillion and kunj comes out and says
3756756 our summer learning programme has been a fantastic opportunity for young people in the area giving them experience and allowing them to see what the college has to offer
3756757 one in five calls we get relate to people doing the three peaks challenge
3756758 its a real problem it would be fair to say that the ones we meet underestimate whats involved in doing the mountain particularly at night
3756759 they often dont have warm clothing no map or compass no torch we dont go out to provide a free guide service but we have to assess whether they are at risk of coming to harm
3756760 the authority has the ability to publicise the fact that people doing the challenge on this scale are not welcome
3756761 we need to tell people to find three other mountains and spread the load a bit at the moment its all concentrated on here
3756762 they get themselves some cheap gear and a large proportion of them have no mountain walking experience
3756763 they decide to raise some money for charity and come here
3756764 so after ced asked that question i was talking to jonny at home and jonny would you like to say what you told me
3756765 figuring out how to protect senior citizens from victimization even when its caused by their own mistakes is one of the biggest issues facing us right now but we also have to figure out how to balance our desire to protect vulnerable seniors with their rights to autonomy

3756771 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax

3756878 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

3756925 a radical change from the current trajectory is required a complete reordering of global society
3756926 humans only truly unite when faced with a powerful external enemy

3756936 in forresters 110 criteria evaluation of contract life cycle management clm vendors we found that certain contract management software providers led the pack because of their advanced functions for contract creation contract repositories analysis and reporting of contractual exposures and benefits and contract compliance
3756937 forrester evaluated how well the product supports the creation of contracts the importing of legacy contracts and contracts from third parties reporting and analysis of existing contracts the management of contract compliance and the optimization of their contracts value
3756938 forrester used vendor surveys and interviews to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each solution for each vendor we interviewed two to three reference clients to get their perspectives on the products strengths and weaknesses and the vendors support and responsiveness
3756939 independent research such as that provided in this forrester research report is an essential tool to companies evaluating contract management solutions these reports provide an in depth evaluation and analysis of all the competitive solutions on the market and rely on multiple interviews with actual users of the software to come to their conclusions it would be difficult for a company to replicate this type of effort in their own internal review process in evaluating technology i highly recommend the use of independent research

3756946 the echosystem provides unmatched functionality to our project management program with its automated lecture capture system podcasting capabilities and virtual lectures all while keeping it effortless for our faculty
3756947 using the echosystem our online and remote students have an educational experience equivalent to their on campus counterparts
3756948 lecture capture simply cant be contained to a single department or program once students experience the academic and lifestyle benefits created with 24 7 lecture replay they ask for more
3756949 the growth pattern were seeing at gw is mirrored at institutions around the world we designed the echosystem platform to scale making it the preferred technology for institutions deciding to expand lecture capture to meet skyrocketing student requests
3756950 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3756951 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3756952 were pulling for him i never said i was disappointed all i said basically was wed like to see him start hitting and it created a stir i mean ive said that about other players
3756953 and to his credit he has continued to hustle and he has played really well in right field
3756954 i really respect him and i really like him as a player but i get asked every day and i said look if a guy is struggling whether its fukudome or anybody else if he continues to struggle you try to find somebody else whos swinging the bat thats all i said and if it created a stir im sorry
3756955 to me were a pitching defense oriented team that relies on just enough hitting
3756956 thats the way i view my team so its important for us to play good defense and you can see that cardinals series we pitched well and we played very well defensively and we won two out of three games i think thats a little microcosm of our season
3756957 you look at our team and you look at where weve scored the most runs in the national league
3756958 but consistently theres a gap between a lot of scoring and too little scoring so we need to play good defense and we need to get good pitching and thats our formula
3756959 but i do know that for us the right formula is good solid pitching good solid defense and timely hitting
3756960 we get into these swings where we swing the bats really really well and put some runs on the board and make it look relatively comfortable and then we get into these other streaks where everythings a struggle because we dont score enough runs but one thing is for sure your defense should be constant and one of the things that i really like about this team is we started off rather slowly and were picking up steam as far as plays are concerned
3756961 he didnt throw too many breaking balls sunday kerry basically feels hes ready and you know what he probably is but i think we give him one more tightener and then we move him back into the closers role
3756962 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3756963 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3756984 our shop structures were felt to be very inconsistent did not allow us to match sales patterns and did not allow adequate flexibility

3756993 wextrust purported to be a globally diversified private equity and specialist finance company specializing in investment opportunities ranging from real estate to specialty finance and investment banking
3756994 the reality as alleged in our complaint was very different
3756995 we have faked it until we made it for long enough and now we must clean it up
3756996 our complaint alleges an affinity fraud of a very large scale
3756997 in this case one of the defendants used his extensive connections in the orthodox jewish community to solicit more than 250 million from unsuspecting investors
3756998 at the age of 7 months babies will watch a fearful face for longer than a happy face and their attentiveness level as measured by eeg is higher after seeing a fearful than a happy face by contrast infants aged 5 months watch both faces when they are shown side by side for just as long and there is no difference in the intensity of attention in favour of the fearful face
3756999 our interpretation of this is to suggest that the brain mechanisms that specialise in emotional response and especially in processing threatening stimuli regulate and intensify the processing of facial expressions by age 7 months
3757000 we want to give movie and video game makers the tools necessary to animate actors and have their hair look and behave as it would in the real world

3757002 to make hair that looks like hair you have to think in terms of individual fibers
3757003 you cant just blend the highlight from two different angles to get a realistic highlight for a point in between
3757004 our method produces strands attached to the scalp that enable animation in contrast existing approaches retrieve only the visible hair layer
3757005 apart from australia and japan my samples were small and confined to young middle class urbanites nevertheless this study is unusual because it covers so many nations and the comparisons offer some interesting food for thought
3757006 overall the results show that young men and women are divided on the issues of sharing housework and a womans right to have an abortion it should come as no surprise that young women are more in favor of domestic democracy than the young men while also being more supportive of a womans right to have an abortion
3757007 it is interesting to note that those in western countries tend to see sharing housework and role reversal as similar ideas whereas most of those from asian countries who are also supportive of sharing housework were quite opposed to role reversal while this might indicate to some people that greater equality exists in the western countries another interpretation is that it demonstrates the greater commitment to the fathers bread winning role in the asian countries
3757008 while performing housework and childcare was seen as nothing short of emasculation for many of the young men in my study this does not prevent them from claiming their rights in relation to abortion decisions
3757009 the chinese people surveyed were the most accepting of a womans right to have an abortion with both males and females seeing this as her decision in some cases the chinese responses asserted that both parents had responsibilities in relation to the child but it was the womans right alone to choose an abortion
3757010 i was amazed at ehsans commitment his ideas and his dedication

3757015 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3757016 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3757017 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems

3757023 what that really means is that theyre punished through forced labor to be taught a lesson and thousands of people who have ordinary complaints or demand reforms of the chinese government have instead been rounded up
3757024 we hope amnesty international can take off the colored glasses it has worn for many years and see china in an objective way
3757025 we are confident that the games coming to china not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
3757026 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
3757027 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few web sites that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people
3757028 as in any other country there are some kinds of limitations however i think we are going to provide sufficient access for the media to cover the games
3757029 chinas political reality is a place where no freedom of expression will really be allowable this goes for the chinese people and the foreign journalists
3757030 china is always afraid that if it lets its own people speak freely and spontaneously organize by itself the chinese communist party could be endangered or even be threatened
3757031 they also feel since they got the olympics the world is coming anyway by this point they can just do what they want and just let the world tolerate rather than have to fundamentally change their own behavior
3757032 beijings public air quality reporting has been a misinformation campaign
3757033 individuals traveling to the 2008 olympic summer games should plan and prepare for the high levels of outdoor pollutant in beijing and limit or avoid outdoor exercise
3757034 this is really a significant opportunity lost for the chinese government to show to the world that they really trust their own people a sign of a china that is ready to take its place in the first ranks in the nations of the world
3757035 it isnt like climate change where you put carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and it lasts for decades air quality is a short term problem if you stop emitting your air quality could improve very quickly
3757036 its about the rate at which you pump this stuff into the atmosphere and the meteorological conditions there is not too much you can do about the latter
3757037 very very low winds high atmospheric pressure an anti cyclone building up above the city it acts like a saucepan with the lid on
3757038 the weather conditions were unique the whole of londons pollution didnt go anywhere
3757039 it is like taking a pan of soup off the hob it steams but put a lid on it and everything just sits under the lid
3757040 particles emitted are much much smaller they are not as visible people feel safer but the real problem is that because they are smaller they get deep down into the lungs where the coal particles didnt get
3757041 people who already have asthma more likely to have an asthma attack there is an impact on the number of hospital visits and there is an impact on mortality even at concentrations that many countries experience
3757042 it put a lot of babies in hospital santiago has got a ring of mountains round it and a lot of vehicles they closed a lot of factories the smog went but i dont know how much one could ascribe it to the actions taken
3757043 design star features several interior decorators are pitted against each other in various competitions until only one is left
3757044 as of this moment no single organization is adequately addressing the needs of those of us seeking to fundamentally transform the human resources function in government and other not for profit organizations by marshalling the unique resources of these two disparate organizations ipma hr and hroa we are effectively establishing a comprehensive body of knowledge that we believe will serve public servants well
3757045 as we continue to see an unprecedented number of public employees retire over the next few years it is critical that we increase our focus on talent acquisition and management human capital strategies and hr service delivery effectiveness and efficiency
3757046 this special interest group will serve as the forum for in depth discussions about these issues and the development of action plans that its members may adapt for their own purposes
3757047 i havent been able to golf much and id love to play softball again
3757048 not being able to walk the dog work around the house or garden its really restricted my life
3757049 this approach has been associated with a lower dislocation rate
3757050 it is designed to minimize muscle injury while still providing a clear view of the joint during surgery
3757051 its been well documented that complication rates are lower if you are at a hospital where these procedures are done often
3757052 that ensures the surgeons nurses and physical therapists are experienced in caring for joint replacement patients it makes for a safer environment and thats definitely the case at genesis
3757053 we continue to experience one of the more challenging retail environments in recent memory the combined effects of the downturn in the real estate market along with rising energy prices has impacted consumer spending which in turn has led to disappointing retail sales particularly for a number of our department and chain store customers although the decrease in net sales reduced our gross profit dollars during the quarter compared to last year we have been successful in achieving efficiencies in our supply chain which helped to increase our gross margin expressed as a percentage of net sales during the second quarter of 2008 we recognize however that we have more work to do in this area and hope to continue to build on this progress in the coming months
3757054 we have aggressively increased our promotional activity in response to the lackluster demand from budget conscious consumers in order to stimulate sales and maintain or build market share still we expect sales over the next several months to remain under pressure and understand the importance of controlling costs and inventory during this uncertain time one thing that will not change however is our commitment to our customers we believe that we are well positioned to weather the current economic downturn and look forward to the upcoming holiday season

3757065 after taking one or two of the wet tiled steps my feet slipped away from underneath me and i fell landing on my lower back and tailbone and ended up at the bottom of the steps
3757066 what would have happened if id lost or damaged my baby or hurt myself more seriously
3757067 how many other people have fallen on those steps how do disabled people get in and out with no lift functioning and how many mothers struggle with those steps with prams bags and other children in tow
3757068 the safety of the public using the car park is of paramount importance
3757069 there is an intermittent fault on the lift so we would rather that no one use it rather than have people getting trapped in it
3757070 the harbour commissioners made a decision that they are not prepared to risk public safety

3757080 ive never paid a dime of money to any of the people that are involved ive never asked anybody to pay a dime of money never been told that any moneys been paid
3757081 we dont know that they were illegal if they were contributions from the campaign then obviously theres some issues there with legality but at this point were still trying to investigate that
3757082 and if you take that money that people have contributed to you based upon the fact that they think their money is going to a presidential candidate and you give it to a girlfriend of a god knows what thats a crime but the question is how do you prove that and she was somehow working for the campaign as its videographer so was the money she got so inappropriately more than what she deserved thats going to be the issue the feds are going to have to look at it would be a federal offense

3757090 die berufung des dfb auf den verfassungsrechtlichen schutzauftrag der polizei berzeugt nicht es gibt n mlich kein grundrecht auf fu ball dagegen m ssen polizeiliche ma nahmen bei demonstrationen nat rlich kostenfrei bleiben denn hier wird in der tat ein grundrecht wahrgenommen das ist eben der unterschied

3757093 dies ist zum wiederholten male von seiten der polizei gewerkschaften eine populistische und oberfl chliche darstellung der dfb und die bundesliga vereine haben das gleiche recht wie alle anderen gesellschaftlichen gruppierungen dass die polizei bei ffentlichen veranstaltungen ihren dienstlichen verpflichtungen nachkommen muss

3757127 halo 3 just as halo 2 did before it presents a roadmap for the way online will be integrated into videogames in the coming years the game has been incredibly successful and attracted millions of fans but we shouldnt overlook all of the ideas that are present in the game and the remarkably robust manner in which they are presented bungie deserved to be credited for their achievements as they will help shape the future of online games
3757128 through the internet video games have evolved into a social and community based experience
3757129 with our strategic partnership with leading partner like yedang online we are poised to take a pioneering role in capitalizing on this new phenomenon

3757134 when we were recording the album we watched a series of movies featuring tom selleck
3757135 their songs allude to hate figures and love figures and there is virtually no in between
3757136 i dont see the point about writing about something youre not really pushed about
3757137 at the moment were listening to johnny foreigner and los campesinos were trying not to be prejudiced against bands that get really hyped up but at the same time some of them are actually amazing
3757138 when we were recording in seattle we had this game called brave new bands you had to go into the bargain bin in a record shop and pick out some cds then you brought them back and we all listened to them but you werent allowed know who you were listening to if you liked it you liked it we found out about a load of bands through that like mccluskey your code name is mylo rilo kiley
3757139 we got john goodmanson to produce the album because were huge blood brothers fans especially crimes we just asked him to on the blood brothers button we chose him because everything hes done has been really posh but also a bit raw
3757140 we were such melons when we were recording the ep we kept saying just make it louder
3757141 the recording was really natural the first day he asked us to just play live and he took notes he had these massive opinions on songs hed just heard so wed fight a bit generally everything would work out very easily
3757142 i tell everyone that the name came from battle of the planet of the apes truth is i stole it off a friend of mine he wanted to call his band fight like apes and i took it instead we had a laugh about it
3757143 3 of us are from dublin and marys from kildare a lot of irish bands spend a lot of time in their home town saying yeah were playing galway next year from the outset we played everywhere we could
3757144 im not going to lie obviously were going to use the most radio friendly thing as a lead single but we didnt write or record it just for the radio we wanted something quick and snappy and easy as pie
3757145 you can pre order our new single buy text message which is pretty amazing the vinyl thing something global will also be released on a limited run of special yellow vinyl was certainly something i wanted to do plus it looks great

3757237 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3757238 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3757239 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems

3757305 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3757306 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3757307 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3757308 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3757309 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3757310 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3757311 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3757312 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3757313 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3757314 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3757315 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3757316 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3757317 well im already here maybe ill hit up rosarito beach or something

3757321 bullshit im worth more than that im not even going to ask you to choose him or me im choosing right now to say
3757322 you know you were the first girl i ever loved with all my heart and you were worthy of that kind of foolish devotion until that day when you cast me aside for jim that was pretty cruel of you and it took me entirely too long to get over it but thats mostly because of my own problems not because of you its not your fault i had no self esteem to begin with but it was still pretty cruel for a beautiful girl like you to do that to a goofy kid like me
3757323 continues to evaluate opportunities to accelerate md 80 replacement with additional 737s

3757328 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3757329 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions
3757330 what we want to do is nip this in the bud by exempting the military personnel who are traveling under orders from having to pay a fee on their third bag
3757331 if you have a family at home and you stand at that airline counter and you have three bags in your hand and they say you cant get on board unless you pay 100 up front right now what are you going to do
3757332 if they pay they get reimbursed so at the end they dont pay a dime
3757333 theres a lot more on their mind than to have to worry or try to remember to get a hundred dollars reimbursed to them when they get into a war zone
3757334 we know that it is mercy who madonna really wants we heard it is because my granddaughter is such a beautiful happy child twice i have told the adoption people that i do not want mercy to go outside the country but they keep on at us now they say that mercy will be leaving us but can return at age 18 yet i might not be alive then
3757335 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3757336 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3757339 denotes a region of reality that instead of growing smaller as we grow wiser and more powerful can actually be experienced as growing larger and more incomprehensible as we solve more of our scientific and other problems it is a region of the known unknown the horizon that keeps expanding and receding into the distance the more our knowledge advances it is the arena of the incomprehensible and unspeakable that makes us aware of our ignorance of how much there yet remains to be known
3757340 we cant just keep selling chips that make graphics run faster and cheaper i mean thats all very nice and its all good but we need to advance the visual computing field in some remarkable and important way and parallel computing is one of the most important investments that we are making

3757349 kids can believe in abstinence but also intend to have sex
3757350 increasing a kids abstinence intentions has little impact on the bottom line
3757351 he may become we think confused or conflicted and those heightened abstinence intentions may make him more likely to have sex in a kind of boomerang effect
3757352 say you have a kid who is 15 or 16 and she is madly in love
3757353 she may say you know i want wait to have sex with this person we do not know each other well enough yet or i am not old enough so right now i have intentions to be abstinent but if i am still with him in a year i might consider being sexually active she has just stepped onto the sexual escalator
3757354 those teens may not have the information and tools once they are having sex to make the healthiest choices
3757355 everything you never wanted your kids to know about sex but were afraid theyd ask
3757356 but then you get past the joke and ask well until they are married
3757357 we hear confusion from kids about the term abstinence and what it means

3757404 its been a good experience for me socially as well as economically
3757405 people are well aware of global warming but it takes the price of gasoline to get them to take that step
3757406 its something they wanted to do anyway but maybe needed a little extra impetus
3757407 people have no choice at one point when the pocketbook is empty
3757408 people are kind of lazy about going beyond just posting a trip

3757411 cyberbullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
3757412 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
3757413 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
3757414 moreover the vehicle for the cyberbullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000
3757415 it would be silly hitching the train to something that has no track record to this point
3757416 there are some people who want our shows on their platform and seem to think i owe them a favor
3757417 tubemogul who i just absolutely adore thats a great example of a great product and great people behind it if i had to upload episodes of abigail to 15 places at a time i would never leave the house but because of their fantastic product its a click of a button
3757418 this is the emerging of an entirely new industry thats going to be absolutely huge
3757419 it certainly within our lifetime will become the way of distribution i think its perfect timing
3757420 could be the most effective of any missing persons notice
3757421 all he left was a note to huang her coach saying im going far away i want you to treat wenjun as your own daughter and help her do her very best
3757422 brett is a special player there is no denying that the guys had a phenomenal career
3757423 but i do believe based on what i bring to this team that i am the best fit for this team i am learning to do what coach jon gruden is asking the position to do its important that i protect the football and thats something i feel i do very well
3757424 we look into every player who is available especially every guy who we feel is a heck of a player
3757425 jeff and i had a conversation about it and weve moved on i dont feel there are any issues this is business
3757426 i really wanted and hoped to have this be my last stop
3757427 i really dont know if this is going to be the place anymore
3757428 i thought things went well enough last year to have some security but that might be a never ending battle for me
3757429 ill give you everything i have and we win games but it seems im always a stopgap for what they are hoping to establish at this position
3757430 there is something to be said about having continuity in the locker room
3757431 its one thing if theres been a breakdown at the position but that wasnt the situation here
3757432 theres a new challenge every single day whether its an x and o challenge or a personnel challenge or a relationship challenge with the players
3757433 youve got to be able to come up with an answer and youve got to be able to do it fast
3757434 when you change the culture you have to change peoples behaviors
3757435 everybody in this building administrators everybody weve told about changing the culture
3757436 it can get easy to get comfortable losing and easy to say its not my fault
3757437 when i look at it and see the team starting to come together and starting to form a personality and maybe the personality its taking on is a little bit of the head coach i start to say hey we really are doing this
3757438 i think you either live up to it or youll be shipped out thats kind of the way its going to be
3757439 they didnt want it to look like they were sucking up to the boss
3757440 they were fining each other for going to dinner with me once i got wind of it i told them i was paying all their fines then i had guys going to dinner with me all the time
3757441 were putting in new verbiage for the offense and defense im still trying to figure out whos on our roster
3757442 its important to our support staff but its the last thing on my mind
3757443 there were clocks everywhere and each clock seemingly had a little bit different time
3757444 i got all the clocks changed in the building to a digital system to really hold the players accountable for a fine or a meeting starting at the right time if the clocks were all different they can say well that clock in there said this so i did what they have in seattle and all the clocks are synchronized to one time
3757445 mediocrity in this league and in our program here can get you beat
3757446 so i like other people noticing details and getting after the detail before i have to jump in
3757447 get me a power washer and some degreaser and ill get after it

3757683 we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
3757684 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3757685 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time

3757687 huge salinisation problems i have been there seen it some of the excessive approaches to modern forms of agriculture
3757688 if you are not working with natural assistance you cause untold problems which become very expensive and very difficult to undo it places impossible burdens on nature and leads to accumulating problems which become more difficult to sort out
3757689 why else are we facing all these challenges climate change and everything
3757690 absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3757691 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3757692 if they think this is the way to go we end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness

3757702 playing arsenal will be a great experience for the players and if they dont become better players after playing against arsenal they shouldnt be in football
3757703 thats how you learn thats how you grow and playing against one of the best teams in europe obviously the players will grow from that
3757704 i know what i am who i am and the most important people to me are those around me those ive worked with
3757705 people have called me up to say we admire you because of the gamble youve taken i dont see it like that i see it as a challenge although ive had success and ive managed england i still have a lot to learn

3757715 i received a call monday saying i could qualify for the tickets if i do 12 hours of volunteer work for the obama campaign between now and friday the 15th
3757716 to work 40 hours at my job get to and from work get to and from the campaign office and complete the 12 hours in three days would be next to impossible
3757717 my whole reason why im so mad about it is because democrats need to act like democrats
3757718 democrats work for a living and they have to work and take care of their families and they say these are open to those in the community so they shouldnt ask people to drop everything in their lives for this
3757719 the history of behavior of these men including the current matter does not reflect the standard of excellence we aspire to on and off the mat

3757725 there are a number of impressive potential vice presidential candidates and this is a singular decision for one person and that is barack obama
3757726 but personally id be hopeful in the list of serious candidates to be considered would be chuck hagel whether it be for the veep position or a serious position in an obama administration
3757727 sen hagel has no intention of getting involved in any of the campaigns and is not planning to endorse either candidate
3757728 between one candidate john mccain whos always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
3757729 in the 3 years barack obama has been in the senate with all respect there is very little evidence of that kind of bipartisan outreach
3757730 john mccain has lived it worked it done it thats why i think in the end which is election day which we hope is just the beginning there are going to be many more democrats who will vote for john mccain than republicans who will vote for barack obama

3757734 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3757735 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3757736 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did

3757739 you cant help but run into members everywhere you turn theres a potential voter all 115 are just waiting and anxious to talk to you
3757740 you get a real sense of the scale and size and complexity of it all
3757741 we knew that but when you see it in person it becomes even more realistic to you
3757742 theyre accessible theres a lot of interest in 2016 developing i dont think that theyre ready yet to get into the detail of the bid but they want to know about the cities they dont give any sense of preference theyre really happy to have four world class cities
3757743 the attention is starting to turn were having much more substantive and serious conversations than ever before i have members coming up to me and wanting to know the inside scoop on our bid fortunately ive got a strong story to tell
3757744 there is a very very strong interest in the election
3757745 its amazing how great is the knowledge about the candidates
3757746 barrack obama hails from chicago and lives four blocks from the site of the opening and closing ceremony
3757747 there is no denying that barack living a few blocks from the olympic village will be more closely associated with the bid
3757748 i think it will a very important opportunity for the new president to say the u s wants the olympic movement to come back we want to welcome the whole world to chicago and the u s
3757749 the decisions are made at the last minute the advice were getting from ioc members has been stay humble and work work work until the very end thats what we will do
3757750 i just thought i could do it and i did it ive made history i have to realise this first
3757751 every game is about playing better and i need to get better personally and get the confidence in my game back
3757752 but ive got great team mates theyre working their butts off
3757753 but neither i or american coach anne donovan feel like that we still have a lot of hard yards to do

3757793 the last time i remember was in 2001 they hit me with a fishing expedition by then intelligence service of the armed forces of the philippines chief victor corpus i found out
3757794 so i hit back with the pidal expose now that they are starting again the vilification campaign using their minions including some military officers maybe if i hit back again it will be another pidal style but with a bigger magnitude
3757795 you know we never sleep in cases like this we always obtain information and it is not necessarily clean so what anomaly they have committed they should now scramble to cover this early because the moment i go to the senate floor to deliver my privilege speech they wouldnt know what hit them
3757796 i wont take this sitting down though i will strike back
3757797 the harassment against me started when i delivered my privilege speech on the nbn zte which resulted in a full senate investigation and malaca ang knew that i would not back off because they the presidential couple cant buy my silence

3757836 its hard to believe that ramu has done it again earlier after making innumerable digs at karan verma had told karan that he meant no harm karan had decided to let bygones be bygones and had declared hed invite ramu on koffee with karan its very convenient of ramu to make digs at other filmmakers like karan johar and then call them up to say he didnt mean ill but the rudeness cant be overlooked again and again

3757844 doctors dont want patients to suffer they want people to get better
3757845 but they feel stress they feel time constraints they have to deal with pre authorizations its not the kind of practice they wanted theyre stressed and that leads to moving patients along
3757846 as a doctor in todays medical system its difficult to deal with chronic pain conditions
3757847 most practices are forced to see a certain number of patients in a limited amount of time with chronic pain its not so simple as five minutes a few questions and handing out a pill it takes some time and our system isnt set up for that
3757848 the patient needs to realize that the doctor may not be able to discern whats going on in the first visit often it takes a few visits
3757849 if you say its really depressing and upsetting me im in so much pain
3757850 doctors will see it in terms of emotion and treat it as an emotional problem referring you to psychiatric care or antidepressants
3757851 patients really need to be persistent about their complaints in a way that is constructive to get across to the physician that this is something real

3757854 alex ovechkin i think is a historic player and will go down as one of those great players and great personalities
3757855 were fortunate in that hes a remarkably gifted talent but he has crossed over is he russian or north american the way he plays is north american he speaks beautiful english hes funny he has embraced the tradition of the game hes very kind to the fans hes telegenic hes embraced it all and he is one of the two faces of the new nhl with sidney crosby
3757856 i think what leagues need to be successful usually is some alchemy in that having great teams in big markets becomes important but having great stars on those great teams makes it doubly important
3757857 my belief is that the pittsburgh penguins and washington capitals will have great teams for a long period of time and well play each other a lot hopefully well meet each other in the playoffs because thats the crucible and thats when alchemy happens and where legends are made our guy understands that very much so
3757858 we made the playoffs and alex became mvp and had all four trophies hart maurice richard lester b pearson and art ross becoming the first player to do that but he said exactly the right thing
3757859 he said that he would trade all four for one stanley cup he knows to make that next jump from being a wondrous talent to going to that next plain you have to win in the playoffs
3757860 there is a belief were going to be a good team for a long long time

3758109 with respect to the defendants appeal we conclude that despite the adoption of the code of evidence by the judges of the superior court the appellate courts of this state retain the authority to develop and change the rules of evidence through case by case common law adjudication
3758110 we agree with the defendant that the adoption of the code did not divest this court of its inherent common law adjudicative authority to develop and change the rules of evidence on a case by case basis
3758111 e vidence of other crimes wrongs or acts of a person to prove the bad character or criminal tendencies of that person
3758112 the foregoing history of the adoption of the code of evidence by the judges of connecticuts superior courts does not support the conclusion however that the code was intended to divest this court of its inherent authority to change and develop the law of evidence through case by case common law adjudication
3758113 there was no discussion of the effect if any that adoption of the code would have upon this courts common law adjudicative authority to change and develop evidentiary law on a case by case basis an inherent authority that it has enjoyed since the seventeenth century
3758114 in the absence of any discussion at the meeting of the judges of the superior court concerning the impact that adoption of the code would have on the future development of evidentiary law it is illogical to conclude that by adopting the code for the purposes of ease and convenience the judges intended to divest this court of its long standing inherent common law adjudicative authority over evidentiary law
3758115 fn24 because the code merely restated the prevailing common law evidentiary rules which the judges of the superior court already were bound to apply and was intended to expedite and streamline judicial proceedings by serving as a shorthand reference to those rules the code clearly was intended to be binding authority in the superior court section 1 1 b of the code specifically states that t he c ode applies to all proceedings in the superior court in which facts in dispute are found except as otherwise provided by the c ode the general statutes or the practice book the code therefore differs fundamentally from a treatise or handbook which has persuasive value only the question presented in this appeal however is not whether the code is binding authority in the superior court but rather whether it is binding authority in this court such that we are precluded from reconsidering our own prior precedent codified in the code for the reasons explained in the body of this opinion we conclude that the judges of the superior court did not intend their adoption of the code to divest this court of its inherent authority to change and develop the law of evidence via case by case common law adjudication

3758161 im not saying that i have this all together that i have it made but i am well on my way reaching out for christ who has so wondrously reached out for me friends dont get me wrong by no means do i count myself an expert in all of this but ive got my eye on the goal where god is beckoning us onward to jesus im off and running and im not turning back

3758171 as we prepare ourselves to celebrate the solemnity of the assumption
3758172 let us again entrust ourselves to her who looks upon us at every moment from heaven with maternal love
3758173 im in no doubt at all that this is a great occasion for the liberal democrats
3758174 nick is going to be a great leader for the party he has an enormous amount of warmth and energy to bring to this job
3758175 we have ahead of us some great successes i look forward to participating as part of nicks team to make sure the party goes from strength to strength
3758176 i have certainly been very struck during the campaign at the extent to which nick has been able to reach out particularly to younger people and get them involved in the party in a way that is absolutely essential
3758177 my election as leader of this party marks a new beginning today is about two things ambition and change renewed ambition for the liberal democrats renewed ambition to reach out to the millions of people who share our values but have not yet voted for us its about renewed ambition for britain because we want to change politics and change britain
3758178 i would like to thank chris for the energetic and committed way he has campaigned in this leadership election we have been rivals in this contest from today we are colleagues again i look forward to working closely with him for the good of liberalism in britain
3758179 i would also like to thank vince cable for the magnificent way he has led the party in these past two months there are few men who have excelled as an economist a comedian and a ballroom dancer
3758180 finally i would like to give my warmest thanks on behalf of the whole party to ming campbell he took over the liberal democrats at a difficult time and provided enormous stability and professionalism to the party without his work building on the extraordinary achievements of charles kennedy and paddy ashdown before him the party would not have the bright future which it now does
3758181 i am a liberal by temperament by instinct and by upbringing my own family was marked scattered and reunited by the tragic conflicts of the last century i was taught from an early age that britain was a place of tolerance and pluralism with a history steeped in democracy and the rule of law
3758182 i believe that liberalism is the thread that holds together everything this country stands for pull out that thread and the fabric of the nation unravels
3758183 we are a people with a strong sense of fair play and social justice an instinct to protect the environment for future generations we are suspicious of arbitrary power wary of government interference we want to play an active enlightened role in the affairs of the world and we have always put our faith in the power of ordinary men and women to change things for the better
3758184 so why is britain still not the liberal nation we want it to be look around us our civil liberties casually cast aside gigantic faceless and incompetent government bureaucracies security and opportunity in short supply particularly in the poorest communities families struggling to meet each months bills struggling to balance the demands of work and the time for a real family life
3758185 above all our politics is broken out of step with people out of step with the modern world that is why i have one sole ambition to change britain to make it the liberal country the british people want it to be
3758186 i want a new politics a peoples politics i want to live in a country where rights freedoms and privacy are not the playthings of politicians but safeguarded for everyone where political life is not a westminster village freak show but open accessible and helpful in peoples everyday lives
3758187 where parents pupils and patients are in charge of our schools and hospitals where fine words on the environment are translated into real action where social mobility becomes a reality once again so that no one is condemned by the circumstances of their birth
3758188 why have we stopped imagining a better society look at what weve got the conservatives and new labour have governed in the same way top down and centralising
3758189 i refuse to believe that the only alternative to a clapped out labour government is a conservative party which has no answers to the big issues environmentalism without substance social justice without money internationalism without europe
3758190 the challenge for my party is clear and simple to define a liberal alternative to the discredited politics of big government i want to open up my party open up westminster and open up politics for good
3758191 to lead well a leader needs to listen thats why i will hold regular and public town hall meetings thats why i want to open up the liberal democrats to give people who support us but arent members a say on the big issues thats why i will spend at least one day every week listening and campaigning outside westminster
3758192 thats why i will set up a network of real families who have nothing to do with party politics in every region of this country to advise me on what they think should be my priorities
3758193 if you once voted lib dem but think weve spent too much time focusing on ourselves if you once voted conservative but dont know what they stand for any more if you once voted labour but feel let down after ten years of disappointment if youve given up voting altogether but still care about the world we live in then a newly united energetic optimistic liberal democrat party is there for you
3758194 this is an unprecedented time of opportunity for liberalism in britain if we are to grab this opportunity my party will need to change we must start acting like the growing national political movement that we are more professional more united more ambitious
3758195 liberalism is the creed of our times the old left right politics has broken down labour and the conservatives are mutating into each other united in defence of a system which has let the people down instead we must start where people are not where we think they should be
3758196 in short i want the liberal democrats to be the future of politics because liberal democrats have the courage to imagine a better society to break the stifling grip of the two party system for good to bring in a new politics of politicians who listen to people not themselves
3758197 i believe there is less control in truth in advertising in the spanish media than the english media because ive seen these outrageous claims being made about vitamins and other products
3758198 but i am actually very impressed with the spanish media in terms of their news coverage they have a built in commitment to getting out a lot of information on health issues especially with diabetes
3758199 when asked about why they lack a usual provider 41 percent say the principal reason is that they are seldom sick
3758200 the pool of individuals who are u s born and have insurance still make up a huge number
3758201 for individuals who have chronic issues this is a very unhealthy issue click to enlarge gregg miller staff photographer serious problem
3758202 i feel healthy but two years ago i broke my ankle playing soccer and since that day i had to see a doctor and to buy health insurance
3758203 for latino people who watch a lot of tv everything that tv says is true
3758204 i dont feel comfortable because the exam is not in my language
3758205 somewhere out there in that chaos of darkness and light of science and protons of gods and stars and death somewhere theres an answer
3758206 martha jones ex time traveller and now working as a doctor for a un task force has been called to cern the worlds largest particle physics laboratory in geneva where theyre about to activate the large hadron collider lhc
3758207 the lhc is a particle accelerator which has been built deep underground in a 27 km tunnel under switzerland and france once activated the collider will fire beams of protons together recreating conditions a billionth of a second after the big bang and potentially allowing the human race a greater insight into what the universe is made of
3758208 but so much could go wrong it could open a gateway to a parallel dimension or create a black hole and now voices from the past are calling out to people and scientists have started to disappear
3758209 i am hugely excited by the team i am announcing today it demonstrates the vast talent in the liberal democrat party i look forward to working with them to take forward my agenda and my messages to engage with the real concerns of the public
3758210 under my leadership the liberal democrats will be ambitious ambitious for ourselves and ambitious for britain
3758211 i want to thank you for giving me the chance to lead our great party it is a privilege to follow in the footsteps of paddy ashdown charles kennedy and ming campbell who have all contributed so much to our party i look forward to working with them all during my leadership
3758212 i would also like to pay tribute to both vince cable and chris huhne vince has been an inspiration as stand in leader with both his forensic questioning and his memorable put downs chris and i saw a lot of each other during the leadership contest now we will be working together as close colleagues to ensure that our party goes on to further electoral success i am delighted that both vince and chris are going to be part of my top team over the coming years
3758213 we have a golden opportunity for our party gordon brown presides over an increasingly stale incompetent and desperate government david cameron and the tories dont know what they stand for any more
3758214 we know what we stand for a more liberal britain i am confident that with hard work and dedication we can turn our beliefs into reality and change our country for the better

3758262 10 august mean that the main lines of polarisation that have dominated bolivian politics since moraless election are left entrenched and the long stalemate over implementation of a new constitution among other reforms seems set to continue an ascendant regionalism the regional divide between bolivias highland west and lowland east has a long history but previous governments in la paz have consistently maintaining a centralised administrative system and refused to cede to pressure for devolution before 2005 the office of prefect was a presidential appointment charged mainly with upholding law and order at the local level the movimiento revolucionario nacionalista mnr traditionally the countrys main party fiercely resisted decentralisation fearing that the countrys already fragile unity would be placed at risk in 2005 faced by moraless victory at the national level opposition leaders including in a twist of history those of the now much diminished mnr were swift to realise that local politics could be fruitful terrain for the political initiative the election of prefects turned a bureaucratic post into a springboard for regional leadership by contrast the now ruling mas was slow to realise this potential when selecting its candidates for the 2005 elections it gave little importance to the prefectures and chose to select its best people for ostensibly more important posts in the senate and chamber of deputies in part result it won a mere three of the countrys nine prefectures this cost the mas dear the most potent source of opposition to morales has come not from national parties or their leaders but from those prefects who have managed to identify themselves as champions of local interests this much became clear in may june 2008 when the prefects of the so called media luna half moon departments the lowland departments of santa cruz tarija beni and pando held bolivias democratic tides

3758590 we obviously return a group that has had significant playing time and experienced a good deal of success
3758591 there is no doubt we will be talented but the challenge is getting the team to continually raise their level and expectations i am excited about the amount of upperclassmen that should highly impact our work ethic commitment and drive as a team we enjoyed our 2007campaign but we have our sights set on bigger accomplishments this fall our goal will continue to be basic we must outwork our opponents at everything we do
3758592 we will rely on this senior class to help set the standard on and off the court

3758603 kelsey and her 6 3 physical build will add depth to our height and power in the position she is a focused athlete with tremendous potential i have no doubt she will be very successful in our system and in our conference

3758605 she improves every year and is a dedicated player mariana is an athlete that naturally moves around the court she is understanding systematic volleyball better which will continue to help her grow christine is still developing but great to work with because she is hungry to learn she has one of the toughest serves on the team which we still plan on using our setters are the backbone of our offense and their on court leadership will be crucial to the overall success in 2008
3758606 augy is a fundamentally sound defensive player as well as one of our primary passers she is very confident in her role as our libero and i will expect her to set the standard defensively everyday she has the ability to be one of the best liberos in the conference
3758607 they are anxious to be given on court responsibilities they also understand the areas that need improvement in order to get those opportunities they are both hard working and full of energy on defense they both help set the defensive tone in the gym which is very important
3758608 the 2008 schedule brings new challenges to our experienced squad
3758609 our high level of out of conference competition is designed to prepare us for the rigors of the big east

3758688 they had a great meet a great day and they deserve that medal
3758689 give us another day and maybe well come out on top
3758690 before this i said i would feel that no matter if it is failure or victory it will be wonderful
3758691 that is what i told myself so no matter the final results i was able to feel very calm
3758692 after falling off the beam i told myself i need to do well for the rest of the routine and perform my best so i quickly adjusted myself
3758693 in this sport you know there are two reasons youre going to be held one is for scoring one is for television
3758694 in no way shape or form are we blaming anyone for this
3758695 i was just really eager to do my routine and get the show on road pretty much but they did hold me for some time i guess i let my nerves get the best of me
3758696 she kept telling us she was sorry but its really hard to know what to say
3758697 you know she obviously didnt purposely make the mistake it was obvious it was just a mistake

3758702 as we roll the concept to all best buy stores in the u s were seeing a 10 fold year over year increase in smart phone purchases
3758703 one cannot claim to be an animal protection advocate and threaten violence against other people even if we disagree with what they are doing this behavior is antithetical to the core principles of the humane movement
3758704 while pacelles statement makes sense he does not directly condemn illegal activities which have become commonplace with those embracing the animal liberation philosophy
3758705 just over two weeks ago karen davis president of united poultry concerns was an invited speaker at hsus annual taking action for animals conference davis is notorious for her claim that the september 11 terrorist attacks reduced the amount of suffering in the world because many of those killed in the attack likely ate chicken for more click here where were pacelles convictions in mid july

3758707 load the brushes because the file is not compatible with this version of photoshop
3758708 could not complete my request because it is not the right kind of document
3758709 dont the consprazoids wonder why zero of their fantasies have panned out
3758710 because the south ossetians were bombarding georgian villages and because saakashvili isnt olmert and so actually did something when his people were being murdered from afar by artillery
3758711 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3758712 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3758713 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3758714 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3758715 a number of girls were on the short list for the show and lin was the best actress while yang had the best voice
3758716 so at the end of the day they decided to have both
3758717 however because of the poor visibility of the night some previously recorded foots may have been used
3758718 i do not think the chinese state realises how unethical this is they dont understand what kind of values they are reflecting
3758719 big browns camp recent remarks about curlin inspired me to offer an incentive to get these two great horses to race at the legendary track at the spa
3758720 both horses are eligible for this race and both have plenty of time to prepare for what would be thoroughbred racing at its very best and in the name of a great cause
3758721 this type of competition between horses is exactly what thoroughbred racing needs an event that introduces the excitement and competition of racing to a broader audience
3758722 imagine horse of the year curlin racing against derby winner big brown on a legendary track

3758730 i didnt have to listen to people yelling or bickering and complaining it was my escape
3758731 i took a lot of anger and beat it out just me and the bottom of the pool

3758735 seven years of college down the drain might as well join the f ing peace corps
3758736 and who cares if the applicants passed the exam after studying in the local public library
3758737 they should join the military instead and learn to love their country
3758738 they should join the military instead and learn to love their country
3758739 a bachelors degree tells an employer nothing except that the applicant has a certain amount of intellectual ability and perseverance
3758740 a bachelors degree tells an employer only that the applicant has a certain amount of intellectual ability and perseverance
3758741 its not about the education it is about the perseverance
3758742 ok but does it have to take four years and cost 125 000 i cant believe that the particular set of job skills you cite couldnt be imparted more quickly and cheaply and with less political indoctrination
3758743 is not associated with a structural transition in which the share of manufactures in total output is growing except for most asian ldcs

3758745 skeletal preparation can be an interesting and rewarding project for those who recognize that beauty and have the stomach for the grosser side of biology
3758746 if a student chooses to do the skeletal preparation the dissection is not performed at the school but is done at the students home with parental consent and supervision
3758747 the teacher will okay this project only after a permission slip with a parent or guardians signature is returned to the school
3758748 the teacher stated that at no time did he direct any of his students to go to the animal control center or the humane society to collect a speciman
3758749 offered to provide her with a euthanized animal if it was for a school project
3758750 and thats the end of their little lives and its rather unpleasant so if somehow some way one of these animals can somehow help a student or help an educational program or enhance a life maybe in the future and stimulate some young mind to become a scientist or an investigator of some sort i feel like thats a worthy cause
3758751 it doesnt behoove us to pit ourselves against russia russia is a strategic partner
3758752 madonnas representatives have been visiting the girl the adoption is now advanced all the government is waiting for is madonna to forward the petition of adoption formalities then mercy will be able to leave the country for a new life

3758754 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3758755 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3758756 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3758759 wir hoffen dass saakaschwili aus georgien verschwindet es w re interessant zu wissen warum er das getan hat er hat nur 10 000 soldaten und ging gegen russland vor
3758760 wir stehen nicht allzu schlecht da wir haben vier jahre mit georgien gearbeitet und eine niederlage erlitten schuld daran tragen alle
3758761 russland ist in diesen krieg getreten um den westen herauszufordern der westen erwies sich als machtlos wir haben es mit einem neuen russland zu tun
3758762 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3758763 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3758764 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3758765 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3758766 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3758767 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3758768 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3758769 the rx 400h is the first and remains the only hybrid suv on the market this gives customers a unique proposition of suv style and practicality with lower fuel consumption and emissions
3758770 in what is a tough market overall this gives our lexus centres a great advantage in being able to offer the type of car customers want but without the penalties in running costs they would incur with models from rival brands
3758771 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3758772 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3758773 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3758774 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3758818 i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged
3758819 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
3758820 it is critical our community be an integral and active part of the debate because african americans are disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change economically socially and through our health and well being
3758821 there is a certain disconnect between what is good for workers consumers managers and the economy on one hand and stockholders on the other
3758822 we found that the combination of efficient market instruments return of the revenue cost effective promotion of new clean technologies and efficiency and targeted policies for low income households grows the economy it increases employment and profits overall and provides a net benefit for consumers
3758823 eliminate the financial burden on low income and moderate income households
3758824 however this increase in profits may be smaller than the windfall to stockholders if allowances are given away for free even though this windfall is partially offset by higher product prices lower sales lower production and lower profits on the firms output exclusive of the value of the allowances
3758825 most businesses are energy consumers not producers and their interests lie with household energy consumers

3758835 even allowing for the exceptional levels of rainfall experienced in recent days householders should not have had to stand by and experience the trauma of seeing their homes damaged and property destroyed by flooding
3758836 despite the threat posed by climate change the irish government has simply not taken this issue as seriously as other governments of other eu countries including britain
3758837 this is borne out by low level of spending on flood relief schemes in last three years
3758838 despite the work of the office of public works in implementing some of the measures recommended by the flood strategy review group including the mapping of flood hazard areas there has been no major policy changes in how the authorities in ireland manage flood risk
3758839 the government needs a new strategic approach to the management of flooding including
3758840 flooding results in huge economic and social damage and cost the state individuals and business huge money in clean up and insurance it is important however to factor in the huge cost of flooding in human terms including risk to life
3758841 flooding has always being with us but it is being exacerbated by factors including building and it is likely to become more frequent and more severe as a result of climate change

3758847 there are many reasons why i decided to depart late for the games in the past we faced lots of documentation problems when everyone has left for the games secondly the secretary general and administrative secretary are out due to illness and the typist could not have been able to sort out other arriving correspondents from the games

3758876 we have an economy which is diversified we have a workforce that we have upgraded year by year better educated better able to earn more because we are connected with the world and our incomes can rise because of our higher skills and higher technology
3758877 we have succeeded so far in housing in health in education in job facilities we will do our best to re train people who are being retrenched to upgrade their skills but we must face facts this gap is going to remain for five ten or more years
3758878 we had been concerned for the last 48 hours theres definitely something there thats causing lameness

3758889 we usually dont host national level events hopefully the weather stays nice and everyone has a good time
3758890 it is great that the ewga championships are being held at bristol harbour
3758891 the ewga is a great organization and bristol harbour is a beautiful challenging golf course this combination should result in some great golf and exciting moments i plan on taking my three daughters to watch
3758892 i love playing at bristol harbour its my all time favorite course
3758893 i think i might have a chance at doing really well at low net because i highly doubt any of the other competitors have competed on this course

3758902 the gradient of time in the country and being born in the country or outside the country has a lot to do with how people perceive and experience the health care system and especially the deficits of that system
3758903 if you compare these numbers to those from the u s centers for disease control and prevention latinos are more than twice as likely to lack a usual health care provider
3758904 we found a number of characteristics of health care access that are particular to latinos
3758905 among people who have health insurance 19 percent lacked a usual health care provider compared to 42 percent of people who lack health insurance
3758906 this suggests that its not only financial reasons that are keeping latinos from doctors
3758907 among those people who reported they were not satisfied with their health care the most common reason why they received poor health care was financial
3758908 they felt that their health care professional did not provide good care because they did not have the means to pay for the health care

3758915 when the economy takes a turn for a worse everyone starts tightening their belts
3758916 but one place that is often overlooked is the amount of taxes they pay
3758917 we have found that the wealthiest people in the country are paying as little as 5 of their income in taxes while the average person is paying upwards of 30 50 of their income in taxes
3758918 its amazing how im going to save and how much this is going to help me this year it looks like im going to save 30 000 in taxes
3758919 meaning that half of the income that i usually pay in taxes im going to get to keep
3758920 it is important for people to realize that americans are making far more money than they are actually taking home
3758921 a very large percentage of their weekly salary is lost to taxes before they ever cash a check this money can be recovered and used to pay for rising expenses when you realize just how much money you are losing right off the top tax savings is like getting an instant pay raise from the government

3758964 the global models are good for investigating whats likely to happen on a planetary scale but the resolution is quite coarse when looking at a more localised regional scale
3758965 its a bit like enlarging a digital photograph until it becomes pixellated and all sorts of detail is blurred out
3758966 simulating the climate of the region is a challenge for climate models due in part to the high natural inter annual variability the topography of the region which includes multiple mountain ranges and inland seas and the presence of a slight cooling trend in recent decades despite the global trend being a warming
3758967 we need to confirm this result with other models but a 50 per cent increase in rainfall in such an important agricultural area is a much more hopeful scenario than a 15 per cent decline

3758989 id like to calm everybody down the russian military is not advancing towards the capital
3758990 the tanks just rolled past us with their guns at the ready definitely looking like they were ready to engage
3758991 its the same scenes as we were seeing at the beginning of the conflict as far as the people here are concerned the politicians may be talking about peace but theres really no sign of it here
3758992 no it doesnt make sense to pay off a loan and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
3758993 you have an auto loan at 8 but your car is depreciating so i wouldnt worry about paying that off and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
3758994 you have credit card debt at 15 but i wouldnt worry about paying it off because you used the card to buy gold coins and they are appreciating so you have a lot of equity there
3758995 if the vacancy occurs less than sixty 60 days before the august election but sixty 60 days or gun seizure update
3758996 the polar regions are barometers of change for the climate of the earth as a whole the 19 million square kilometers of sea ice that form each winter had been a blind spot so far and the seals help us fill in that part of the story
3758997 animals that carry tags are just as good at foraging just as good at catching food as animals without them
3758998 longer term they have just the same sort of survival rates as animals that dont carry them so theres no effect on the seals and the few seals that are out there collecting this data are doing an enormous service if you like to broader science and also to their own species
3758999 many plant species could lose their niches in habitats such as mountains or moors

3759007 we dont want to get ahead of ourselves but hopefully well look back at 2007 as the year we turned the corner
3759008 we were competitive in every game except maryville what we did was prove to ourselves that we really could compete with anybody on our schedule
3759009 i coached both of them and theres no question in my mind about that comparison
3759010 thats a huge compliment to weston and it has to do with his football savvy toughness and work ethic
3759011 darians quarterback rating probably suffered because his arm is so strong hed often throw it right into kids hands and they couldnt handle it
3759012 he also forced some passes into tight spots every interception he had was probably on a play where he thought he could zip it in there
3759013 weston and darian are just playmakers darian has all the tools to be a big time guy but to me it all starts with weston any time youve got that kid youve got a chance
3759014 but we didnt scrimmage anybody anytime you bring in a new system it is important they learn that first and do not worry about who they are playing
3759015 we dont know what they did last year and dont really care
3759016 while the book remains a work of fiction it has an underlying reference to emedha philosophy which is a realistic paradigm for it world this unique combination of a new it paradigm being presented through a fictious storyline will make this book an interesting read

3759018 i decided right when i got out of surgery that i was walking and i was ready to go
3759019 everybody told me to slow it down coaches were worried about me even to this day it kind of gets on my nerves im not going to lie but its all right
3759020 after coming off a knee injury i dedicated my life to this game and to this team
3759021 i wanted to be ready for this first game ready to do what i do and do my best at it
3759022 we have some guys who played in backup roles who we expected to evolve into starters this year and i think theyll do a pretty good job for us rebuilding i guess you could call it that
3759023 you could see that last year when he got out on the field he has a good head for the game i feel confident with him as the new quarterback handling it and throwing it i think hell be able to throw it this year

3759029 dont buy vanguards total bond market index fund because it contains mortgage backed securities
3759030 this fund is an excellent choice to anchor most investors bond portfolios especially those unwilling to take on substantial credit risk it boasts low expenses broad diversification and experienced management
3759031 compare the growth of a hypothetical 10 000 investment in this fund with the growth of the same amount in up to 2 other vanguard funds and a benchmark to get an accurate comparison choose a time range that covers the number of years all funds have been in existence move your mouse over the graph to see the changes in returns

3759038 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
3759039 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
3759040 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

3759055 weve never had a season like that i dont know how much better we couldve performed but i feel like i didnt do a good job in many areas
3759056 the guys last season didnt have the same mindset as in years past
3759057 we used to have guys that got angry if they lost it made them sick to lose thats such a key in high school football mindset it matters more than just relying on talent and athleticism
3759058 theres not a lot of room for tolerance this year if the upperclassmen will lead the next couple seasons could get back to being productive
3759059 and were looking for big things out of him this season
3759060 he had his surgery and three weeks later i caught him out back playing football after school
3759061 hes one of those kids who doesnt like sitting still doing nothing hes been testing himself and luckily he made it through he was a quick recoverer
3759062 he gives our offense hope that at any moment he can take it the distance
3759063 you got to have those kinds of kids to give your other players confidence that theres always a chance that if i do my job we could score on this play
3759064 ive always been interested in this job and the potential to have a respectable football program and something the community can be proud of
3759065 when all this started taking place in may of 2007 we werent talking wins and losses but getting these kids to believe in themselves and believe in hard work and talent
3759066 our biggest gain was mental toughness we got in the weight room
3759067 hes had it in his mind about playing quarterback all through winter workouts
3759068 hes a real smart kid a straight a student he played there quarterback in middle school hes made big strides but has a ways to go
3759069 we have a schedule that will allow us to compete and have a good chance on friday nights
3759070 weve got a chance to get in the playoffs it depends how we approach it mentally we have to believe in our style of offense and defense and senior leadership will play an important role too
3759071 weve had a good off season weve gotten stronger gotten quicker weve got to mentally believe we can win football games
3759072 david ray does not dispute the fact that name deleted accompanied him and her grandfather while deer hunting in november 2005 and november 2006 but he denies having any sexual contact with her on either hunting trip it is understood that the accuser in these cases is not withdrawing her allegations
3759073 were probably gonna have the best team weve had in my five years here
3759074 our strength is up front on both sides of the ball
3759075 we want to make it so no one can run on us
3759076 we want to be able to stop the run and take other teams out of their offense
3759077 o j has put on about 15 pounds since last season and gotten a lot faster he had about 950 yards rushing last year and averaged over 10 yards a carry were looking for big things from him
3759078 jason hasnt played that much football but he has gotten a lot bigger and stronger he has really stepped up and were excited about him
3759079 last year norwood would have been lucky to break 5 flat in the 40 this year he has run a 4 6 and has worked extremely hard
3759080 thats our first region game if we win that one were in good shape if not were in an uphill battle in the region
3759081 during our freshman year we always talked about wanting to be the class that goes out on top
3759082 we want to set the bar for future south doyle teams
3759083 these guys want to compete for a state as well as a region championship
3759084 andre was special and we had a real good senior group last year these guys learned what it takes from that group
3759085 people arent looking at us to be that good but weve set our goals high
3759086 after winning the region last year and having that taste in our mouth our goal is to repeat
3759087 those three running backs all came through in the spring for us
3759088 reese browning is a very talented quarterback he can certainly make things happen
3759089 we are talking every day about being better we havent talked a lot about wins and losses but our focus is on whatever it takes to ensure we are a better football team today than yesterday
3759090 i am hoping that the biggest thing they are going to give is leadership
3759091 we did not perform well in last years game and it is important that we establish that we are ready to take the fight to them
3759092 i hope we strive for excellence and forget about what happened in the past
3759093 i hope we can stick together as a team and get a bunch of wins and host a playoff game
3759094 he came on the scene last year and had a big year
3759095 for a first year starter to have 2 500 yards is a big year he is a skill player who can throw and run
3759096 offensively we have set a pretty good foundation with a new offensive scheme and a lot of kids returning
3759097 and defensively we added some kids in the secondary to go with those up front that gives us a chance to compete
3759098 with these two in the secondary we expect to be vastly improved
3759099 we want to put it out of reach in the first half
3759100 we had peaks and valleys but that is what we are trying to get through
3759101 we need to finish off teams when we have them down

3759105 give us another day and maybe well come out on top
3759106 before this i said i would feel that no matter if it is failure or victory it will be wonderful
3759107 that is what i told myself so no matter the final results i was able to feel very calm
3759108 after falling off the beam i told myself i need to do well for the rest of the routine and perform my best so i quickly adjusted myself
3759109 in this sport you know there are two reasons youre going to be held one is for scoring one is for television
3759110 in no way shape or form are we blaming anyone for this
3759111 i was just really eager to do my routine and get the show on road pretty much but they did hold me for some time i guess i let my nerves get the best of me
3759112 she kept telling us she was sorry but its really hard to know what to say
3759113 you know she obviously didnt purposely make the mistake it was obvious it was just a mistake
3759114 as i speak russian tanks are attacking the town of gori
3759115 let the world finally wake up and take action and provide security for the region we are creating a situation that could get out of hand
3759116 they were stationed there to protect the population from irregular fighters who were reported to be stealing cars in the area
3759117 today the georgian ambassador to the netherlands filed a law suit to the international court of justice called the state of georgia against the state of russia because of ethnic cleansing conducted in georgia by russia in 1993 to 2008
3759118 though agricultural commodity prices have moderated they remain quite favorable by historical standards and are continuing to provide strong support to farm incomes and to the sale of productive farm machinery worldwide
3759119 committed to helping ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year
3759120 its the season for traveling and last year the hotel was full the olympics should have brought business to beijing but the reality is too far from the expectation
3759121 dad how did this one team almost blow a 10 run first inning lead
3759122 epic squander and they would have got nothing if not for vazquez
3759123 fucking squander squad i cant wait to hear what tito will say after this loss cant wait
3759124 hey shit for brains instead of letting the hose rip some guys mustang pick the fucking thing up
3759125 i blame this suckfest on zink shaving his head before the game he was doing exceptionally down in pawtucket with a full head of hair doesnt he understand anything about baseball dont mess with whats working
3759126 we wont know if my ideas on iraq would have worked because they werent implemented
3759127 it is difficult to argue that the courts opinion is not constitutionally suspect
3759128 we tried to get as many co sponsors as we could and we postured the thing as anti vigilante violence
3759129 we argued that even if you oppose abortion you should not condone these actions
3759130 there were a number of very anti choice senators who voted for face
3759131 theres been a bit of tension for some time they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3759132 they have spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms
3759133 i have a responsible grown up life but peel back the trousers and i am a hot blooded undieboi
3759134 we are suspending craig emmerling without pay for 30 days
3759135 if this goes beyond the 30 day period we will convert it to a paid suspension
3759136 as a resident of the town of richmond and a parent of children who have participated in the richmond recreation program i have been concerned with the suspension of the recreation director as have many others
3759137 doesnt the suspension and the extension of suspension of a town employee require a vote by law
3759138 he was warned once before about his behavior there are good people out there who can do his job
3759139 the world bank has become very dependent on fossil fuel loans in order to maintain its own financial strength says vijaya ramachandran senior fellow at the center for global development the center a washington research group ranks the worlds top greenhouse gas emitters and figures that the tata plant will be no 42 this shouldnt be happening on his watch says david wheeler chief economist of the world banks development research group from 1993 to 2006
3759140 these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack
3759141 the corn yield at 155 is a pretty impressive recovery to say the least
3759142 im really surprised that they had the numbers to justify that high a yield out there considering that we are so delayed on the crop in general
3759143 kevin recession is the sequel to kevin07 and australia needs strong economic leadership
3759144 theyre deciding on paternity leave but nobody in australia really knows what effect it may have if dads stay home with their children
3759145 we need to bring fathers into the discussion but the research isnt there
3759146 the chances are that we are using a lot of energy and taxpayers money throwing money at problems without being able to address them effectively
3759147 we know that fathers have an effect on literacy and breastfeeding rates but usually the lactation consultants only talk to the mums
3759148 we need to define clearly the notion of fatherhood and understand its relationship to motherhood
3759149 the debate has been largely framed from the mothers perspective either from a traditional standpoint that its womens work or from a feminist standpoint that its definitely womens work
3759150 the whole area of male role models fatherhood male involvement in childrearing has never been sufficiently investigated and needs attention
3759151 gender roles are changing and couples with children are having to navigate and negotiate that
3759152 when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers
3759153 i think that means that theres no obvious reason that the banks could not pass through any change in the cash rate
3759154 so the fact that the cost of borrowing money has dropped over the last 10 days has had limited impact
3759155 basically we have a situation where all of the term deposits are rolling over at the moment at a higher rate of around 150 200 basis points and all of the long term funding we are rolling over at a higher rate
3759156 the good news is that in a pinch the rba has a big 7 25 percentage points to work with
3759157 if youre a bank generating significant profits i would say that those banks owe it to working families where working australians are under financial pressure that when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers
3759158 far from protecting the rights of dead children this law will protect their killers
3759159 but when a child has died how can there be justice if no one knows who they are or who killed them
3759160 the reality is that suspected killers will fall below the radar of public and media attention if their child victims cant be named
3759161 my current manager is doing a good job but there are always options in life and you only have to look at the stars nasser has already got
3759162 it depends on what is being said at your club he said hinting at williams attack on coach steve folkes and suggestions of racism
3759163 i see myself as a rugby league player right now but you never know everyone has got their own opinion of what sonny did but he was looking after his own backyard which is understandable
3759164 choc is a great role model because hes outspoken he has balls inglis said
3759165 and despite all the criticism hes faced he wont back down to anyone
3759166 everyone needs to be heard and choc gets out there and says what he thinks
3759167 greg said if im doing anything i will be doing it with you youre my manager thats it
3759168 ive been right through that with him his parents and everything
3759169 he cant afford to have his image or reputation tarnished the way the other bloke williams has
3759170 bellyache coach craig bellamy who is very close to him has been in his ear about that gregs sensible enough to know
3759171 theyve been speaking regularly for 10 years their families are close gregs under contract for two years and hes guaranteed everyone he definitely wont be walking out
3759172 all the speculation has been amusing to greg and to us
3759173 greg is not the type of person to break a contract and is on record as saying he doesnt like rugby union
3759174 its a shock i havent heard it from her i would have expected an e mail
3759175 pauline was getting over the election loss and deciding whether to stay in politics
3759176 i am open to offers and i think that a farmer wants a wife is interesting and some of those people have met their ideal matches and i think thats wonderful i would dearly love to meet someone who i can spend the rest of my life with and have that companionship with
3759177 i think she would be brilliant in the media as a political commentator but not on reality tv that would be a mistake
3759178 or she would be brilliant at hosting maybe something like oprah
3759179 i dont think she would have a problem finding mr right thats why i think it is so bizarre
3759180 theres two main things that will assist in saving peoples lives the first is having an adequate amount of fire alarms and the other is that everyone knows the way out in darkness and confusion
3759181 the legislation is that you only need one working smoke alarm per level in every home but we say you should have a working smoke alarm in every bedroom and in the hallway
3759182 we also recommend that they be wired into the main electrical system and all are inter connected so alarms go off at the same time so you know there is a problem in the home
3759183 the association is aware of the amount of hours ministerial drivers do
3759184 it must be risk assessed and we are in continuing discussions with the premiers office over ways to deal with these issues

3759189 dad was an immigrant a self made man he had no education but he was energetic driven and humorous
3759190 this house was their dream its a beautiful block and they had put an extraordinary amount of time and effort into the place
3759191 i asked him not long ago why he had spent so long on the garden but only just started the house he said son you can build a house in a year but it takes 10 to grow a garden
3759192 all i have to say to other owner builders is that i would never wish anything like this horrible tragedy to happen to anyone else
3759193 this is a situation where poor practices have culminated in one fatality and two hospitalisations
3759194 they have spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms but unless john has a dramatic change of heart its unlikely theyll rekindle their romance
3759195 i think many of our problems as a country would be solved if people had thick passports theres just no substitute for actually going and seeing things

3759200 the last time we saw henry was the day before we left san francisco for phoenix as he was stumbling through the center of the park talking frantically to himself shaking his fists wildly at the sky
3759201 whatever you did for one of the least of these you did for me
3759202 whatever you did not do for one of the least of these you did not do for me ultimately it doesnt matter whether henry or the man who thinks hes jesus are clinically diagnosed as mentally ill or spiritually described as demon possessed neither label gets us off the hook of what we are called to do and be in their lives
3759203 all i can say for now is that the police are soon to make a breakthrough in the case we will provide more information at a suitable time soon
3759204 there is no way you can tell people that you were asleep throughout the entire offloading process mind you it was a truck offloading 20 drums surely that is bound to wake any one of us up
3759205 weve been getting calls from neighbors and people driving by theres a dog trapped on the island
3759206 and so when the action in georgia happened on thursday he immediately called for a ceasefire condemned the unwarranted use of force by russia it was a bad crisis for the world it required tough words but also a smart approach to call on the international community to step in and im very very happy that the senators request for a ceasefire has been complied with by president medvedev
3759207 skateboarding is not just a california scene weve got some excellent skaters on the east coast that deserve the attention mainly given to skaters on the west coast and through this merger we hope to bring that attention not only to the skaters but to the entire area

3759213 we are appealing to churches of various religions in the province as they gather here in this summit to understand that they can play a huge role in changing society
3759214 our country is experiencing challenges which need churches to come together and look at how these challenges can be addressed with their contribution
3759215 fostering a caring self reliant society that upholds human dignity
3759216 we said earlier this year that we needed to strengthen the partnership with all the stakeholders and this summit with the religious community presents us with that opportunity
3759217 the churches already have structures in place to help the needy and that is where we want to come in because they already operate in an organised manner
3759218 challenges of crime rape racism abuses and poverty and unemployment will be better addressed if we better engage churches in our society
3759219 all our districts have already laid the groundwork for such a relationship and we are confident we will make it work and deliver tangible benefits to the masses of our people

3759239 as i speak russian tanks are attacking the town of gori
3759240 i saw russian planes bombing our villages and killing our soldiers but i could not do anything and this will always be with me
3759241 kudos to amendola communications a two time award winner for this high achievement being lauded by the media is a strong vote of confidence and one of the highest awards that an agency can receive the prestigious award identifies agencies nationwide that deliver the greatest value to the editorial process and amendola communications is clearly a leader in its category

3759243 were going to be relatively well off compared to other states but were going to suffer as the national economy has its challenges
3759244 he will probably propose what is in the best interests of his vice presidential ambitions
3759245 we looked into it reviewed the file and felt that payment was necessary
3759246 theres a real uniqueness to this case and thats why we decided to follow through with payment to cover the drug and medical costs of the family
3759247 his case points to the need to take a hard look at the health care system
3759248 there certainly will be others come forward we have people approaching the ministry all the time asking for out of province coverage some are covered some arent
3759249 because we brought it forward is not the reason why were following through with payment
3759250 we looked at it just from our perspective within the ministry as to what our obligations were and felt that we needed to follow through on this compensation
3759251 we have dealt with all the elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
3759252 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters
3759253 im quite confident they will resolve all their outstanding matters which would result in this inclusive government and in the second instance then acting together
3759254 no deal has been signed by anyone dialogue is still continuing
3759255 the talks are adjourned not ended but i wouldnt say until when tsvangirai needs more time to consult
3759256 i wouldnt know about it we are facilitating discussions among three parties
3759257 we call upon the nation to observe three days of mourning and hold peaceful demonstrations
3759258 we are seeing qila become more comfortable around the calf and spending short periods of time with the calfs grandmother
3759259 it will be interesting to see if there is spontaneous lactation
3759260 there has been lots of contact calling from the calf
3759261 someone from our amazing top 6 is heading home this week
3759262 mitch theo and mookie you are all safe that means that earl amberly and drew you are tonights bottom 3
3759263 canada voted and the idol who received the fewest number of votes last night and is going home is amberly
3759264 alright canada youve got a top 5 and the idol mansion has become a frat house
3759265 yeah i think overall we have probably the most interesting top 5 weve ever had and probably the best musicians of any top 5 weve ever had
3759266 well its simple the same effort and dedication you put into this you take onto the next thing when you first auditioned for canadian idol you werent thinking this was my only shot in the world so you go out and do the next thing with the same effort same desires and same passion
3759267 i think one thing we havent seen yet and that is really important in the five is true spectacle weve had great singing great interpretations of songs but i dont think weve seen anybody do something completely radically visually outrageous and i think thats important
3759268 well actually our canadian tour starts in seven days starts on the 19th in st johns newfoundland and we go all across the country so check out the website
3759269 it was kind of weird at first we were a little bit nervous because we didnt know if we could do a good job of it but after earl went through we talked to the rest of the guys it was really easy they were all really nice and it just felt comfortable it was just a good time
3759270 no cambia el car cter de la pena de prisi n sino s lo extiende su duraci n

3759274 the 32 year old man was taken into police custody to assist with inquiries and the girl is being cared for at a place of safety
3759275 the primary intention of north yorkshire police throughout this difficult situation was to resolve the incident without harm to anybody involved
3759276 i am satisfied with the way we achieved our objective
3759277 north yorkshire police are conscious of the significant disruption to the people living in and around herdborough road due to the police cordon that was put in place to ensure public safety
3759278 this report has got nothing to do with the conservative party this is an independent think tank it has charitable status i think this report is complete rubbish it is barmy
3759279 it has produced some good work in the past but this is a very bad report sometimes they come up with good ideas and sometimes they come up with bad ideas this is a bad one
3759280 i think there is a resurgence going on in britains northern cities
3759281 it certainly wont become conservative party policy conservative party policy will continue the good work of regenerating cities right across england including northern cities
3759282 when i think of urban regeneration and city regeneration i think of things like the albert dock in liverpool the canal work in leeds the sage centre in gateshead
3759283 i think the idea that cities cant regenerate themselves they were built for one purpose and cant do another purpose is just nonsense
3759284 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3759285 cameron can distance himself from this all he wants but he needs to explain why his friends have no faith in the north
3759286 this is exactly the sort of vindictive anti northern thinking that led to the widespread industrial decline of swathes of the north under thatcher
3759287 apparently this is once again in vogue in notting hill
3759288 it is important to counter the claims in this report regeneration continues apace in the coastal northern town i represent which has new job opportunities new industry including a new planned shipping terminal and important increases in public spending
3759289 the reality of today is that the regeneration of cities and i can only speak for liverpool but its certainly improving by leaps and bounds
3759290 no government has done more to turn around decades of neglect and since 1997 cities like manchester liverpool and newcastle have benefited from thousands of new jobs lower crime rates and better living standards thanks to our sustained commitment to regeneration and investment in public services
3759291 its nothing but racial profiling that led to the death of that young man
3759292 as soon as they see our kids whether theyre black or latino they see criminals the police are hostile to them they arrest them and sometimes they shoot them
3759293 the police see three individuals of non white culture and they automatically get interrogated and questioned
3759294 its not surprising that people at some point might rise up and say they cannot accept it any more
3759295 were just giving a heads up to the community that we still need to be vigilant
3759296 its even more urgent given the recent rainfall to be careful in our backyards the areas in our control to try and decrease the breeding grounds
3759297 part of the big challenge we have over the next four to six months is to do this complete audit and inventory of just what is out there
3759298 the eight regional health authorities all had individual deficits and im sure there are some things upon which well save as time goes on
3759299 the fact that youve got one region buying equipment and representing four organizations makes the price a lot cheaper
3759300 and all of a sudden you want a magnetic resonance imaging system or three of them in the province of new brunswick its one tender as opposed to three different organizations at different times doing it
3759301 were buying in bulk for one organization and those savings are going to be in the multimillions of dollars
3759302 it will be a lot smarter way to do business
3759303 weve saved a couple of million dollars on the administrative consolidation but thats not going to bail the deficit out at this stage of the game
3759304 anew several times and i have grown emotionally intellectually and academically as a result
3759305 anybody who believes they have what it takes to be a police constable

3759315 aggressively courting a 25 year old woman who was as beautiful as she was rich
3759316 its not that uncommon for the spouse of a seriously ill person to commit adultery
3759317 the healthy spouse often feels guilty lonely and helpless about the illness and that combination can make a spouse more vulnerable to having an affair
3759318 edwards claimed while engaging in the affair that elizabeth was in remission
3759319 i know edwards spoke of his narcissism as a factor but far more than that had to be going on
3759320 his wife took care of him three or four times a week but she was in her 50s and was still a young person
3759321 mental health treatment is extremely important most are not in spousal support or marriage counseling
3759322 the mental health needs of a marriage arent paid attention to because the medical illness trumps everything
3759323 his wife is having cancer in this really high profile fast life
3759324 my heart went out to her and for the embarrassment she is suffering
3759325 he was at deaths door i am no angel but i didnt want to make the situation worse or add to the stress i was trying to make things easier for him
3759326 i was there every day for him and sat there thinking he would go through a big metamorphosis and turn things around
3759327 some cave in and feel victimized and others say screw it and fight and win
3759328 not only are you losing your body parts and vitality but also losing what you perceive to be your dreams your family and your social status
3759329 its a safe relationship talking to me anonymously they wonder how to deal with the mistress or with the cheating spouse
3759330 its very difficult for someone like elizabeth edwards to leave in this situation
3759331 she has a high investment in maintaining that relationship she may submerge a great deal political wives do they have an investment in the political arena as well
3759332 this is a fantastic report and it reflects the dedication and hard work of our fostering service and foster carers everyone involved deserves to be congratulated for their wonderful work to ensure that the children and young people who benefit from this service are happy healthy and safe
3759333 reflect the ethnicity and culture of all children and young people fostered
3759334 enables children and young people to feel respected and valued by the service
3759335 were here waiting for when you come out and not to do anything silly
3759336 we never thought he would end up in this situation never in this world
3759337 owing to a belief that there was a potential threat to life the firearms support unit was called to assist with the control of the incident
3759338 police negotiators are also at the scene in a bid to bring the incident to a safe conclusion
3759339 the police intention remains to resolve the incident without harm to anybody involved these efforts are still ongoing
3759340 the bank seemed to think that they could get more from the sale of the assets it looks like theyre going to sell it off piece by piece

3759564 im glad to see the state superintendent is embracing the goal of teaching algebra to all california eighth graders and moving forward to improve educational achievement in california
3759565 i look forward to working with the education community to determine the best way to implement and support californias nation leading algebra i test standard
3759566 the best way we know of to get kids ready for algebra in the eighth grade is to get them to grade level in mathematics and arithmetic in seventh grade
3759567 they shouldnt need more money to get the kids to where theyre supposed to be
3759568 were pleased to see things out on the table so that we can sit down and discuss this for the betterment of the students
3759569 its always a problem when the state shoots first and asks questions later
3759570 given that students have a constitutional right to education its always problematic when the state sets a standard but doesnt provide the resources to achieve it
3759571 a lot of the kids were capable but they werent disciplined enough to sit down and do their homework every night
3759572 at redwood we saw a lot of kids that came in and then had to repeat algebra i again in the ninth grade
3759573 we have many fine programs out there in excellent districts that are and have been doing this for years
3759574 theres a stereotype that students from east l a dont want to finish high school and it was a chance to show everyone that we do want to go to college
3759575 we need more to be done we cannot let this lack of effective implementation continue
3759576 instead of things moving forward they seemed to have moved back hes probably going to have to do the same things i did
3759577 the students were saying set higher expectations for us and ill meet them
3759578 it was a huge deal probably one of the most important policy shifts in the district
3759579 a lot of people are talking about the housing downturn but we havent seen it here
3759580 the staff is phenomenal about making the kids feel welcome and comfortable
3759581 if theres another school they would prefer and they can provide transportation they can go there

3759611 brand of race neutrality shows black politics is obsolete and should be abandoned
3759612 to the extent that african americans expect more from barack obama than they got from bill clinton they will be devastatingly disappointed
3759613 black people are not working themselves into an election year frenzy just to commit political suicide by disbanding as a bloc
3759614 for a lot of younger african americans the resistance of the civil rights generation to obamas candidacy signified the failure of their parents to come to terms at the dusk of their lives with the success of their own struggle to embrace the idea that black politics might now be disappearing into american politics in the same way that the irish and italian machines long ago joined the political mainstream
3759615 the writer must maintain the fiction of a general age chasm dividing black americans or the theory on the inevitable extinction of black politics does not work
3759616 could not come to terms at the dusk of their lives with the success of their own struggle
3759617 the generational transition that is reordering black politics didnt start this year it has been happening gradually and quietly for at least a decade as younger african americans barack obama among them have challenged their elders in traditionally black districts what this years democratic nomination fight did was to accelerate that transition
3759618 in 2002 the corporate right fielded and heavily funded three black democratic candidates for high profile offices in majority black contests
3759619 the times article is based on the same fact devoid theory of black rightward political drift and a yawning age divide
3759620 the formation of a near unanimous black bloc for obama of which he is absolutely unworthy is stunning evidence that the black imperative to solidarity is undiminished
3759621 several black operatives and politicians with whom i spoke worried eloquently that an obama presidency might actually leave black americans less well represented in washington rather than more so that in fact the end of black politics if that is what we are witnessing might also mean the precipitous decline of black influence
3759622 the argument here is that a president obama closely watched for signs of parochialism or racial resentment would have less maneuvering room to champion spending on the urban poor say or to challenge racial injustice whats more his very presence in the rose garden might undermine the already tenuous case for affirmative action in hiring and school admissions
3759623 kucinich and nader would have served the black community as a whole much more than obama but most blacks have either not heard of them or have rejected them because of media apathy toward their campaigns as if the media would cover what would good for us
3759624 it is this corporate media dominance that has blinded blacks to their true allies

3759669 fcc want to regulate web content under the fairness doctrine
3759670 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3759671 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3759672 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else

3759749 the effect of cblis compound on limb recovery in our animal model of tourniquet induced injury is encouraging and the efficacy with which it protects warrants continued investigation
3759750 these results will allow us to project the potential use of this compound for multiple applications beyond tourniquet injury from kidney and heart ischemia to reducing the rapid inflammation normally observed in transplanted organs exploring all situations with similar mechanisms of tissue injury
3759751 the fact that protectan cblb502 demonstrated results even after the removal of a tourniquet could make it particularly practical for battlefield conditions or other types of civilian emergency use since it can be applied after an injured subject is delivered to the site of treatment

3759755 the dec 2008 survey shows that federation technology adoption is growing at a strong clip having captured about 50 of the early market and the value it provides to enable access across partner organizations is driving that adoption in the marketplace
3759756 it is great to see such a positive reception for federation technology in the marketplace and we appreciate the education provided to the worlds largest users of windows technology by netpros directory experts conference
3759757 as the leading provider of technology for windows infrastructure management netpro strongly believes in research to understand the issues needs and best practices of the identity and access management community
3759758 the knowledge we have gained from this years dec survey enables us to build better products and we share it freely with the community to contribute to the productivity and effectiveness of its members
3759759 the results of the dec survey suggest that identity and access management is clearly on the radar of enterprise it practitioners
3759760 with that said growing numbers are looking to deploy or have deployed role based access control products to better manage access rights while managing user access rights across distributed resources and applications can certainly be a complex task it is a task required to enforce security and meet compliance requirements
3759761 there are many operational problem areas within the identity and access management community today from password management and compliance reporting to delegating administrative rights
3759762 not surprisingly getting better tools and automation tops dec survey respondents wish list for the second year in a row to help streamline these issues netpro offers accessmanager to help administrators meet security and compliance mandates and lower overall costs with centralized role based access management delegation and access reporting for windows resources

3759785 the storm that threatened to blow over a potentially well written script blew away to leave us to witness one of the finest moments in the history of indian cricket allegations counter allegations the show of strength unity financial muscle etc all couldnt hide the script that the game wrote for itself cricket needs to be applauded for the day it has given today its not the underdogs beating the champions nor is it the classic david v s goliath story yet one would be tempted to look at these examples to describe what transpired today in perth australia it was the case of the best team winning a good game of cricket and thankfully we didnt have to bear the extra curricular happenings on the field as the last time around i heard one of the commentators say

3759789 they need a bit of more time to reflect so they will do that
3759790 space to reflect about this matter which the other two negotiators have agreed
3759791 any so called government of national unity which did not involve mr tsvangirai would effectively be a farce and would fly in the face of any semblance of respecting the will of the zimbabwean people

3759799 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia
3759800 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more
3759801 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3759802 abkhazia and ossetia if i mention territorial integrity are to the best of my knowledge part of georgia
3759803 nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict
3759804 the most powerful influence on the arts in the west is the cinema novels plays and films are filled with references to quotations from parodies of old movies they dominate the cultural subconscious because we absorb them in our formative years as we dont absorb books for instance and we see them again on tv when we grow up the first two generations predominantly nourished on movies are now of an age when they rule the media and its already frightening to see how deeply in their behaviour as well as their work the cinema has imprinted itself upon them nobody took into account the tremendous impact that would be made by the fact that films are permanent and easily accessible from childhood onwards as the sheer number of films piles up their influence will increase until we have a civilisation entirely moulded by cinematic values and behaviour patterns

3759809 no one will say it out loud but the lack of uptake in honours maths in ireland is due to teacher performance
3759810 the teaching of maths is the single most important factor in a childs education and the fact of the matter is the education system cannot surpass beyond the quality of its teachers
3759811 talk of the maths failure rate being an international problem is a cop out
3759812 we have the potential to improve the interest in maths science and engineering but were not creative enough to take the right steps
3759813 this is a real economic issue for ireland in terms of companies that rely on students coming out of engineering and computer courses we are asleep when it comes to maths and we are just hitting the snooze button when maths points are brought up were just not getting out of bed on the issue and this could be disastrous for the economy
3759814 maths is the language of the knowledge economy we have to address teacher performance a whole series of steps are needed but it requires bravery at the department of education and science
3759815 some of these people only have to do a module as part of one year at teacher training college to be qualified to teach honours maths we have to acknowledge the fact that honours maths requires special treatment
3759816 all technology companies are finding it hard to get irish talent smes are finding it hard and they are competing against organisations like google intel and ibm if an organisation has 20 polish it engineers in a high cost location like dublin surely someone in head office is going to be asking why dont they have an office in a lower cost location like poland this is potentially a very serious issue for the economy and no one seems brave enough to take the steps that need taking
3759817 there is still resistance from young people to engineering and science training in schools and colleges and there continues to be an ongoing shying away from these so called hard subjects
3759818 it is the governments responsibility to foster the countrys economic interests and a key element of this is an education system that equips students to face the modern world and solve the challenges of today and the future
3759819 maths has been a cause for concern for some time and obviously the 12pc failure rate is disappointing the government is aware reform is needed at second level as there is not adequate understanding of mathematical concepts
3759820 we aim to ensure this changes by introducing project maths in 24 schools this september which is a new concept to bring about a cultural change in the teaching of maths

3759982 the six secrets of a lasting relationship how to fall in love again and stay there
3759983 women more often fall in love with someone else to feel adored and with a promise of protection and to ease pain

3759985 its important to distinguish between a dead marriage and a dead patch
3759986 did you love each other before and do you love each other now

3759999 the only thing i really remember was the game it was great because i got a chance to block for mike alstott that was really exciting and it was one of the greatest experiences of my life much less my career
