6450000 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6450001 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6450002 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6450003 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6450004 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6450005 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6450006 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6450007 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6450008 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6450009 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6450010 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6450011 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6450012 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6450013 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6450014 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6450015 your mom is the youngest looking 68 year old i know
6450016 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6450017 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6450018 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6450019 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6450020 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6450021 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6450022 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6450023 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6450024 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6450025 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6450026 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6450027 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6450028 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6450029 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6450030 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6450031 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6450032 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
6450033 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
6450034 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
6450035 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
6450036 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6450037 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6450038 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
6450039 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6450040 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
6450041 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
6450042 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
6450043 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
6450044 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
6450045 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6450046 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6450047 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
6450048 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
6450049 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
6450050 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
6450051 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
6450052 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
6450053 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
6450054 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
6450055 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6450056 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
6450057 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6450058 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
6450059 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6450060 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
6450061 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
6450062 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
6450063 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6450064 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6450065 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6450066 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6450067 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6450068 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6450069 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6450070 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time
6450071 our music now is not representing the times at least not socially and politically or maybe were just distracted
6450072 these musicians speak to millions of people every day so for them to use their voices to inspire people is a key part of our program
6450073 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6450074 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6450075 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6450076 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6450077 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6450078 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6450079 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6450080 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6450081 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6450082 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6450083 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6450084 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6450085 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6450086 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6450087 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6450088 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6450089 two and a half years ago you gave me romans
6450090 no chain is strong enough no choice is wrong enough no mountain high enough that he cant climb and if the son has set us free then we must be free indeed let the chains fall away starting today im finally free
6450091 it really truly is among the most beautiful places on earth
6450092 when you get down by havasu falls its as though kodak made an outdoor movie set
6450093 they have experienced some of these natural disasters and after a lot of hard work and support they are able to stabilize
6450094 the real issue is whether or not were in a period where these floods are occurring more frequently or not
6450095 one of the most beautiful magnificent places in the world and should be seen by everyone
6450096 eventually the mud will wash away the tribe will clean up whatever trash and it will be as beautiful as ever
6450097 it was one of the most invigorating and exciting times ive ever spent outdoors
6450098 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6450099 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6450100 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6450101 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

6450104 we think bkc shares offer investors an excellent opportunity to participate in the fast growing economies of asia and south america which are central to the companys expansion plans and where it has a very small presence relative to
6450105 the hedge funds are absolutely going after the best and brightest in the mutual fund industry
6450106 the guolizhuang menu is a broad introduction to the medicinal benefits of eating animal penises and testicles
6450107 my ultimate idea of success that i havent achieved yet would be for the artistic projects to sustain me financially
6450108 but if i can spend my creative energies on projects that make me happy being part of the mechanism that moves culture forward thats success
6450109 what do you see as a future imperative for risd
6450110 to connect a practiced skill set with higher level thinking
6450111 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6450112 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6450113 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6450114 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous

6450118 stupak identified goldman sachs and morgan stanley as firms whose oil trading activities warranted closer review
6450119 were not investigating goldman sachs or anybody were looking at the macro picture not the micro
6450120 all those speculators getting the blame for driving up the price these days just who are they
6450121 your pension fund manager may be using your retirement money to drive up the price of oil
6450122 what would happen if pension fund managers decided to increase their commodity investment by another 20 fold

6450125 right now wall street traders are raising gas prices with nothing more than the click of a mouse

6450128 hardly anybody had heard of him prior to his appearance before congress beginning may 20 to sing songs democrats wanted to hear
6450129 there are so many holes in this argument i scarcely know where to start
6450130 when the futures contracts for june near maturity the investment bank will sell them to a commercial user and use the money to buy july contacts
6450131 by making consumers feel the inconveniences of a dearth somewhat earlier than they might otherwise do he prevents their feeling them afterwards so severely as they certainly would do if the cheapness of price encouraged them to consume faster than suited the real scarcity of the season
6450132 it is hopeless this one is like the other one they are all the same nothing will change dont expect change
6450133 hell have to be good to israel if not he wont be re elected to a second term
6450134 will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
6450135 the arabs need america to be straight and unbiased but anyway we feel that american policy will not be changed too much
6450136 one day he is with the palestinian cause one day hes with israel we have a saying here whats better a black dog or a white dog its all the same for us nothing will change
6450137 we rooted for this and that and nothing happened its deja vu
6450138 unless the americans realize that they really have to change and become more evenhanded and apply justice in the region things will be the same
6450139 obama is excellent he is direct he is like the successor to jfk
6450140 yes they are all bad but still obama might be a little less bad
6450141 for me it doesnt matter that hes black or his name is hussein
6450142 hes an american and so i disagree with most of what he says about the arab world i mean condoleezza rice was black and poor and she still invaded iraq
6450143 i think its very impressive that someone can start very poor and reach the top like this
6450144 i have always believed that the second amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms
6450145 but i also identify with the need for crime ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common sense effective safety measures
6450146 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
6450147 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
6450148 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
6450149 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
6450150 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
6450151 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
6450152 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
6450153 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
6450154 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
6450155 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
6450156 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6450157 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves

6450160 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6450161 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6450162 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6450163 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6450164 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6450165 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6450166 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6450167 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6450168 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6450169 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6450170 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6450171 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be
6450172 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6450173 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6450174 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6450175 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6450176 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6450177 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6450178 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6450179 the challenges we face today from saving our planet to ending poverty are simply too big for government to solve alone
6450180 if you get a federal grant you cant use that grant money to proselytize to the people you help and you cant discriminate against them or against the people you hire on the basis of their religion
6450181 federal dollars that go directly to churches temples and mosques can only be used on secular programs
6450182 for those of who us who believe in protecting the integrity of our religious institutions this is a fundamental right
6450183 return the law to what it was before the current administration
6450184 any religious organization that does not want to comply with that requirement simply doesnt have to take the money
6450185 if you cant hire people within your faith community than youve lost the distinctive that is the reason why faith based programs exist in the first place
6450186 disagrees with sen obama that hiring at faith based groups should be subject to government oversight
6450187 wants a faith based program thats even better than the bush program
6450188 his plan reminds me of much that was best in both then vice president al gores and then texas gov george w bushs respective first speeches on the subject in 1999
6450189 especially in urban america all the empirical evidence continues to show that local faith based organizations can make a measurable civic difference
6450190 i am disappointed that any presidential candidate would want to continue a failed policy of the bush administration it ought to be shut down not continued
6450191 i didnt grow up in a particularly religious household but my experience in chicago showed me how faith and values could be an anchor in my life and an anchor in the community
6450192 while i could sit in church and pray all i want i wouldnt be fulfilling gods will unless i went out and did the lords work
6450193 i think it is a bold smart engaging attempt to use religious organizations to help the poor and to do for the faith community what the bush administration could not
6450194 but im concerned that his position on hiring rights will bog down this initiative just like bushs position on the other side did the same thing
6450195 my neighbour down the road has it my best friend has it and a lady in judique someone in port hawkesbury someone else in long point someone else in louisdale
6450196 these are just people ive happened to meet that have it so im sure there are a lot
6450197 and then following the levels to see that they are down where they should be
6450198 bodily fluid that she thinks is hair gel into her hair the study finds
6450199 later on we asked them to read and imagine short emotional scenarios
6450200 for instance walking along a street bumping into a reeking drunken man who then starts to retch and realizing that some of his vomit had ended up in your own mouth
6450201 our striking result is that in all three cases the same location of the anterior insula lit up
6450202 if you give them sour milk they would drink it happily and say it tastes like soda
6450203 he was only a sophomore and i was two years his elder and much wiser i was a safety and i think i scored a touchdown on a blocked punt its a neat side story to know that the two coaches battled but id love to say i intercepted him four times
6450204 ive got fond memories their quarterback at the time was greg fry who went on to ohio state he was a senior and i remember the headline in the paper and this is terrible that i remember this but it said senior greg fry wins the statistical battle but sophomore tom bolden leads his cardinals to a 28 21 victory its colerain and its st x you remember the big games
6450205 its two great coached teams two communities that are incredibly supportive its a great rivalry
6450206 its tough i cant tell you the last time that colerain has run a team on the field with this much inexperience
6450207 we may start five or six sophomores theyre going to have to grow up fast steve has lost a lot too but i dont think that will take away from the intensity or the level of play it may not be as crisp early on but both teams will be highly touted
6450208 as a new guy hes had his highs and his lows but hes had more highs than lows were hoping we can keep bringing him on hes a serious competitor and thats what i like about him he wants to do his best he needs to play within himself which is a tough thing for a young guy
6450209 i told our guys today nobody around cares how inexperienced you are
6450210 theyre not worrying about it and im not worrying about it youd better learn how to play fast you have to get it done now if theres any downside to that its that youre forcing kids to grow up fast in a huge game but would you rather be anywhere else that answer is real easy
6450211 his body brings to mind the beautiful michelangelo statue in florence

6450227 parchments and treaties are all very well but we have a history in poland of fighting alone and being left to our own devices by our allies

6450230 les voyages dans le temps sont beaucoup trop dangereux mieux vaut que je me consacre l tude de lautre grand myst re de lunivers les femmes
6450231 i learned a lot when i went to melbourne last year
6450232 it taught me a lot about myself and where i want to be as a rider
6450233 the trip was worthwhile and i think i am now a better jockey because of it
6450234 first and foremost it is the sydney spring carnival that is the immediate focus for me after all i am a sydney jockey
6450235 but the grounding i had in melbourne last spring gives me the extra confidence to go down there after our carnival and make the same impact i am making in sydney
6450236 it was hard going down to melbourne for me because i had no sydney horses to ride with them being out due to ei
6450237 but i got out and rode work at flemington and from there danny obrien supported me he put me on purrealist which was shaping as a caulfield guineas chance only for it to go amiss leading into the race
6450238 then i picked up the ride on devil moon for mark kavanagh in the turnbull stakes but on the morning of the race i woke up so sick with what was thought to be food poisoning that i was physically unable to make it to the track corey brown picked up the ride and needless to say devil moon won the turnbull which is a group 1 race that was pretty devastating for me but mark put me back on devil moon for the cox plate and to ride in that race was a highlight
6450239 the best thing about my time down there was that i came away from it having gotten to know a lot of people i didnt know before
6450240 when i first got there i couldnt get a ride at the midweeks or provincial cup days as nobody knew me and i was only getting two or three rides of a saturday it was tough going
6450241 but putting in a lot of work helped me have some success i got to know the tracks down there in the end and how to ride them i also picked up the ride on a good sprinter let go thommo and he ran in the money all four times i rode him and they were all in good races at the end of the day i know that the time in melbourne will hold me in good stead for the carnival there this year
6450242 mick channon did ask me to go back but after thinking it through i didnt feel i could really improve much on what i did last time there
6450243 i thought it would be better to establish myself as a leading rider in sydney there is plenty of depth here at the moment in the riding ranks but i think that is great for competition
6450244 from my point of view i havent been so enthusiastic and i put that down to us not having a dominant rider in sydney now before darren beadman went to hong kong he was the dominator i ran second to him in the premiership in 2004 05 and was third a few times
6450245 now with him gone things have evened up a bit rides are getting spread around us all and im happy to be associated with a lot of the top stables winning a sydney premiership is something i want to do
6450246 with racing to win it is reasonable to expect him to win the warwick stakes he is a class above them to my eye
6450247 i think he is going even better than he was last preparation and john oshea has only given him one trial this time in instead of the usual two
6450248 while he is generally better second up from a spell he is going good enough to win first up this time i know john has the hong kong mile in mind for the horse in december so he is in for a big campaign
6450249 his first up win was ultra impressive and hell be suited by the step up in distance
6450250 anthony will run him this weekend and then back him up into the golden rose next weekend the up and coming will top him off nicely for that he is a lovely horse that could be a caulfield guineas contender
6450251 this is unprecedented the level of desperation the underhandedness and ugliness that went on
6450252 the channel seven deal involved the word exclusive so when channel nine approached i said my apologies
6450253 in new york we dont think of alternative power as something that we just import from other parts of the nation
6450254 i look at the aspects of our ticket where were strongest and where were most in need of help and joe brings more to the ticket than any of the other people whose names are mentioned as finalists
6450255 with all due respect and i know the other folks in consideration theyre a wonderful group but theyre not really all that close
6450256 you guys have better things to do im not the guy
6450257 one if im president of the united states my friends if i have to follow him to the gates of hell i will get osama bin laden and bring him to justice
6450258 i will do that and i know how to do it i will get that guy
6450259 no one no one should be allowed to take thousands of innocent american lives
6450260 evil does exist and i think it has to be confronted
6450261 you know a lot of evil has been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil
6450262 if we have to get a bad rap for the way that we play and still be coming third at this stage of the season ill take the bad rap every day of the week
6450263 it doesnt worry me were not out there to please any critics were out there to please ourselves in winning games of football
6450264 and were a better chance of getting there than most other teams
6450265 we havent got the high profile superstars but thats enabled us to grow and bond we play for each other last year when we got into a tight situation and we were leading say 16 4 and the other side scored you could feel the crowd tighten up from previous experience over the years oh no here we go again the feeling slipped onto the field and i could feel the players tightening up weve worked very hard at handling adversity were a consistent football team that plays tough for each other
6450266 ricky and i identified a three year plan at the start of the season and for the next two years well be building on the changes weve made for 2009
6450267 theres still more to come if we make the top two and win the grand final there will still be a lot of progress a lot of tough decisions to be made
6450268 whether we can score enough points is another thing defensively weve got the attitude weve got a semi finals football attitude
6450269 no it doesnt we train and drill the boys in all areas of the game towards the style of attack we want which is very fluent when youre trying to transfer it to the game its a completely different environment and in a game thats very defensively orientated today its difficult i see us slowly improving
6450270 in the games they lose normally its because their completions are down they dont lose because they dont have a crack ricky does a fantastic job he did a fantastic job when he was there at the roosters
6450271 and ill do whatever i have to do to win
6450272 arsenals of nuclear chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them
6450273 if we have to use force it is because we are america we see further into the future
6450274 best recruiting sergeant that the new anti americanism could have hoped for
6450275 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6450276 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6450277 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6450278 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6450279 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6450280 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6450281 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6450282 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6450283 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6450284 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6450285 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6450286 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6450287 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6450288 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6450289 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6450290 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6450291 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6450292 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
6450293 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6450294 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6450295 when suddenly not only are you feeling more insecure with your job you cant get rising wages or rising incomes and the cost of everything from gas to food to healthcare to trying to send your children to college keeps on skyrocketing
6450296 when you find out that you lost your healthcare your pension or you never had it it turns out youre not the only one
6450297 millions of americans have been going through that same loss of security
6450298 these tend to be folks that relocate here they tend to be younger voters also folks who obviously based on their lifestyle would be open to the prescription for change sen obama is offering
6450299 barack obama can spend all the money in the world in some of these republican leaning states but he will still be the most inexperienced presidential candidate in the modern era and he will still have the most liberal record in the united states senate
6450300 he is more liberal than a lot of the state
6450301 its going to be a very difficult race for him in north carolina
6450302 he cant make any promises that are going to help us tomorrow
6450303 its going to be a long time coming out of this

6450310 designaremos autoridades especiales en esa regi n para hacer el seguimiento de este proyecto
6450311 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6450312 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6450313 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6450314 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6450315 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6450316 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6450317 its an opportunity for them to show that they know how to do it
6450318 in this regard a bad choice hurts much more than a good choice helps
6450319 i think a week from tomorrow we will all know
6450320 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6450321 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6450322 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6450323 he went into the corner of a vacant gas station and took out the side edge of the building
6450324 it traveled a little farther and just stopped dangling over the embankment
6450325 if he had gone done there there possibly couldve been more injuries
6450326 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6450327 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6450328 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6450329 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6450330 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6450331 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6450332 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6450333 there are droughts in north and south carolina parts of california most of new zealand and this idiot who firmly believes he can induce rain by prayer is wasting it by asking his lord and savior to play a political prank its not boyish humor and youre a selfish hypocrite
6450334 the democratic vice presidential prick in 2000 who now is an independent
6450335 following the lead of political families like the strogers and lipinskis illinois senate president emil jones is anointing one of his children to take over for him when he retires in january

6450344 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6450345 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6450346 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6450347 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6450348 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6450349 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6450350 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6450351 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6450352 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6450353 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time

6450356 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6450357 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6450358 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6450359 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women

6450361 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6450362 please do not get into specific policies or try to be an expert on all aspects of the campaign
6450363 if there are exceptions where campaign staff thinks your focus on a specific issue will be helpful we will let you know
6450364 i ve learned that you can run your mouth without moving your teeth
6450365 our official position at the time was that we had so much confidence in virginia that we didn t need them
6450366 i think mark warner was chosen for the same reason barack obama was chosen to deliver the keynote address in 2004
6450367 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6450368 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6450369 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6450370 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics

6450374 it is an incredible shock to us that swamiji is able to go to any temple in the world except his own this saturday is our janmashtmi observation a holiday similar in importance for hindus as christmas is for christians i feel like the joy has gone out of what is normally a wonderful and joyous occasion
6450375 how fast can one man go before you cant go faster

6450385 we feel like its just a couple days prior to christmas and weve found its been cancelled weve got to figure out how to make him more competitive in those race situations
6450386 that works out well the race was fast when he defeated kenenisa bekele at the world cup in 2006 but when the race is slow the tension is slowly building hes not as effective the qatari guy was 10 metres in front of him before he knew it
6450387 theyve run very very quick in the final stages they ran 2 24 for the last 1000 metres 1 19 for the last 600 thats the first time its been run that quick in any championship ever a gold medal has never been won in those kind of times in the latter stages of the race he wasnt going to beat those guys in that sort of race if the pace was faster he would have been ok
6450388 there will be critics but some people have no idea just because he is the only white guy to have won a world championship medal in 18 years doesnt mean hes going to get one every time
6450389 the way the sport is organised its not getting any easier they the kenyans are everywhere and they seem to be better than we are they are running for qatar bahrain america its not easy two of those guys were running for other countries and they are kenyans its very difficult theres so many of them
6450390 he didnt feel bad it was just a very tricky start to the race
6450391 he didnt know what time he had to run we prepared for four years to win this heat we werent planning on getting through the back door on times
6450392 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6450393 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county
6450394 if it was a category 1 2 or 3 hurricane making a direct hit on jacksonville youd have something
6450395 trying to make excuses or to yell about my articles
6450396 americans end up getting bad information and supporting bad decisions and strategies
6450397 i think when you get so distant from the facts as as guys like limbaugh and sean hannity do yeah i think that tends to corrupt the dialogue
6450398 defend and explain one example where i said something that was so false
6450399 youre not listening susan youve got to learn something he saddam had weapons of mass destruction he promised to disclose them and he didnt do it you would have let him go free we decided to hold him accountable
6450400 and kay had also not discovered any chemical or biological weapons
6450401 colin powell just had a great piece that he had in the paper today he was there in iraq he said things couldnt have been better
6450402 iraq has come very far but serious problems remain starting with security american commanders and troops told me of the many threats they face from leftover loyalists who want to return iraq to the dark days of saddam from criminals who were set loose on iraqi society when saddam emptied the jails and increasingly from outside terrorists who have come to iraq to open a new front in their campaign against the civilized world
6450403 and in northern iraq today this very day al qaeda is operating camps there and they are attacking the kurds in the north and this has been well documented and well chronicled now if youre going to go after al qaeda in every aspect and obviously they have the support of saddam or were not
6450404 kay also called a speech where cheney made the claim there was a link to al qaeda
6450405 after 9 11 liberal democrats at first showed little interest in the investigation of the roots of this massive intelligence failure bush and his team made it clear that determining the causes of americas security failures and finding and remedying its weak points would be central to their mission
6450406 president bush took a few minutes during his trip to europe thursday to voice his opposition to establishing a special commission to probe how the government dealt with terror warnings before sept 11
6450407 first of all this president you know and i know and everybody knows inherited a recession it was by every definition a recession
6450408 the recession officially began in 2001 months after bush was sworn in according to the universally acknowledged arbiter of such things the national bureau of economic research and president bush at other times has also said so himself
6450409 the hispanic community got to know him bush in texas they went almost overwhelming for him he more than quadrupled the hispanic vote that he got in that state
6450410 look weve had these reports very disturbing reports and i have actually spoken to people that have confirmed a lot of the reports about the trashing of the white house when the clintons left the white house pornographic materials left in the printers they cut the phone lines lewd and crude messages on phone machines stripping of anything that was not bolted down on air force one 200 000 in furniture taken out
6450411 is it you hate this president or that you hate america
6450412 governor why wouldnt anyone want to say the pledge of allegiance unless they detested their own country or were ignorant of its greatness
6450413 you could explain something about your magazine the nation lisa featherstone writing about the hate america march the anti war march that took place over the weekend
6450414 i hate america this is the extreme left there is a portion of the left not everybody whos left that does hate this country and blame this country for the ills of the world
6450415 you dont like this country do you you think this is an evil country by your description of it right here you think its a bad country
6450416 it doesnt say anywhere in the constitution this idea of the separation of church and state
6450417 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
6450418 the senators and representatives before mentioned and the members of the several state legislatures and all executive and judicial officers both of the united states and of the several states shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this constitution but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
6450419 you want to refer to some liberal activist judge thats fine but im going to go directly to the source the author of the bill of rights james madison hired the first chaplain in 1789 and i gotta tell ya somethin i think the author of the bill of rights knows more about the original intent no offense to you and your liberal atheist activism knows more about it than you do

6450426 but he senator kerry wanted to cancel every major weapons system specific votes that he would have canceled the weapons systems we now use
6450427 in 1991 kerry opposed an amendment to impose an arbitrary 2 percent cut in the military budget in 1992 he opposed an amendment to cut pentagon intelligence programs by 1 billion in 1994 he voted against a motion to cut 30 5 billion from the defense budget over the next five years and to redistribute the money to programs for education and the disabled that same year he opposed an amendment to postpone construction of a new aircraft carrier in 1996 he opposed a motion to cut six f 18 jet fighters from the budget in 1999 he voted against a motion to terminate the trident ii missile

6450443 obamas vice presidential choice will show a great deal about how he plans to run the rest of his race and how he will lead if elected
6450444 this choice is especially important since obama has this opportunity to fill a perceived weakness and experience gap with voters this worked well for george bush when he selected dick cheney
6450445 obama can make another type of choice to get elected by selecting a young vibrant running mate to emphasise change this worked for bill clinton with his selection of al gore

6450486 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6450487 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6450488 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6450489 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6450490 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6450491 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6450492 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6450493 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6450494 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6450495 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6450496 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6450497 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6450498 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6450499 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6450500 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6450501 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6450502 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6450503 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6450504 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6450505 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6450506 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6450507 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6450508 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6450509 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6450510 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6450511 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6450512 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6450513 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6450514 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6450515 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6450516 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6450517 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6450518 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people

6450545 some want a cap and trade system which is like taking three right turns instead of one left
6450546 theyll also require cost effective retrofits of our existing larger buildings
6450547 for more than a century ichthyologists have thought that pacific and atlantic goliath grouper were the same species and the argument was settled before the widespread use of genetic techniques the genetic data were the key to our finding two species one on each side of the isthmus
6450548 in light of our new findings the pacific goliath grouper should be treated with separate management and conservation strategies
6450549 reactive oxygen species lead to oxidative stress in the body which can also cause dna damage we were able to gather clear evidence of a short term increase in certain indicators for oxidative stress during the competition and have already published these results however now we were also able to demonstrate that despite this increase no notable and persistent damage was caused to the athletes dna this is a surprising result which initially appears to contradict the data gathered in similar studies
6450550 the comparable studies analysed different biomarkers for predominantly short lived dna damage our study focused primarily on damage to dna that was subsequently evident in daughter cells following cell division and could therefore be of long term detriment to the body however we can sound the all clear in this respect our study clearly shows that in this case extreme competitive sport did not result in any increase in dna damage

6450573 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
6450574 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
6450575 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
6450576 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
6450577 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
6450578 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
6450579 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
6450580 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
6450581 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
6450582 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
6450583 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
6450584 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
6450585 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
6450586 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
6450587 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
6450588 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
6450589 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
6450590 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
6450591 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
6450592 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
6450593 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
6450594 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
6450595 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
6450596 the verdict of the jury that is being selected is already written
6450597 where is my old friend and comrade in arms ah there i see him allow me i wish to shake hands with my fellow soldier who fought by my side for southern rights
6450598 if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions
6450599 we urge beneficiaries to choose wisely when selecting their drug coverage
6450600 again we emphasize that any changes to the coverage gap would need to come from congress
6450601 how much of moms fatigue do you think has to do with her diet and lack of exercise

6450604 in many ways my life has been an open book but i havent always been the one writing the story with this show however people will get to see and hear with their own eyes and ears what really goes on in my life and i think theyll come to understand me a little bit better with each episode
6450605 after watching this show people will come to realize that despite all the stories and all the rumors about me despite how well they may think they know me there is another side to dmx that they have never seen and hopefully it will make people question what they see and hear about me in the future

6450613 the standard has always recommended that wep not be used but now theyre putting in a timeline
6450614 the economy has changed dramatically and people just arent eating out as much anymore
6450615 people are cutting back everywhere and a lot of companies including caf dupri are feeling the affect for the past two months business at the caf has been down and if the business isnt making money i feel its a smart move to shut it down bottom line if it doesnt make money it doesnt make sense

6450625 nein berhaupt nicht wir wollten eigentlich von beginn an nach vorne spielen aber das ist uns berhaupt nicht gelungen wir haben uns viele fehlp sse geleistet und zudem viele chancen f r japan zugelassen deshalb habe ich reagiert und mit conny pohlers und fatmire bajramaj frische spielerinnen gebracht das ist zum gl ck aufgegangen
6450626 uns hat die qualit t im spiel nach vorn gefehlt das hat sich durch alle spiele durchgezogen da haben wir keine gute bewegung und kein gutes passspiel gezeigt da m ssen wir ansetzen
6450627 nein das kann man so nicht sagen dass renate lingor aufh rt war ja schon vorher klar andere spieler wie birgit prinz kerstin stegemann und sandra smisek haben sich noch nicht festgelegt ansonsten haben wir ja einige junge spielerinnen in unserer mannschaft jetzt werden wir erstmal alles sacken lassen und uns dann im oktober zum spiel in der em qualifikation gegen die schweiz wiedersehen

6450672 the media is making a mistake trying to narrow the issue of vp selection to pro choice or pro life
6450673 that is a vast over simplification typical of the punditry the public will fit the selection into a much broader context that is what the mccain campaign is correctly focused on how the running mate fits into the context of their campaign
6450674 one should not consider mccains potential decision to select a pro choice running mate as an effort to re brand the party the party is pro life and we generate a significant amount of enthusiasm among the rank and file based on that issue position rather mccain picking a pro choice running mate has only to do with his effort to win election not to re brand the party

6450750 se haga cuanto antes incluso avanzando el inicio del per odo de sesiones para distanciar este debate del de los presupuestos y que al consell le d tiempo a incorporar en los pr ximos presupuestos las medidas de transparencia austeridad y apoyo econ mico contra la crisis que el grupo parlamentario va a proponer
6450751 d cuenta de las medidas que anunci a principio de verano y que nunca se han visto concretadas as como de las cuentas generales de 2007 que han sacado a la luz ineficiencias y desajustes que pueden ser calificados de malversaci n de fondos p blicos por parte del consell
6450752 seguir hablando de problemas de gesti n o de desajustes contables es como querer llamar a un cr ter un agujero sin importancia y eso es lo que tiene nuestra administraci n un cr ter
6450753 nada transparente las sucesivas modificaciones presupuestarias la deuda p blica que ha alcanzado cifras jam s conocidas por ninguna administraci n los desfases econ micos entre las previsiones y la realidad los gastos en eventos cuyos beneficios se miden en valoraciones indirectas pero nunca se justifican contablemente y las inversiones a fondo perdido a fundaciones empresas p blicas y entidades varias han creado un escenario que genera mucha incertidumbre incluso entre las empresas que hasta ahora alababan la gesti n del consell por participar del negocio p blico pero que en estos momentos han dejado de ganar dinero
6450754 asumir su responsabilidad en las dificultades actuales igual que antes se apropiaba de la buena marcha de la econom a un crecimiento que como hemos visto se sosten a en la estrategia de coge el dinero y corre no importa en que direcci n pero corre
6450755 ha sostenido su credibilidad en una pol tica de propagando que por desgracia ha calado hondo en la ciudadan a pero que carece de base real y ahora lo estamos empezando a percibir
6450756 queremos que el consell explique la situaci n de la deuda p blica de toda la deuda p blica que la administraci n auton mica tiene y no s lo la oficial es decir no s lo los 13 300 millones de euros ya que nosotros tambi n creemos que son deuda p blica porque al final habr que pagar las facturas que llevan a os en cajones las deudas a empresas por obras o suministros realizados los intereses de demora que habr que pagar por esos retrasos y facturas la deuda con las universidades y los retrasos en pagar sueldos p blicos

6450771 it was purchased and brought over from rome by the first viscount astor
6450772 hed been an ambassador in rome and was a great collector the villa borghese in rome which he bought it from now has a copy
6450773 what theyre doing what theyre eating we dont rightly know although its likely theyre feeding on lichen or algae growing on the marble
6450774 but whats important is theyve also been found in two possibly three other places at cliveden so all our eggs are not in one basket from a conservation point of view

6450792 se han dado sin que los asesinos tuvieran antecedentes de malos tratos
6450793 las medidas policiales y judiciales no los pueden prever ni atender si no analizamos las condiciones en las que se producen
6450794 mucho m s compleja en su ra z de lo que sale en los medios de comunicaci n que se han de limitar a ofrecer la informaci n del suceso pero no pueden hacer un seguimiento particularizado
6450795 responsabilidad de las administraciones p blicas analizar las causas que llevan a una persona a cometer un asesinato de esas caracter sticas y tratar de prevenirlas
6450796 no justifica en ning n caso la violencia contra las mujeres pero nos permite dise ar pol ticas y establecer medidas cada vez m s precisas que atiendan casos m s concretos
6450797 hay que preguntarse por ejemplo por qu en un porcentaje importante de casos las mujeres que sufren la violencia de g nero o son asesinadas son extranjeras
6450798 seguramente la respuesta tiene que ver con el hecho de que su integraci n cultural econ mica profesional y educativa en un medio social que les permite mayor libertad genera en la pareja agresora sean inmigrantes o no un rechazo violento al nuevo papel que asumen en nuestra sociedad
6450799 ante esa realidad social la administraci n ha de actuar
6450800 pero esta es una causa m s que hay que sumar a situaciones familiares conflictivas que se ven agravadas por la crisis econ mica o situaciones de falta de integraci n de los hombres que adem s por las estad sticas se produce en dos franjas de edad muy concretas de las que tambi n debemos sacar conclusiones
6450801 no podemos quedarnos cada vez que ocurre un caso como ste en las meras condolencia a los familiares las banderas a media asta la concentraciones de repulsa y esperar el siguiente caso
6450802 s lo este a o llevamos seis y me pregunto si nos vamos aquedar a la espera de cumplir con la estad stica o la conselleria va hacer algo m s que lamentar la muerte de estas mujeres
6450803 claramente insuficientes y no podemos esperar que las medidas policiales o judiciales resuelvan por s solas este grave problema de nuestra sociedad
6450804 las medidas de prevenci n se limitan a campa as publicitarias
6450805 stas se est n convirtiendo en un elemento contraproducente que sit a a la violencia contra las mujeres como una opci n en lugar de desterrarla del imaginario de los hombres

6450891 they were promised the future of mobile phones but many owners of apples iphone 3g say the only future they have seen since its july 11th debut is a series of problems and software updates
6450892 it basically does everything i want it to do except for sometimes it doesnt it will open up give me a title page or splash card for a couple of seconds and then itll just go back to the home screen
6450893 were here in the heart of the financial district and i dont even have 3g connectivity so its kind of a bummer
6450894 its frozen quite a few times and ive only had it for two weeks its a little bit annoying
6450895 which could mean the headaches for some iphone 3g users arent going away anytime soon
6450896 its just kind of crapping out all the time before the update on monday it wasnt really getting calls very well it was dropping calls all the time then i updated on monday and now the calls function works fine but im having a lot of problems with the application and the internet browsing function so its really wonky these days its not very dependable
6450897 we have to remember that when 3g was launched in europe a couple of years ago they had very similar problems so we shouldnt blame this only on apple its a brand new network its a brand new technology gonna have a bunch of 3g phones really soon theyre rolling out their 3g network so were gonna see problems with this across the board because 3gs very new to us
6450898 thats my deadline if its not working by halloween im gonna go back to my blackberry but i think we should have some patience either that or maybe ill just write the word sucker across my forehead because i have faith in the iphone
6450899 some of the last generation nanos have been overheating and giving their owners minor burns so its not just spontaneous combustion where its going to light on fire and your hair catches on fire something like that but it will overheat from time to time and then you get some burns but this is the last generation nano the one they sold about two years ago the current generation of nanos hasnt had any problems reported
6450900 all gadgets are prone to overheating like that computers laptops things like that we should expect that pretty much all gadgets may overheat
6450901 there are things you can do you can run your battery for the full lifecycle of your gadgets battery life and never ever ever buy a counterfeit battery ever because those are prone to explode
6450902 the area is like the goose that lays the golden eggs and we want to make sure that it keeps laying those eggs
6450903 this is an opportunity to build a strong economic base for the city and for the tourist industry
6450904 its a real jewel of a place and the views of the water and back up toward the city are stunning
6450905 in the end the plan is probably a good idea

6450909 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart
6450910 directed the authorities to make efforts to expose the hidden hands behind the incident
6450911 our bombers carried out todays attack it is in reaction to military operations in swat and bajaur
6450912 similar attacks will be carried out in other cities of pakistan including lahore islamabad and rawalpindi
6450913 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge
6450914 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside
6450915 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded
6450916 it is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died rather we should thank god that such men lived
6450917 contemplate the mangled bodies of your countrymen and then say what should be the reward of such sacrifices if ye love wealth better than liberty the tranquility of servitude than the animating contest of freedom crouch down and lick the hands which feed you may your chains sit lightly upon you and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen

6450967 y el tema no es menor porque los militantes dc que quieran apoyar a frei cosa que es muy leg tima estar n respaldando a un dirigente que tiene una baja adhesi n ciudadana seg n las encuestas mientras que alvear representa los valores de la coalici n lo cual significa estar disponible para un proceso mayor como es ser candidata presidencial
6450968 hemos tratado de imponer esa propuesta al interior del partido pero no hemos sido escuchados lo mejor es que se decida al candidato de la concertaci n con esta modalidad donde participe la mayor cantidad de gente posible

6450977 disse piero calamandrei parlando agli studenti di cinisello balsamo negli anni cinquanta che ogni articolo della nostra costituzione era controfirmato dal sacrificio di migliaia di giovani i quali avevano avuto il coraggio di fare una scelta di parte come i tre partigiani di carate fucilati a pessano e ricordati in paese un paio di settimane fa con uniniziativa pubblica di grande valore

6451039 the big thing thats been happening this year is la nina which has lowered global temperatures somewhat
6451040 la nina has faded in the last couple of months and now we have neutral conditions in the pacific
6451041 the principal thing is to look at the long term trend
6451042 2008 will still be significantly above the long term average theres been a strong upward trend in the last few decades and thats the thing to focus on
6451043 the majority of irish fans maintain that boston college is not our rival and i have to agree with them boston college is called fredo by most irish fans fredo is the brother in the godfather who betrays the family much like boston college betrayed the big east for the acc conference
6451044 weve been dealing more with the high material costs due to energy prices
6451045 the supply chain folks have not seen prices this bad ever before and it was bad during the hurricanes and other times in the past
6451046 energy is probably the leading cause of some of those rising costs
6451047 this is an exciting time for the city of san antonio
6451048 we have a long history in maintaining the historic aspects of important structures while transitioning them into incredible modern living destinations we are thrilled to provide the people of san antonio with the ability to own a piece of texas history
6451049 this restored destination will probably be the coolest place to live in all of texas
6451050 the early response has been so positive and overwhelming that weve had to build a priority reservation list because of it and we havent even started sales
6451051 lone star beer is proud to be a part of this exciting time for the city of san antonio the old lone star brewery is the ancestral home of lone star and its revitalization is something were proud to be involved with
6451052 many texans have fond memories of visiting the brewery grounds with their families and were happy to know that this tradition will continue for years to come
6451053 our electricity is not fixed for four our water is not fixed for four
6451054 its a very nice political concept but its not an economically viable concept
6451055 i dont think its right for the board of regents to go back on its word
6451056 if you tell people one thing you should stick to it regardless of the circumstance
6451057 these cuts on top of that is what makes it more difficult
6451058 when they say things like that i worry that they are not making trauma a top priority
6451059 i can tell you that its going to be very difficult this session looking at a 1 6 billion deficit to follow through on that commitment
6451060 now he is driving living on his own and making his own decisions
6451061 dont let it come down to your family member before you support something this important

6451064 i dont think any local government can just suck it up
6451065 we are low hanging fruit for the governor a lot of local governments have had to make very hard decisions about services and taxes
6451066 they see their constituents every day they hear the complaints about taxes
6451067 right now we are fighting over pennies there is no more money four million dollars would be a huge hit it would immediately mean layoffs and stuff being closed
6451068 was amazed at the assertion that local governments are out of control spenders we went from 647 million to 580 million in atlantas general fund how you translate that to out of control spending id like to see
6451069 if we don get the 24 million from the state it does put us in a pinch
6451070 that tax relief grant was figured in as part of our revenue budget
6451071 would set a terrible precedent as our property owners were promised those savings
6451072 it says there is a very competitive race in georgia chambliss is in the lead thats what youd expect with an incumbent but again those numbers would be very encouraging i think to jim martin
6451073 the latest rasmussen poll confirms what we already know that georgians are looking for a senator who will make this economy work for the middle class again thats why jim is within striking distance of saxby chambliss
6451074 but when youre getting washington money it all comes down to comparisons with other races across the country for control of the senate and even though martin may be competitive here other races may look like easier democratic pickups so its a very competitive thing to get that washington money
6451075 if the citizens of our state do not rise up and let their voices be heard that they do not want a tax increase and if they dont do it before november its possible the administration will go forward with eliminating those tax grants
6451076 one of the most severe economic downturns in quite some time
6451077 were going to absorb the hit or hit the fund balance
6451078 thats probably one that to be fiscally responsible i will recommend but youre placing the burden of almost 300 on our taxpayers that we had no control over
6451079 as you know i was rebuffed greatly when i wanted to raise taxes 17 50 so to come back and say i need another 300 i just dont see that happening
6451080 i have no argument with the concept of the grants being good or bad
6451081 my argument is that you told us you were going to give us 3 1 million that we did not raise our local taxes to cover because that was a grant coming from the state
6451082 as a meeting point to many great and original minds pioneers of thought in artistic literary theatrical scientific legal and political circles providing an amicable environment for their recreational and creative pastime as well as a testing ground for the novel and controversial theories and approaches to the issues equally important to the british society and the entire mankind
6451083 british eccentricity is a reluctance to be bound by social spiritual scientific political esthetical or any other limitations and an everlasting desire to explore every manifestation of life around us for the benefit of gaining personal experience and translating it through various mediums such as art business science social events to the others to the society and in particular other individuals which are seeking new knowledge and experience and are ready to perceive it
6451084 the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money

6451086 pandora could be first major casualty of new royalty rates
6451087 with respect to myself my only concern is the small pull that i felt in the groin almost at the end of the game

6451110 testosterone might be partly responsible for shaping width to height ratio and we know that testosterone is linked to aggressive behaviour in men so there might be some kind of influence in both puberty and facial structures
6451111 we divided the width by the height and thats how we got our ratio
6451112 in the questionnaire men had a larger facial width to height ratio higher scores of trait dominance and were more reactively aggressive compared with women
6451113 individual differences in the facial width to height ratio predicted reactive aggression in men but not in women
6451114 individual differences in the facial width to height ratio were positively related to aggressive behaviour as measured by the number of penalty minutes per game obtained over a season
6451115 together these findings suggest that the sexually dimorphic facial width to height ratio may be an honest signal of propensity for aggressive behaviour

6451130 when you look at them you cant help but smile
6451131 and when i would go to m d anderson cancer center i would look around and id see fear and loneliness and discouragement in many of the faces of the women and children there
6451132 kids nowadays are so used to the high tech toys
6451133 but you get a sock monkey and its something thats nostalgic and vintage this is a toy that will never get old
6451134 if youre lonely you get a sock monkey if youre sick you get a sock monkey
6451135 it puts smiles on peoples faces who seem like they have no hope its something to hold on to
6451136 every day when i wake up if im feeling down or in pain all i have to do is think about a monkey and think about the recipient
6451137 none of us live forever and when youre diagnosed with a terminal condition you know that your life is limited we can do something with the time that youre given or not and its a true blessing for me personally knowing that im leaving this world a better place than when i came in
6451138 when i checked it out the song i genuinely couldnt believe it because it wasnt as if it was close it was basically the same riff i called my publishers to check whether they knew anything which of course they didnt and then basically left it with them i never really expected to hear any more about it and was as surprised as anyone when i heard that universal had settled with velvet revolver
6451139 there are always some crazy things i get flashed quite often luckily mostly from girls
6451140 obviously im disturbed by the fact that people were hurt and someone died
6451141 much of the coverage regarding kexins age has only mentioned allegations of fraud and the ioc has ignored thematter completely i believe that these primary documents issued by the chinese state rise to a level of evidence higher than allegation
6451142 changing to a telemedicine based health care delivery system allows us to substantially decrease out per patient overhead while simultaneously increasing the level of care each patient receives

6451147 more research is probably needed to assess the usability of the site and should be performed by people who have a basic understanding of the size and complexity of the program

6451175 at the bottom of the sea we find mountains which are about the same height as the alps
6451176 these are partially overlaid by sediments so that we have to look beneath the surface to find clues hinting at the geological history of the mendeleev ridge
6451177 id be remiss in not acknowledging that all of us at qantas are disappointed at the number of recent incidents and we do not step away from the fact that the incident on qf30 in manila was very serious
6451178 during the coalition government household net wealth tripled in 11 years a 300 per cent increase over 11 years

6451180 ive had a discussion about it with him and im reasonably confident i know but its not my place to tell you
6451181 certainly its a victory for national australia bank customers who have been doing it tough after eight interest rate rises in three years
6451182 this decision by national australia bank is a challenge for other banks to follow
6451183 if the current funding environment remains as it is and the rba cuts the likelihood is well be passing on the benefit to home borrowers
6451184 the banks cost of funds is far greater than the reserve bank cash rate however we will still pass on the full benefit of the official interest rate cut
6451185 from what i can make of it he had for 11 days no food and no shelter for three days he was on his back unable to move and being attacked by flies and mosquitoes and all sorts of nasty creatures

6451187 tail docking a dog would be illegal putting a lobster in boiling water would be illegal but it will be legal to abort a six month old child if this bill passes
6451188 from the outset i have declared that i am pro life i find it extremely difficult to support a bill that enables a woman to abort a baby up to six months gestation
6451189 it effectively is the status quo and provides accepted safeguards and i also have a very solid view that men should not be telling women what to do with their bodies
6451190 i support the original model c as proposed by the victorian law reform commission which goes further than the governments bill and puts the decision in the hands of women at any stage of the pregnancy

6451235 ik leef in een wereld met andere mensen van alle soorten rassen godsdiensten volkeren talen doorbreek de ban van een ingestelde orde dat alleen deze godsdienst goed is of die kerk is juist of dit ras is beter doorbreek dat krijg een gevoel voor de mensheid voor iedereen en dan blijf je wat je bent je mag jood blijven je mag iets anders blijven zoals iemand die kleur haren en die kleur ogen heeft maar de mens is een mens naar het beeld van god gemaakt en krijg een gevoel van verantwoordelijkheid voor de mens berhaupt waar die ook is een ding zou ik positief kunnen zeggen dat is dit dat misschien in dit tijdperk de barri res weggebroken worden dat men niet meer dat heeft wat ik dan nog voel als een soort nacht in de wereld waar men nog volkeren barri res heeft en rassen en godsdiensten en kerken en sekten maar dat dit doorbroken wordt een soort universaliteit komt over de mens en wat hij is is punt 1 hij is een mens of hij nou katholiek is of jood of wat hij is een mens zo heb je ook joden en arabieren het zijn mensen aan beide kanten dat moet men ook beginnen te beseffen dat je zegt ik moet hier kiezen ik durf het er is een grote waarheid en er is een gemaakte en de mens weet drommels goed bij zichzelf waar de echte waarheid is en wat er gemaakt is hij wil het feitelijk niet weten maar hij moet wel eens wakker geschud worden dat doen de omstandigheden wel en dan moet hij weten hoe hij kiest die verantwoordelijkheid moet hij beseffen en zich dit realiseren ik l f in een wereld niet ons vaderland gaat goed deze vlag wappert fier dat is ook een deel van het spel ik heb niets tegen een vlag maar dat symbool mag niet iets dwaas gaan worden het mag je herinneren aan je omgeving en die naaste omgeving dat zeer zeker maar je moet niet je naaste omgeving meer lief hebben dan je verdere omgeving je moet de mens lief hebben je mag jezelf natuurlijk niet negeren stel je voor dat zou toch een dwaas leven zijn je bent het centrum toch van de wereld ieder mens voor zichzelf is weer het middelpunt en hij moet natuurlijk aan zichzelf denken maar niet in de zin van ik moet carri re maken of ik moet een auto kopen of ik moet dit kopen of een reis maken maar ik moet in terreinen komen met mijn benen ik moet wakker zijn dat is n van de dingen die ik verlang w s wakker en als je gewekt bent dan zul je wel eens met veel dingen ernstig in aanraking kunnen komen

6451238 volgens de kosmologie van het zoroastrisme heeft de wijze god ahura mazda een duistere tegenstander genaamd ahriman die het kwade belichaamt zo zijn er twee koninkrijken het rijk van rechtvaardigheid en waarheid ahura mazda en het rijk van de leugen ahriman en zijn helpers er is een constante strijd tussen beide partijen gaande maar uiteindelijk zal ahura mazda ahriman verslaan

6451240 i concede with sorrow that the baseless fanaticism of our people is in part to be blamed for the awakening of arab distrust i can raise no sympathy at all for the misdirected piety which transforms a piece of a herodian wall into a national relic thereby offending the feelings of the natives

6451289 were thrilled to partner with rock the vote to make it easier than ever for youth voters and our members to register and be heard
6451290 this essential treaty has languished in limbo for more than a decade largely due to the failure of nations in not signing up to what they long ago agreed to
6451291 because most of the worlds transboundary river basins lack adequate legal protection the world needs a global framework for sustainably managing and preventing disputes over those resources and this is the only such framework available in the timescale to help us deal with a growing water crisis
6451292 now when there are increasing water shortages and water quality issues world wide and climate change will only make things worse is when we need to have an effective and widely accepted agreement of global scope covering shared freshwater resources
6451293 this is about national and global security as much as human and water security
6451294 the experts are telling us that rivalries over water will be a significant source of future conflict as indeed they already are
6451295 an essential element of the response to our current water crisis and the looming escalation of that crisis is on the shelf and ready to go all we need is for the worlds nations to match their actions on water to their rhetoric

6451299 by outsourcing the core network provision to verizon business we anticipate significant cost benefits primarily as a result of enhanced productivity and labor savings
6451300 the new network will help us save on costs and enhance productivity on a global scale our asia pacific team led by sam tan vice president asia systems amp technology and european team led by kees van duijin information communications technology manager were impressed by verizon business ability to deliver outstanding support globally without losing focus of local needs by allocating strong in country support teams the team is fully behind verizon business and together we are confident that verizon business can deliver both a fantastic managed solution and outstanding service
6451301 verizon business global network capability extensive solutions portfolio and commitment to customer service are fundamental to our overall proposition

6451303 if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions
6451304 we urge beneficiaries to choose wisely when selecting their drug coverage
6451305 again we emphasize that any changes to the coverage gap would need to come from congress
6451306 extensive contributions to contemporary architecture internationally recognized for their innovation in the global arena of design
6451307 the focus of changs work at atelier fcjz is primarily contradictory to the current overall trend of architectural design and development in china chang regards each project as an individual component within the urban fabric a microcosm that is sometimes overlooked but beautiful in that it is at harmony with its surroundings
6451308 with construction work for this local tdi production plant beginning now we are once again underlining our commitment to what is the biggest growth market in the world
6451309 this enables us to further consolidate our leading position on the world market for polyurethanes with optimized cost structures
6451310 only 38 per cent of the uks total water use comes from its own rivers lakes and groundwater reserves
6451311 the rest is taken from water bodies in many countries across the world to irrigate and process food and fibre crops that people in britain subsequently consume
6451312 whats particularly worrying is that huge amounts of these products are grown in drier areas of the world where water resources are either already stressed or very likely to become so in the near future
6451313 most people arent even aware that it takes massive amounts of water to grow the food and fibres we consume on top of what is used for drinking and washing and watering the lawn
6451314 therefore it is essential that business and government identify the areas that could potentially suffer water crises and develop solutions so the environment is not overexploited to the point that people and wildlife lose out
6451315 the private sector has a very important role to play it can engage with governments and communities along its supply chain to support better water management
6451316 in order to reduce risk businesses need to do their utmost to encourage more efficient and effective water use in water stressed areas where they operate
6451317 this is not just an issue for food and clothing companies producers and retailers insurers and investors have a vested interest in encouraging efficiency of water use and security of water supply in an ever thirstier world water is irreplaceable and climate change and population growth are only going to exacerbate the problem
6451318 theres an important role for the public here as a consumer you can ask businesses including your local supermarkets to tell you what they are doing to ensure good water management along their supply chains as a citizen you can urge your government to make good water management a priority both in this country and overseas but if we do nothing to alleviate the acute pressures on water resources at home and abroad then our inaction could have far reaching consequences for people and habitats

6451356 have a responsibility to operate their bathing areas in a reasonable manner if lifeguards are aware of a situation be it an unforeseen current making swimming unusually dangerous or a hidden problem such as a sudden drop off under water because of dredging activities they have a responsibility to warn bathers by every reasonable means at their disposal
6451357 and swimmers have responsibilities too i have seen situations in my 30 plus years in personal injury practice where bathers or their families have sued municipalities for injuries or drownings at a city beach only to discover that the injured parties ignored warnings and acted irresponsibly
6451358 they swam even though they were told swimming was prohibited after the beach closed
6451359 people have a right to expect that local municipalities will anticipate the likelihood of a strong undertow or current or any other unsafe condition at a public beach and limit or prohibit bathing in that area until conditions improve
6451360 before the city will apply appropriate standards of safety in places where large crowds of inexperienced bathers gather to play and cool off
6451361 bathers should always think safety first the law says that people are expected to act reasonably i would much rather see people disappointed but safe and alive then see someone take a foolish risk and then try to bring a lawsuit because they got injured or worse

6451370 some areas could see rainfall of as much as 30 inches
6451371 slight strengthening is still possible while the center of fay remains over water but gradual weakening is forecast after fay moves back over the florida peninsula
6451372 is expected to produce rainfall accumulations over the next 36 hours of five to 10 inches 13 to 25 centimeters
6451373 isolated storm total accumulations of near 30 inches 76 centimeters can be expected in florida

6451381 government agencies from local louisiana parishes to the white house reported that that new orleans levees
6451382 ive gotten reports this morning that there is already water coming over some of the levee systems in the lower ninth ward weve had one of our pumping stations to stop operating so we will have significant flooding it is just a matter of how much
6451383 flooding is significant throughout the region and a levee in new orleans has reportedly been breached sending 6 8 feet of water throughout the 9th ward area of the city
6451384 this is to put it mildly the big one i think
6451385 this is a category 5 hurricane very similar to hurricane andrew in the maximum intensity but theres a big big difference this hurricane is much larger than andrew ever was i also want to make absolutely clear to everyone that the greatest potential for large loss of lives is still in the coastal areas from the storm surge i dont think anyone can tell you with any confidence right now whether the levees will be topped or not but theres obviously a very very grave concern
6451386 i spoke to mike chertoff today hes the head of the department of homeland security i knew people would want me to discuss this issue immigration so we got us an airplane on a telephone on air force one so i called him i said are you working with the governor he said you bet we are
6451387 browns memo to chertoff described katrina as this near catastrophic event but otherwise lacked any urgent language
6451388 a large section of the vital 17th street canal levee where it connects to the brand new hurricane proof old hammond highway bridge gave way late monday morning in bucktown after katrinas fiercest winds were well north
6451389 this new bill i signed says if youre a senior and you like the way things are today youre in good shape dont change but by the way theres a lot of different options for you and were here to talk about what that means to our seniors

6451402 stephanie tubbs jones was one of the most compassionate most dedicated and most talented the next major city we drove through on our trip was nashville tennessee i actually lived outside of nasvhille for a brief period but i was only 3
6451403 it is with deep sadness that we inform you of the passing of congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones beloved mother to mervyn jones ii sister
6451404 were determined to do what no other city has ever attempted and that is to keep our energy usage at or near its current level even as our population grows
6451405 new york city is going to make money by being green and thats the message we want to send to the private sector as well you can have it both ways
6451406 theres a lot of logistical as well as esthetic considerations off shore wind is much more likely if there is a large ape that starts climbing the empire state building it might get in his way
6451407 it would be a thing of beauty if when lady liberty looks out on the horizon she not only welcomes new immigrants to our shores but lights their way with a torch powered by an ocean windfarm
6451408 some want a cap and trade system which is like taking three right turns instead of one left
6451409 theyll also require cost effective retrofits of our existing larger buildings
6451410 and then i was born in germany and what is this place where we live mom
6451411 yeah america you know how we got from germany to america
6451412 the deal is not done i dont want to eulogise about a player who has not signed in case it doesnt happen
6451413 but it is no secret we admire the player and wed like to tie something up
6451414 weve watched him for a while and he has got the technical ability to help our squad
6451415 its hard on players when they spend a lot of time getting fit in the summer and then pick up injuries
6451416 it surprised me in fact i think it has come as a surprise to everyone
6451417 it is not often a player leaves one big club to go to another like arsenal or liverpool it does not tend to happen
6451418 but mikael did not play much last year and i think he just wanted to go somewhere where he would so in that sense i am happy for him
6451419 he has been here a long time and he still deserves to play at the highest level
6451420 mikael has given so much to this club i am just surprised he is going to arsenal but he has made the choice
6451421 neither of us started well and we used to say we wanted to leave we can laugh about it now because we have both reached 100 games
6451422 it was a disappointing result especially after the first half when i thought we were very positive
6451423 we created quite a few chances but in the second half we just never really got started
6451424 full credit to georgia they really came after us and forced us into two sloppy mistakes we cannot afford to give away goals like that if you want to have a chance at this level
6451425 it is a timely reminder that every international game is difficult as long as everyone learns from this experience it will not have been a waste of time
6451426 hopefully now when we face azerbaijan we will know to keep our concentration high throughout the game and not turn off at vital moment
6451427 it was something of a wake up call before the first world cup game against azerbaijan next month
6451428 but friendlies are friendlies for a reason and the main business is about world cup qualifiers we want to get the best start we can in the group because if we manage that then anything is possible
6451429 there were some positives for us but there is plenty to work on i enjoyed the game and i needed it
6451430 as for me things are not going too well at palace so it was nice to get 90 minutes under my belt
6451431 i have not played much in the first three games of the season and now i am on the transfer list i need to get away soon sometimes these things happen in football and it does not work out as you would like so i am hoping for a new challenge to come along
6451432 a move has got to be right for me and my family but it comes down to me wanting to be able to play football on a regular basis that is not going to happen at palace so i need to get away as soon as possible
6451433 we need to improve when the world cup qualifiers come around and i am sure that will be the case
6451434 that was the last friendly before the qualifiers start so we have to get over this quickly and pick ourselves up because we will need to start with a bang
6451435 g round source heat pumps have the lowest life cycle costs in several cost studies that ive done of heating and air conditioning systems
6451436 for commercial buildings where you have a fairly large heating and cooling load the payback period could be two to three years
6451437 finding reliable and compliant employees to train is a bottleneck to growth drillers are overwhelmed drillers are where were really hurting
6451438 were bringing in folks who arent necessarily career hvac guys were having to train them ourselves even folks who have no skills are interested in learning because its such a growth industry
6451439 we started as many jobs by april of 2008 as we had done in all of 2007
6451440 if we stay on track were probably going to grow by about 40 percent this year
6451441 i ts not a pipe dream it can be done
6451442 our support of the aperture nature photography workshop is an example of our commitment to make simple safe and expandable storage technology available to photography enthusiasts
6451443 we are honored to work with a digital media pioneer like scott bourne to help educate photographers on the ins and outs of using drobo in their aperture workflows to protect irreplaceable image files
6451444 drobo has earned a reputation within the mac community as being the go to storage solution so partnering with data robotics on this project seems like the most natural choice for us and something we expect will make workshop participants all the more successful
6451445 this workshop will provide an opportunity for pro photographers to share techniques and best practices while experiencing the benefits of world class industry products such as drobo in a fully immersive field environment
6451446 sobriety freedom from alcohol through the teaching and practice of the twelve steps
6451447 its a farming method that is cost effective and every little bit helps
6451448 i am considerate of the environment but im doing it more for my own pocketbook it just makes economic sense
6451449 north dakota is the largest state in terms of carbon sequestration and program participation
6451450 please dont talk to me about church stuff because im on vacation
6451451 i know other clubs have the same problem but to take players away when they have only just completed pre season and played one game is very difficult to understand
6451452 if they were world cup or european championship qualifiers it would be different but to arrange friendlies at this time of year is tough to comprehend
6451453 players will be flying all over the world and playing in games which dont mean a lot it hinders our preparations because we dont know how those players are going to be until they report back
6451454 i honestly believe the countries should pay the players wages while they are away i cant see any reason why they shouldnt
6451455 other people at the club are working on that and i expect it to be done
6451456 hes a young lad who impressed dave kemp went over there a couple of weeks ago to watch the tournament that chelsea played in and the kid did really well
6451457 for centuries people appreciated only the beautiful works of art and long life of the colours but little did they realise that these works of art are also in modern language photocatalytic air purifier with nanostructured gold catalyst
6451458 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
6451459 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
6451460 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
6451461 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
6451462 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
6451463 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy
6451464 once this technology can be applied to produce specialty chemicals at ambient temperature it heralds significant changes in the economy and environmental impact of the chemical production
6451465 this collectible limited edition lomography camera has a 170 degree view that compacts everything into a distorted circular image making whatever you are shooting look extra awesome seriously take a random picture of your bedroom wall with a fisheye lens and it instantly turns into an introspective piece of art
6451466 you dont have to be a dive expert to enjoy this weekends activities
6451467 this is a great family event as well friday is family day with a special course for everyone age 10 and older
6451468 its got some very clever image analysis algorithms in it but basically its looking for shape for patterns for texture
6451469 it identifies those key points and then maps them across the photos to create the 3d model
6451470 this isnt a company thats generating stuff centrally its up to people to capture what they want to capture
6451471 were so sorry to see you go where are we going to now were not into self service we like things done right
6451472 but well figure it out i mean its not a kidney transplant
6451473 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6451474 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6451475 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6451476 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6451477 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6451478 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6451479 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6451480 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6451481 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6451482 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6451483 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6451484 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6451485 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6451486 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6451487 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6451488 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6451489 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6451490 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6451491 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6451492 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6451493 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6451494 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6451495 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6451496 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6451497 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6451498 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6451499 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6451500 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6451501 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6451502 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6451503 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6451504 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6451505 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6451506 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6451507 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6451508 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6451509 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6451510 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6451511 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6451512 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6451513 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6451514 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6451515 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6451516 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6451517 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6451518 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6451519 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6451520 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6451521 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6451522 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6451523 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6451524 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6451525 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6451526 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6451527 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6451528 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6451529 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6451530 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6451531 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6451532 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6451533 this is a sad day for all of professional football we are shocked to learn of the sudden loss of gene upshaw the nfl and the entire football world will miss him greatly
6451534 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6451535 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6451536 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6451537 he was a tough negotiator but always reasonable and respectful with the ultimate goal of growing the game
6451538 to maintain over a 3 5 gpa while playing at a very high level on the court and making the mac all tourney team as a freshman are great accomplishments i am very proud of him
6451539 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6451540 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6451541 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6451542 this is a planning took where all things are going
6451543 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6451544 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6451545 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6451546 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6451547 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6451548 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6451549 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6451550 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6451551 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6451552 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6451553 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6451554 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6451555 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6451556 his leadership qualities were so instrumental in players rights over the years both the afl and nfl have suffered a tremendous loss he was a great man all around
6451557 on behalf of the entire arena football family i want to express my most sincere condolences to genes family and the staffs of both the afl and nfl players associations
6451558 ofrece fervientes sufragios por el eterno descanso de los difuntos
6451559 asimismo ruego a vuestra eminencia que tenga la bondad de hacer llegar el sentido p same de su santidad a los familiares de los fallecidos junto con expresiones de cercan a espiritual viva solicitud y deseo de un pronto y total restablecimiento de los heridos en el lamentable percance
6451560 fui violada y qued embarazada a los 16 pero a n as amo a mi beb
6451561 im not going to say anything until you try it try it try it go on try it
6451562 it felt like the baton was in her hand obviously it wasnt i should have held onto it
6451563 if people want to assess the blame to me thats ok i mean i can take whatever it is that people are going to dish out
6451564 then i went to grab it and there was nothing its kind of the way its been happening to me this olympics
6451565 but i know its my job to get the guy the baton and i didnt do that
6451566 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6451567 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6451568 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6451569 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6451570 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6451571 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6451572 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6451573 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6451574 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6451575 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6451576 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6451577 he did well last season when he was fit and the fact he can play on the wing or upfront is a bonus
6451578 id like to see you write a follow up on who should take advantage of this credit
6451579 being that its a loan it obviously isnt going to be economical for everyone
6451580 i am not in any way struggling to pay my mortgage and i dont have credit card debt
6451581 sure i need a lawn mower and i wouldnt mind the boost in my savings since my down payment wiped me out but is this tax credit really economical if i dont really need the money for anything except immediate gratification
6451582 kobe has really enjoyed playing in the olympics with lebron
6451583 is that weve got a bunch of bored east coast sports writers who have noth
6451584 the idea is maverick is at the top gun school as an instructor and this time it is he who has to deal with a cocky new female pilot
6451585 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6451586 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6451587 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6451588 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6451589 i grew up in the days of hot rodding and fundamentally what we did was take conventional cars and added widgets to it to improve its performance
6451590 jason was a good captain for us but hes had a tough time after two operations
6451591 hes been putting pressure on himself to comeback earlier than he needed
6451592 the last thing we want is him breaking down again i think that jasons had a big three years with the world cup and captaining scotland
6451593 the internet is just a world passing around notes in a classroom
6451594 ive been advised by pistolas fc medical staff to not play for a month
6451595 which really means i hope to be back august 31st for the playoffs
6451596 i hope we can get at least 14 or 15 guys simply because we need the substitutions so that those playing on both days dont exhaust themselves on the saturday
6451597 in a response from players and fans alike pfc decided now was the time to launch an interactive forum where we can get some fun filled discussions and debates going on
6451598 weve noticed that nobody was commenting on the articles on the official website for whatever reason but a forum provides a more interactive discussion and allows the players and fans alike to start discussion it should be a great experience for all
6451599 of course our concern is for him and that he doesnt risk further injury but im sure eddy knows his body well and will know exactly how much he can give or whether or not he needs to rest speaking on behalf of the team i can say were all ecstatic to have him back
6451600 mineral water does untold environmental damage tastes exactly like tap water and costs 1000 times as much and yet sad gullible people across the world fall for the mineral water myth and think theyre buying something crucial to their health or self esteem when theyre not
6451601 oh man if i could only go to that church
6451602 el camino social est m s articulado y extendido como nunca antes en la gesti n de servicios y bienes pero con un manifiesto principio de colaboraci n y coordinaci n sin que las relaciones entre sociedades alcancen los niveles de subordinaci n o interferencia en su vida interior social para privar las competencias
6451603 the fabric of those companies was so intertwined with its political patrimony that ordinary considerations were put aside for what was or wasnt politically acceptable
6451604 as a result of that the way one would operate a business according to business standards gave way to operating a business in a way that was palatable to a political system
6451605 the high cost of living in our area makes it hard for many people to make ends meet
6451606 this is a simple way to help our friends and neighbors put food on their tables it brings us one step closer to stamping out hunger
6451607 hunger affects our most vulnerable citizens and we must come together as a community to help our neighbors
6451608 many do not realize that people are going hungry in our own backyards and we can take necessary steps to prevent this from happening
6451609 the foodbank provides vital services to thousands of people in our area who otherwise would be forced to go hungry
6451610 using our office as a drop off location provides another convenient way to assist those families in need
6451611 you could blindfold either of them drive them to the center of an unknown city and not only will they find a way back theyll find the fastest way back
6451612 these pirates are not afraid to use significant firepower in attempts to bring vessels under their control
6451613 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement

6451616 for more than a century ichthyologists have thought that pacific and atlantic goliath grouper were the same species
6451617 and the argument was settled before the widespread use of genetic techniques
6451618 in light of our new findings the pacific goliath grouper should be treated with separate management and conservation strategies

6451623 blogs independientes que realizan una labor an loga a los medios period sticos corporativos
6451624 the possibility of a block is high and id say it should be due to a content issue
6451625 weve seen the situation but cant offer any more information
6451626 the iphone is an ideal platform to help introduce the entirely new audi a4 to the public
6451627 european governments had unqualified success when adopting the gsm standard in the eighties
6451628 unfortunately that same approach will not work in the mobile tv space
6451629 mobile tv consumers have a positive attitude toward technology and they will buy advanced products and services ahead of other consumers
6451630 understanding this segment is important for companies designing and selling digital living technologies and services
6451631 ich habe journalisten nie gemocht ich habe sie alle in meinen b chern sterben lassen
6451632 in der debatte um sch rfere gesetze gegen den datenmissbrauch r gte de maizi re den internet umgang vieler b rger und lobte den umgang mit daten durch den staat
6451633 wie wir jetzt sehen sind daten beim staat allemal besser aufgehoben als bei privaten
6451634 es ist schon sehr erstaunlich dass besonders j ngere gro e angst vor berwachung durch den staat haben aber freiwillig bilder briefe und andere intime daten ins allgemein zug ngliche internet bringen
6451635 it has been confirmed that gail kim is indeed through with tna tis the season
6451636 estoy preparado para continuar desde que llegu aqu lo hice para hacer el trabajo que estoy haciendo

6451638 en el f tbol nosotros siempre queremos lo mejor ser el n mero uno lo m ximo posible
6451639 si todos los que vienen a las olimpiadas se llevasen una medalla ser a fant stico
6451640 pero en f tbol uno nunca se queda satisfecho como aficionado hay que ser el mejor
6451641 brasil fue cinco veces campeona del mundo pero como le falta ese oro ol mpico el nico trofeo futbol stico que se le ha resistido hasta la fecha qu queremos hacer se insiste e insiste con el oro y ahora parece que no hemos ganado cinco veces la copa del mundo que no se tiene una historia

6451644 el ej rcito chino dispar contra la multitud el lunes 18 de agosto en la regi n de jam en el este del t bet
6451645 140 tibetanos habr an sido asesinados pero la cifra debe ser confirmada
6451646 desde el comienzo de los motines el pasado 10 de marzo testigos fiables han podido establecer que 400 personas han sido asesinadas s lo en la regi n de lasha asesinados con balas mientras que ellos se manifestaban sin armas sus cuerpos no han sido entregados a las familias
6451647 la suerte del dalai lama me preocupa menos que la suerte de seis millones de tibetanos
6451648 hay que instaurar la autonom a del t bet dentro de la constituci n de la rep blica popular de china

6451650 el parlamento tibetano en el exilio se reunir en septiembre pero nuestro enfoque no va a cambiar el de la no violencia y el del camino intermedio
6451651 ninguna armon a ser posible en china con la pol tica de la fuerza que es todo menos una pol tica realista
6451652 la represi n que golpea al t bet y a otras regiones de china supone un atentado considerable a la respetabilidad de china
6451653 nobody really knows how far their strength will carry them but thats part of the excitement

6451655 coz dontcha know americas gonna win their first world cup well before the self devouring english
6451656 testosterone might be partly responsible for shaping width to height ratio and we know that testosterone is linked to aggressive behaviour in men so there might be some kind of influence in both puberty and facial structures
6451657 we divided the width by the height and thats how we got our ratio
6451658 in the questionnaire men had a larger facial width to height ratio higher scores of trait dominance and were more reactively aggressive compared with women
6451659 individual differences in the facial width to height ratio predicted reactive aggression in men but not in women
6451660 individual differences in the facial width to height ratio were positively related to aggressive behaviour as measured by the number of penalty minutes per game obtained over a season
6451661 together these findings suggest that the sexually dimorphic facial width to height ratio may be an honest signal of propensity for aggressive behaviour
6451662 i knew i had cerebral palsy from birth but i had always been led to believe that it was just one of those unfortunate things which could not have been avoided
6451663 it wasnt until i was in my early 20s that i started to do some investigating
6451664 ive been advised by pistolas fc medical staff to not play for a month
6451665 which really means i hope to be back august 31st for the playoffs
6451666 i hope we can get at least 14 or 15 guys simply because we need the substitutions so that those playing on both days dont exhaust themselves on the saturday
6451667 in a response from players and fans alike pfc decided now was the time to launch an interactive forum where we can get some fun filled discussions and debates going on
6451668 weve noticed that nobody was commenting on the articles on the official website for whatever reason but a forum provides a more interactive discussion and allows the players and fans alike to start discussion it should be a great experience for all
6451669 of course our concern is for him and that he doesnt risk further injury but im sure eddy knows his body well and will know exactly how much he can give or whether or not he needs to rest speaking on behalf of the team i can say were all ecstatic to have him back
6451670 estoy muy orgulloso de haber trabajado con l y de haber sido su amigo
6451671 i think its kind of dangerous to try and link it with any long range pattern at all
6451672 when those dissimilar air masses interact thats when you get storms thunderstorms lots of rain
6451673 very very unusual thats something that hasnt happened in a long long while
6451674 you cant make a connection to the cyclical variability in the weather that we are experiencing this summer to that
6451675 weather is very variable and it does you know have its extremes
6451676 you cant take an individual event and give it a tag that says global warming
6451677 lets face it there are lot of things that we dont understand about weather and climate
6451678 it depends on a lot more variables than one simple answer
6451679 where this storm did hit it hit a heck of a lot harder than hurricane bob did
6451680 this is the day that the lord has made let us rejoice and be glad in it
6451681 based on the fact he was taken into custody on aug 18th on suspicion of possessing marijuana it was decided today that wakanoho would be dismissed
6451682 the future of this coalition is linked to the restoration of judges
6451683 if the judges are not restored we will prefer to sit on opposition benches
6451684 the dead included women and children as most of the fatalities occurred due to the incidents of houses collapsing
6451685 two girls were buried alive as their mud house fell on them
6451686 a similar pressure area exists over the bay of bengal under these circumstances heavy rains are expected in next couple of days
6451687 all around the gate i saw blood and human flesh people helped the injured and took them in their cars and even on motorbikes to the hospital
6451688 seven or eight people were already dead and another 10 people were breathing their last
6451689 the future of this coalition is linked to the restoration of judges
6451690 if the judges are not restored we will prefer to sit on opposition benches
6451691 you dont want it to end this way but its all we could do
6451692 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6451693 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6451694 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6451695 to me i dont feel like hes being disrespectful if this guy has worked his tail off every day on his knees throwing up like i was in practice he deserves to dance
6451696 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens
6451697 on one hand people will understand china better with all its challenges they will remain critical on many issues that is their right on the other hand the chinese definitely have experienced that they cannot live in splendid isolation
6451698 i think they are getting there on the top and its going to be extremely difficult to change that
6451699 the world has to learn to live with a change of geopolitical nature
6451700 they have a generation that is already ok and ready for london 2012
6451701 when the ball goes too high you cant see it too easy
6451702 but its ok because if it is raining for us it is raining for them

6451791 the issue with canyon college is that theyre not accredited by an agency recognized by the u s department of education or the council for higher education accreditation or the idaho state board of education
6451792 canyon college claims that its accredited by some outfit that nobodys heard of takes peoples money and then supplies them with a transcript and diploma thats not worth the paper its written on
6451793 every state varies in terms of what degrees they accept and we always tell our students to check their states requirements
6451794 when someone isnt satisfied we have to handle it and we gave janet back the money within one business day
6451795 accreditation in the u s is not required and to become accredited by federal agencies you have to pay expensive fees charge your students more and accept federal backed student loans
6451796 we are an independent college with affordable tuition and we want to maintain that
6451797 i earned every bit of it and ive been able to use what i learned they should have told me it wouldnt be recognized
6451798 to avoid these diploma mills know that a school should be either regionally and or nationally accredited by an agency that is recognized by the u s secretary of education as a reliable authority
6451799 proper state registration and academic accreditation are the two most critical issues for any potential student to be aware of these accrediting agencies can be found on the u s department of educations web site
6451800 the only difference is that nationally accredited schools may or may not have the rigor of general education expectation because theyre based more on a specific career field or vocation
6451801 as soon as i got accepted i got a call from a counselor who walked me through the entire financial aid process and any scholarship opportunities available
6451802 this made me feel a lot more confident about enrolling in classes
6451803 they told me that since theyd maintained such low costs they couldnt offer financial aid
6451804 undergo a week long training program on how to navigate the course management systems and facilitate online communication
6451805 we provide this because faculty tends to find it very difficult to teach their first few online classes
6451806 they have to re learn all of the teaching customs and mechanisms and adapt them to the online environment which can be difficult to do
6451807 during the accrediting process were looking at how courses are developed if the curriculum fits the program thats being offered and has learning outcomes and if there is support for students at nights and on weekends
6451808 to become accredited an institution must prove its developed a true commitment to online learning
6451809 this is a success story for one person but she still cant get the time or effort back that it took to complete four years of coursework
6451810 there are many fine and reputable online schools out there

6451827 the fdic works very hard before a bank is closed all very quietly and behind the scenes to evaluate data and identify the amounts due to insured depositors
6451828 its that advance preparation followed by long hours of work after the closing that enables the fdic to provide insured depositors access to their funds so quickly
6451829 their insured funds would be preserved and they could continue banking as usual or they could open a new account elsewhere

6451848 get a media converter and run the data on fiber ootherwise the rf is going to eat you alive
6451849 if you are running equipment that requires gps sync a cap across the power might not be your friend you can put filters on both ends of the run as well as try different grounding approaches both ends bottom only etc
6451850 my advice did not include putting a capacitor on the data lines but on the poe lines since pow used 1 2 7 8 id put a small capacitor across the power leads the data to fiber converters with a seperate power feed thus protected is however a good idea
6451851 the ideal solution that works really well for me is to run one line for power and then run fiber on the power line at the radio end place a common noise suppressor filter like automotive sterieo type this will filter any rf coming in on the power line and makes the dc power nice and clean then run your data through a media converter to fiber down to the bottom also make sure your radio is in a metal nema style box so that the actual radio circuitry is rf shielded

6451860 millions of beneficiaries rely on social security benefits as their only source of income for basic needs such as housing and food
6451861 when a creditors garnishment order is enforced and these federal funds withheld the lives of a vulnerable segment of the population are placed at risk
6451862 i am a single mom of 2 kids and have a disability income my husband has left and we have a lot of debt there is a court order from a law firm that represents a creditor who has frozen my credit union account this is the only money i have for food gas and utilities
6451863 i was at one time a gainfully employed registered nurse before an injury i do hope to get back to the work force one day but right now my saving grace is that disability income
6451864 i just got back from the bank with all of my money i told the bank manager about the info you provided in the post about the law concerning my income and she immediately released my money god bless you i would have never known on my own
6451865 this advice is dead wrong take the credit and pay the money toward the mortgage
6451866 technically by the numbers people would be unambiguously better off taking the 7 500 credit and using it to immediately pay down their mortgage
6451867 but its too easy for most people to forget that they still owe that 7500 back at 500 a year and to plan accordingly they arent stupid its just that our lives are designed in a way that makes it easy to put off forget ignore distant financial pressures

6451887 i hope that our model for community based carbon offset will show that the carbon market can directly benefit local people while helping panama to remain an international leader in the global effort to reduce emissions from deforestation under the united nations framework convention for climate change
6451888 as the community replants deforested areas with native species we replant traditions vital to the conservation of our way of life
6451889 this is a very positive step toward confronting the ongoing devastation of natural resources and protecting the environment in the region
6451890 the ipeti pilot project if conducted in compliance with all of the regulations required by international carbon credit markets and local legislation will be our focus as we develop national standards and propose future projects in the context of the world banks forest carbon partnership facility pilot activities
6451891 this smithsonian contribution to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions is a direct result of catherine potvins foresight in adapting her studies of plant carbon uptake to panamas cultural and economic reality and represents a very positive step in support of our basic research on the impact of global change on tropical forests and water availability and our climate partnership with hsbc the world wildlife fund earthwatch and the climate group
6451892 todays announcement supports australias commitment at the united nations climate change conference in bali in december 2007 to support action on deforestation in developing countries as part of a global response to climate change
6451893 the asia pacific forestry skills and capacity building program will help tackle climate change by assisting countries in the region with their forest management expertise combating illegal logging and boosting the storage of carbon in their forests

6451906 a shootout may be conducted at the end of the five minute overtime period for advancement purposes in conference games or by mutual consent of both teams
6451907 the shootout has proved to be an exciting addition to hockey at a variety of levels and we are anxious to bring it into college hockey the drama it creates is very popular with fans and importantly todays players love it
6451908 at the same time the ncaa rules and ice hockey committees have allowed us to implement this tie breaker protocol so that every regular season league game will have a winner while preserving the integrity of the national rankings because ccha games decided by a shootout will still be considered ties for ncaa purposes bonus points awarded will impact the conference standings only
6451909 this is a bold decision and i think its a great one
6451910 college hockey is already one of the most exciting sports in america adding the shootout just adds to the excitement
6451911 as administrators it isnt our place to change things without adequate input for the past two years weve received feedback from all constituencies weve also been given a direction to make decisions that reward speed creativity and skill while maintaining the games safety and integrity by allowing shootouts the rules committee gave conferences a means to enhance game excitement we are always careful when making changes as there can be unintended consequences in this case the ccha council was comfortable that shootouts will have no direct impact on the rpi and also felt that shootouts are in the best interest of the game at this time
6451912 im excited about our league adopting it and its going to add a tremendous amount of excitement to the game fans will really love it and players love working on shootout moves in practice so theyre going to love doing it in a game so its a win win situation when you look at it from that perspective
6451913 shootouts are going to be great for our fans they will keep people excited and in their seats right up until the last goal or save its going to be something that they will keep talking and raving about

6451925 if military activity heats up again pipeline flows into europe could be disrupted and that would affected the united states as well
6451926 we are aware of the matter and eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding has written to eutelsat to ask it what exact is going on
6451927 weve written to them to find out whether this was just a technical problem
6451928 deprived millions of chinese viewers of the only chinese channel not linked to the communist regime
6451929 the technical explanation isnt valid there is now available space on the satellite but eutelsat hopes to sign contracts with the chinese government and so has succumbed to pressure
6451930 many elements leave one to think that the suspension of ntdtv a channel often decried by the chinese government for its programmes on the human rights situation in china is not due merely to a technical problem
6451931 i would expect that the heads of government would respond positively
6451932 there is very little that we can send into europe and this will negatively affect our balance of trade and our balance of payment

6451958 sometimes if you have missed the ryder cup you dont want to be a vice captain
6451959 everything has been agreed with abdoulaye in fact it was all agreed at the back end of last week
6451960 unfortunately the work permit situation isnt as straightforward because he hasnt played the requisite number of games for the application to go straight through
6451961 however having gone through it with abdoulaye the reason he hasnt played the games is because he has been injured
6451962 we have been in constant contact with the home office and we have got an agreement with them that providing we can prove he wasnt selected because he was injured then they will approve that work permit application
6451963 what we require from that to put it simply is a certification from the international team doctor that he was not fit or available for selection in those games then we need a statement from the international team manager confirming that had the player been fit he would have selected him
6451964 we are chasing it constantly and we have got staff here working on it right now hopefully we get it all through in time from the senegalese federation because we want him reigsted in time for saturdays game against aston villa
6451965 everything at our end has now been completed and we are just awaiting some signatures from the other parties involved
6451966 we are pressing and pressing and hopefully very imminently we will be able to make an announcement
6451967 we arent signing a lad from wolverhampton or manchester here we are taking a ghanaian from a team in moscow
6451968 there are african agents involved russian agents involved and we have got an english agent involved as well so it isnt going to be easy

6451973 in the present convention genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnic racial or religious group as such a killing members of the group b causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group c deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part d imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group e forcibly transferring children of the group to another group
6451974 convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide
6451975 adopted by resolution 260 iii a of the united nations general assembly on 9 december 1948
6451976 the fact that mr saakashvili signed a modified version of the agreement and that attempts to get a un security council resolution signed have been torpedoed all of this indicates that it is not nato countries telling mr saakashvili what he should do to meet high nato standards its mr saakashvili telling developed democracies such as nato countries what they should do to satisfy his ambitions
6451977 and what i am saying now im going to say for the first time georgia is a civilised country but in its history there were times when it had to sell its children on the istanbul markets they were then taken to egypt and it was not only boys but girls too their mothers tried to convince them how sweet their lives would be there when the russians came they banned this slavery and i cant but say this that the russians actually saved georgia why is it that today america is the only country who has influence on georgian politics do they really need to put us at war with ossetia its logically not right it was our leaders decision to do all this aggression it was exclusively the decision of the georgian state and i believe we made a mistake a very serious mistake
6451978 convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide
6451979 adopted by resolution 260 iii a of the united nations general assembly on 9 december 1948
6451980 genocide is the deliberate and systematic destruction in whole or in part
6451981 it was great for them and for shamrock rovers that they got called up for the irish under 21s and both played in the game against austria
6451982 one of the things we hadnt been able to do until this year was sign players such as simon madden who was coming home from england
6451983 right now in england the ball comes and goes there is not that much preparation in your own half not like in spain
6451984 but i debuted in a temple which is old trafford against manchester united and i did well
6451985 i remember my last year and a half of work with mallorca and im very grateful to former coaches hector cuper and gregorio manzano who thought a lot of me and helped me
6451986 im pretty much relaxed and confident because i respected all the legal steps and fifa showed me thumbs up
6451987 the life and career of motorhead frontman lemmy kilmister is being celebrated in a new documentary movie tentatively titled
6451988 the best ive been on are desert war exceed and excel shogun lodge and racing to win
6451989 they were all different types of racehorses but id have to say that racing to win probably has the edge
6451990 i rode him in an exhibition gallop a couple of weeks ago and again last saturday morning and ive been quite surprised how forward he is this preparation
6451991 it took him the whole of last preparation to get his eye in again because he had been out for such a long time but he is more forward for his comeback this time and is obviously the one to beat
6451992 im just trying to do the little things right because i think after that everything else takes care of itself
6451993 i dont think ive felt this enthusiastic about my riding for years im riding with confidence and really enjoying it
6451994 hes certainly got the breeding and i believe once he gets up to a mile 1600m then we will see the best of him
6451995 i know trainer kris lees has always had a huge opinion of her but what she achieved as a two year old was a bonus
6451996 her breeding and everything about her suggests she will be better this season maybe the 1200m is a little short of her best but her class brings her right into the race
6451997 i believe he is the best horse i amp squo ve ridden
6451998 the best i amp squo ve been on are desert war exceed and excel shogun lodge and racing to win sharks v roosters
6451999 considering the problems that have been demonstrated with these dyes along with the fact that they are easily replaced with natural colorings its sad that the fda is doing nothing to get them out of food
6452000 meanwhile doctors are prescribing powerful drugs like ritalin and adderall to undo the damage being done in part by the increasingly unnatural food supply
6452001 the food industry wont fix its american foods until the fda tells them to
6452002 unfortunately the fda asserts on the basis of its misreading of a 25 year old report that there is no evidence that dyes affect behavior if companies like mars kellogg and mcdonalds were responsible they would immediately begin switching to safe natural colorings in the united states

6452029 wie zufrieden sind sie mit dem 2 0 gegen japan war es ihr plan die japanerinnen erst m de spielen zu lassen und dann zuzuschlagen
6452030 nein berhaupt nicht wir wollten eigentlich von beginn an nach vorne spielen aber das ist uns berhaupt nicht gelungen wir haben uns viele fehlp sse geleistet und zudem viele chancen f r japan zugelassen deshalb habe ich reagiert und mit conny pohlers und fatmire bajramaj frische spielerinnen gebracht das ist zum gl ck aufgegangen
6452031 uns hat die qualit t im spiel nach vorn gefehlt das hat sich durch alle spiele durchgezogen da haben wir keine gute bewegung und kein gutes passspiel gezeigt da m ssen wir ansetzen

6452033 we talked to a lot of people and gathered a lot of input including doug williams we really believe kentucky is a place where morgan can succeed individually and compete for championships
6452034 we are excited about the opportunity to restore common sense to local government
6452035 what all of these candidates have in common is a commitment to making government work for hard working citizens not special interests
6452036 common sense for the valley exists to defend the quality of life we now enjoy in the shenandoah valley and to cultivate a better future
6452037 the valleys agriculture and history should be preserved and protected our schools should produce virtuous citizens and local government should conduct business in the open with no done deals made in back rooms
6452038 bill ney has proven his integrity and service to the community for forty years
6452039 he is the only candidate who can restore the publics confidence in the treasurers office because people already know him and trust him
6452040 any time local leaders approve development that costs taxpayers money thats a scandal
6452041 growth is supposed to generate revenue and relieve the tax burden on citizens not increase it thats just common sense

6452066 i have negotiated with the dang wangi police to stop the forum at 9 30am or else we will act
6452067 i think we are hopefully making the right steps to get back to where we were when he was coaching
6452068 i think freddy has taken stuarts coaching on board and freddy has got his own style as well
6452069 it is a bit of a contrast in styles there but certainly both of them have got the same principles and the same work ethic as well so theres a lot of similarities there
6452070 in my line of work there are more downs than ups

6452076 now we get thousands of people turning out for our fan days i went back home to scotland a few months ago to watch kilmarnock and i had people coming up to me and asking me about the mariners

6452093 its true that we need to work with the game its owners and key commercial partners to ensure players like greg inglis stay in rugby league
6452094 like everyone greg will look at his options after this contract
6452095 we are hopeful people associated with rugby league can put together a package for greg to be suitably remunerated in the game
6452096 very simply greg inglis has stipulated that he does not break contracts whether they are with his club or his manager
6452097 right now in england the ball comes and goes there is not that much preparation in your own half not like in spain

6452116 it seemed like every wednesday night our familys band was having a practice somewhere
6452117 so we thought why not branch out and play some of the bluegrass and gospel that our family was doing i like to say we started to break the rules and play bluegrass music it started to seep into our character
6452118 one of the many elements of bluegrass it is made up of so many different kinds of music
6452119 that is what is so interesting to not just us but to young people who are interested in authentic music bill monroe in the 30s brought together blues jazz gospel music irish and celtic folk and country all of that stuff was brought together in one style of music
6452120 people who have brought a certain amount of originality to the table
6452121 even though we may be entering into a musical market that is a lot of times pretty secular we want to keep the foundation in what we do
6452122 the reason we play music is we want to keep that connection with people
6452123 what better cause to support than someone who wants to use music to bring peace to the world

6452142 for more than a century ichthyologists have thought that pacific and atlantic goliath grouper were the same species and the argument was settled before the widespread use of genetic techniques the genetic data were the key to our finding two species one on each side of the isthmus
6452143 in light of our new findings the pacific goliath grouper should be treated with separate management and conservation strategies

6452146 when the stomach is empty it triggers the ghrelin hormone that notifies the brain that we are hungry when we are full a set of neurons known as pomcs kick in
6452147 however free radicals created naturally in the body attack the pomc neurons this process causes the neurons to degenerate overtime affecting our judgement as to when our hunger is satisfied

6452149 we cant go down there tail between our legs feeling sorry for ourselves
6452150 thats the point of the team weve picked this week lets go there with some confidence we are in the mix and its an exciting time of the year to be playing against collingwood
6452151 the main thing as a coaching group is to really pick a confident team thats going to walk on the ground to play collingwood knowing they are in good form
6452152 luke has been struggling a little bit with form with fosdike we may have brought him back from injury a little bit too early and i think malceski is just down on confidence at the moment
6452153 mals knee after revolutionary reconstruction surgery is feeling really good but he needs to really put in another couple of weeks of solid training its been a really big year for him and i think his confidence is suffering because of that
6452154 so weve got to come ready to play and then weve got to do things differently
6452155 if you keep doing the same things you tend to get the same result
6452156 weve got to be a little less predictable than we have been in the past

6452224 its for us it will make us laugh so we didnt censor ourselves at all
6452225 i try not to look like im judging the person im playing
6452226 whats funny about it is how he likes to talk about his emotions in front of everybody
6452227 it doesnt matter who it is and thats a very american thing i want to talk about my molestation and all of the damage and my substance abuse and we just met
6452228 that its ok within five minutes of meeting that ill tell you about my rape
6452229 i have learned to laugh at the absurdity of the ups and downs of what it means to be an actress
6452230 so i didnt really have an ego about it my career has been relatively obscure and thats why it works if id been doing movie after movie after movie the joke wouldnt have worked so there is some reality there i mean look we all are so insecure its such a tough road that at some point you just accept thats the way it is you dont take it personally anymore
6452231 shes much more spiky and mischievous and self deprecating and has a slightly more perverse sense of humor than what one would expect of the idea of elisabeth shue
6452232 she brought an oddness i didnt expect she managed to make it look really real and weirdly believable

6452236 everything has been agreed with abdoulaye in fact it was all agreed at the back end of last week
6452237 unfortunately the work permit situation isnt as straightforward because he hasnt played the requisite number of games for the application to go straight through
6452238 however having gone through it with abdoulaye the reason he hasnt played the games is because he has been injured
6452239 we have been in constant contact with the home office and we have got an agreement with them that providing we can prove he wasnt selected because he was injured then they will approve that work permit application
6452240 what we require from that to put it simply is a certification from the international team doctor that he was not fit or available for selection in those games then we need a statement from the international team manager confirming that had the player been fit he would have selected him
6452241 we are chasing it constantly and we have got staff here working on it right now hopefully we get it all through in time from the senegalese federation because we want him reigsted in time for saturdays game against aston villa
6452242 everything at our end has now been completed and we are just awaiting some signatures from the other parties involved
6452243 we are pressing and pressing and hopefully very imminently we will be able to make an announcement
6452244 we arent signing a lad from wolverhampton or manchester here we are taking a ghanaian from a team in moscow
6452245 there are african agents involved russian agents involved and we have got an english agent involved as well so it isnt going to be easy

6452268 although yeast can derive energy from a lot of different carbon sources such as fatty acids and different kinds of sugars yeast really really like glucose the sugar found in honey
6452269 thats what they will use if its there even if its there only in trace amounts
6452270 how do you get yeast to give up their habit of using only glucose no matter what else is around
6452271 yeast essentially care about glucose because they are genetically programmed that way not because there is any physiological reason they have to care about glucose
6452272 we can genetically change that program we are using genetics to modify yeast strains so that they will use other sugars just as well as glucose

6452319 this dispute was about protecting the integrity and legacy of what the doors stood for from their inception they viewed each other as equal members unlike most other rock groups their policy was to share equally all song writing credits and royalties regardless of who wrote the music or lyrics all decisions involving the group had to be unanimous especially when it came to any actions that were inconsistent with jim morrisons strong stand against the commercialism of their name unfortunately the defendants in this matter violated these fundamental principles the courts ruling rectifies these injustices it is a tribute to john densmore and the estates that they persevered though all these years at tremendous financial and emotional expense including sitting through such a long trial and jury deliberations
6452320 we are particularly gratified that the court recognized jim morrisons iconic stature as a performer songwriter and poet whose body of work continues to influence musicians and rock groups worldwide

6452334 these swimmers were truly happy for their accomplishment they should be
6452335 when we tend to think about violence in any sort of historic western boomtown whether it be cheyenne or for that matter deadwood we tend to think about rough and tumble types who were the ones to commit violence
6452336 we dont tend to think about lawyers and doctors and the general store operators but we should
6452337 violence among the lower classes tended to be really contained in the lower class itself only in the case of the vigilantes do we see sort of a wholesale crossing of class borders
6452338 the crazy thing about it the thing that stands out is that they thought they were acting in the name of order vigilantism is inherently disorderly
6452339 in particular the city ive studied in most detail is cheyenne wyoming which at one point at this time was cheyenne dakota territory cheyenne was what was known as a hell on wheels town and in the 19th century they didnt use terms like hell on wheels lightly
6452340 cheyennes reputation in the parlance of the day was that they
6452341 a number of the people they killed would not have been given death sentences for what they did
6452342 there can be no doubt that the jurisprudence of dakota as far as the wants and requirements of our magic railroad country is concerned is woefully and lamentably insufficient
6452343 it was a very uneasy fit dakota was even in the 1860s considerably more advanced than cheyenne was
6452344 dakota territory still remember hadnt experienced anything like this when deadwood came about well then we had ourselves a boomtown with a bit of disorder chaos and violence not as much as people say but when cheyenne was new this was very fresh very disturbing and both sides did what they could to pull themselves away from each other its a complicated story but a very interesting one

6452377 we hope this study will increase awareness among researchers and help raise the bar on how we use wild animals in research
6452378 while wildlife researchers have made some great strides in addressing animal welfare concerns by using minimally obtrusive capture and handling techniques we found that some commonly used procedures still have potential to cause injury change normal behavior or more generally affect health in a negative manner
6452379 this finding warrants more detailed investigation of specific and cumulative effects of other stressors that bears may be exposed to during and after capture for example sample collection marking and carrying radiotransmitters
6452380 this finding is particularly important because as body condition fades so too does an animals potential for growth reproduction and survival
6452381 not only do researchers have a role to play but so do government wildlife agencies and funding agencies in supporting research to improve capture procedures and validate alternative techniques to capture
6452382 our results are the best prediction we can make with the information available now but it will be critical to update the analysis as we learn more about the long term vaccine effects

6452384 with more than a quarter of the u s gross national product over 2 trillion sensitive to weather and climate events these events substantially impact our national health safety economy environment transportation systems and military readiness
6452385 all 50 states are impacted by these events and many of these events will be exacerbated by climate change
6452386 our concern is that our nation is not prepared for severe weather or climate change because of declining budgets and lack of attention to these threats over the past few years
6452387 we should improve our ability to respond to severe weather events and prepare for the impacts of climate change that will undoubtedly occur over the next several decades decision makers need information on how climate change will affect their local areas but we are hampered by a lack of funding observations and computing power to provide information at this local level
6452388 making our nation resilient to severe weather and climate change
6452389 given the costs of weather and climate disasters we believe these are wise and critical investments

6452403 for example seafood is one of the few wild foods still consumed by large numbers of people though we know that the mercury found in marine fish and shellfish poses a threat to humans not to mention the ecosystem itself we know very little about the physical and geochemical processes that link mercury in the atmosphere to the toxic form found in seafood

6452426 the differences between the two types of motors have both construction implications and mechanical environmental how the motorcycle is driven as well as construction and maintenance cost issues mechanically the two stroke engine is simple the piston with its alternating motion opens and closes the ports of the intake and exhaust from which the mixture of air petrol and oil and exhaust gases enters and leaves in comparison the four stroke motor is complex and heavier than its two stroke equivalent the upper part of the engine is the head which holds the intake and exhaust valves driven by camshafts engine power comes from petrol shot into the engine via injectors the lubrication of the two strokes engine crankshaft and connecting rods is entrusted to the fuel the power is normally governed by a carburettor that has a mechanical operation typically controlled by the depression created by the movement of the piston the lubrication of the various mechanisms of the four strokes is entrusted to oil and this can be collected in a reservoir built in the lower part of the engine called a sump which can either be a dry or wet sump depending on whether the oil is collected in a separate tank

6452433 we produced as much ethanol with the corn as we did with the sweet sorghum but the only advantage was that we used less fertilizer with the sweet sorghum
6452434 it may be that sweet sorghum may have a niche in some of those soils that are not so productive
6452435 the process yields about eight times more energy than it consumes so it is a much more energy efficient way to produce ethanol

6452491 do it in her memory it is the right thing to do
6452492 the results are now showing up in the polls not only are some key states like ohio breaking toward mccain but the reuters zogby poll today showed mccain opening up a 5 point national lead and stunningly voters said in that survey that he would be better handling the economy than obama that is the bread and butter issue for the democrats one they should be able to seize upon to capture seats up and down the ticket
6452493 what an amazing comment it should be a post in itself
6452494 harold ickes statement about reserving the right for challenge could have been made in light of a possible indictment of obama by usa patrick fitzgearld it would take something of this magnitude to derail dean pelosi and reid
6452495 but i gotta go and hold my nose and vote for him cuz i could never vote for a republican
6452496 to believe that he will preserve us is indeed a means of preservation god will certainly preserve us and make a way of escape for us out of the temptation should we fall we are to pray for what god has already promised our requests are to be regulated by his promises and commands faith embraces the promises and so finds relief
6452497 to leave god out and live according to the old nature
6452498 abraham believed god and it was counted to him as righteousness
6452499 that whoever believes in him may have eternal life john 3 15 esv he was telling us that the faith that saves is not a once and done action but a faith that continuously believes
6452500 blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
6452501 blessed are those who mourn for they shall be comforted
6452502 blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth
6452503 blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be satisfied
6452504 blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god
6452505 blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called sons of god
6452506 blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
6452507 blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account rejoice and be glad for your reward is great in heaven for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you
6452508 the abomination of easy believism part 2 the nature of true faith
6452509 they are regenerated and from this receive faith they believe and they repent of their sins
6452510 the redeemer will come to zion to those in jacob who repent of their sins
6452511 if you repent i will restore you that you may serve me if you utter worthy not worthless words you will be my spokesman
6452512 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit
6452513 purpose provides the pattern or plan according to which calling takes place therefore the purpose is prior to the calling and in this case of course eternally prior
6452514 broad outline of the order in the application of redemption
6452515 justified by faith from faith through faith and upon faith
6452516 impossible to avoid the conclusion that justification is upon the event of faith or the instrumentality of faith faith is presupposed in justification faith is gods appointed instrument through which he dispenses this grace
6452517 calling that is given distinct emphasis and prominence as the act of god whereby sinners are translated from darkness to light and ushered into the fellowship of christ salvation in actual possession takes its start from an efficacious summons on the part of god and that this summons since it is gods summons carries in its bosom all of the operative efficacy by which it is made effective
6452518 this is why i told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the father
6452519 the redeemer will come to zion to those in jacob who repent of their sins
6452520 god is not willing that any should perish but that all would come to repentance
6452521 usually contains his commands or precepts for our moral conduct this revealed perfect will of god is gods declared will concerning what we should do or what god commands us to do
6452522 the times of ignorance god overlooked but now he commands all people everywhere to repent
6452523 see i lay in zion a stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame
6452524 the very assertion that a christian can lose their salvation is tantamount to saying that what christ accomplished on the cross was insufficient to save completely and so you need to trust in yourself to maintain your own righteousness and this is not unlike roman catholic theology
6452525 having begun by the spirit are you now being perfected by the flesh
6452526 we must through many tribulations enter the kingdom of god
6452527 in less than half an hour you can become a child of god
6452528 do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure is there your heart will be also

6452535 grazie alla polizia locale abbiamo tolto dalla strada un criminale che poteva causare gravi pericoli alla sicurezza dei cittadini rimane inconcepibile come un personaggio con una fedina penale del genere potesse ancora girare indisturbato per milano visto che per un decennio non ha fatto altro che collezionare furti rapine e aggressioni in giro per litalia il ministro maroni ha recentemente affermato che grazie al decreto sicurezza c stata una crescita delle espulsioni effettivamente eseguite del 15 con un aumento dei rimpatri con voli charter del 57 numeri positivi ma i fatti dicono che bisogna fare di pi e lurgenza lintroduzione del reato di clandestinit i dati elaborati dalla polizia municipale dicono che a milano la parola clandestino spesso fa rima con reato nellarco di cinque mesi da gennaio a maggio di questanno i vigili hanno scoperto 382 clandestini praticamente due al giorno nello stesso periodo questo gruppo di irregolari si macchiato di altri 311 reati di varia natura di cui 201 penali e 110 in violazione al codice della strada o a leggi regionali

6452537 if president mugabe goes ahead to convene parliament appoint a new cabinet it means he is proceeding to violate the conditions of the mou which means he may have abandoned the basis for the talks but we dont know what his intentions are
6452538 a violation of the mou will have to be dealt with by the mediator
6452539 there is one stumbling issue which we have been grappling with the framework of the power and roles of the president and the new position of prime minister for the duration of the transition leading up to 2 1 2 years
6452540 president mugabe will not proceed to do anything unilaterally any steps that we take have to be by consensus

6452560 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6452561 a phrase in the three sentence draft statement that would have required both sides to renounce the use of force
6452562 despite the fact that he is adored in the west as an architect of democracy and credited with ending the cold war georgians cannot bear their president

6452564 loudly proclaiming its support for georgias territorial integrity in the battle with russia over georgias separatist enclaves
6452565 may have felt that his military after several years of u
6452566 immediately transform the conflict into a direct confrontation between a democratic david and an autocratic goliath making sure the sympathy of the western world would be mobilized for georgia
6452567 at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
6452568 its an amazing goal weve spent years and year of work sacrifice and dedication a lot of these girls weve sweat bled and cried together
6452569 weve gone through difficult times since the beginning of the olympics
6452570 we were still letting little things errors get under our skin instead of lets come together
6452571 paula weishoff all those guys i wish they could be here
6452572 i wish we could tell them this is for you guys
6452573 as i told the girls afterward other things in life will happen to them that are more tragic than this
6452574 as an athlete youre going to experience disappointments but im proud of this team and well move on
6452575 we worked really hard to get here and to not finish really hurts
6452576 im so proud of the team i love being a part of this still
6452577 i think thats something this team was prepared for everybody talks about us dominating and how well we beat teams but the way this game works the way this sport works you never know
6452578 any given day any team can beat anybody and japan ive really got to tip my hat to yukiko ueno she pitched a heck of a last two days and they beat us
6452579 you can see how were playing with our blood and tears and its more than just a game
6452580 just not smart enough to become literate or numerate in more than a rudimentary sense
6452581 its like michael said the other day debbie phelps mother wants to go to rome i want to go to rome thats why were going
6452582 the whole world watched as michael phelps took his sport to a new level and introduced a generation of fans to swimming through his extraordinary achievements
6452583 his accomplishments transcend sports and are in fact a cultural phenomenon were greatly looking forward to following the next chapter in his career
6452584 you get that kind of margin and you have to think youre getting some people watching your show who dont always watch the show
6452585 but it gets a lot of play on fox news
6452586 testosterone might be partly responsible for shaping width to height ratio and we know that testosterone is linked to aggressive behaviour in men so there might be some kind of influence in both puberty and facial structures
6452587 we divided the width by the height and thats how we got our ratio
6452588 in the questionnaire men had a larger facial width to height ratio higher scores of trait dominance and were more reactively aggressive compared with women
6452589 individual differences in the facial width to height ratio predicted reactive aggression in men but not in women
6452590 individual differences in the facial width to height ratio were positively related to aggressive behaviour as measured by the number of penalty minutes per game obtained over a season
6452591 together these findings suggest that the sexually dimorphic facial width to height ratio may be an honest signal of propensity for aggressive behaviour

6452602 it was difficult for him to accept when i said to him you cant do this youve got to adapt because of his conviction he was a lobbyist and he had to do his job as a lobbyist and i had to do my job as a parliamentarian i wasnt propagandising i was trying to get legislation he would come into difficulties if he was found to be supporting my compromises as he saw it but i knew that you had to give them carrots in order to be able to get the result you wanted and that the thing to do was take it easy bit by bit

6452605 we have been caught by surprise as to how quickly our situation has become public
6452606 it is with regret that i confirm todays media reports are correct and that liz and i have decided to separate
6452607 given the personal nature of the matter i ask that you please respect our privacy as we attempt to deal with this sensitive situation
6452608 the guy who stabbed me he had me from behind
6452609 i thought i was going to die i told my partner get the phone i want to call the kids i was in intensive care for a week it is a miracle that i survived
6452610 these two guys were sitting there with their reverse lights on they were ready to come out
6452611 the thing that kept me strong was that i had unfinished business with my children
6452612 all i saw was blood everywhere i was so shocked and scared i didnt know what to do
6452613 the guy who stabbed me he had me from behind
6452614 his family is absolutely devastated especially when khaled had started to pull his life together
6452615 they totally understand it was a robbery they totally understand what their son was involved in
6452616 he warned young people not to go down the wrong path
6452617 if they do they would have effectively ended up killing their own parents with their own hand because their loved ones go through all this pain and grief youre killing your own mother youre killing your own father before you end up killing yourself
6452618 i think the guards did exactly what they were trained to do
6452619 i think it was a life threatening situation and they were in imminent danger
6452620 his family is absolutely devastated especially when khaled had started to pull his life together
6452621 when you have a long shift at work you often get home really tired and it is hard to study there are times when work hurts my marks
6452622 it can be very hard because it is a lot of hours i dont get to sleep until late and i often get to school late in the morning
6452623 at the moment i have two half days off school but if i could make it one free day it would really help me balance things
6452624 he was listless was having trouble breathing was not really staying afloat the way a whale should
6452625 we had hoped wed have more time to look at arrangements but weve had to make a very very difficult decision in the best and most humane interest of the animal to put it down
6452626 families have been doing it tough after eight rate rises in three years on the back of record inflation
6452627 thats why this is such an important decision and why i have been so vocal about this issue in recent months
6452628 when i was getting my hair cut a barber turned around and he said to me do you think theres any chance well get a rate cut
6452629 and theres no question that its on the top of a lot of peoples minds as to when they can get some relief
6452630 and the reserve bank i feel is sending a signal out that its intending on doing so and nothing gives me greater pleasure for us to follow suit
6452631 i wonder if that eagle eye is actually doing anything

6452636 i have neither heard nor read any expression by either collins or allen during this controversy about their desire to see the conversion of biw from a war industry to a peace industry
6452637 some of the confusion over what ships are needed suggests that something is totally out of control
6452638 a job welding a fitting on a generator or fabricating a blade for a windmill designed to produce wind power is still a job and one which is more rewarding for the future of this country
6452639 the continued production of machines of war has a limited future in terms of enhancing the quality of life for the average american citizen or the average citizen of maine empires built on military strength nations which rely on the military industrial complex for producing their gdp have a long history of failure
6452640 the united states is clearly going in this direction and it is essential to reverse course for this nations survival
6452641 plans for wind farms in aroostook county and on the offshore islands are very much in the news this week
6452642 and the machinery to produce this energy in maine hundreds of windmills planned for maine alone will be imported from europe
6452643 our current maine federal officeholders should be advocating for peace time conversion at biw biw has the skilled work force and the tools for a smooth conversion to producing windmills not machines of war to producing vehicles for mass transportation not weapons for mass destruction

6452646 if australia were to follow the racps recommendation to include adhd as a disability category eligible for additional support funding special education budgets for all australian educational jurisdictions would skyrocket
6452647 schools and educational systems will not be able to cope with the demand and as such each additional supported child will receive less
6452648 in the end children with significant disabilities cerebral palsy autism intellectual impairment will not receive the support they require and the segregation of students with high support needs will continue to increase

6452701 this work will make it possible for a wide variety of devices to find each other and interoperate using web services techniques

6452714 another movie he directed brainstorm was originally designed to highlight a projection technology he was promoting the movie was about recording experiences in the film the recorded experiences were going to be played at 48 frames per second as opposed to the standard 24 frames per second his feeling was that audiences had gotten used to the look of standard film people were subliminally aware of the 24 frame per second flicker by projecting the film at twice the standard rate the flicker was harder to perceive and the film would be given that much more immediacy however it was impossible to convince the theater owners to install the special projectors to show the recorded experience sequences the movie was released as a conventional film fortunately the story stood up well on its own partly correct showscan runs at 60fps when he was doing test work for 2001 i believe it was on the spacewalk footage but its been years since i read up on the process and things have blurred for me he accidentally ran a sequence at 60fps and the uniform reaction in the booth was shock that hed gotten a 3d effect with a conventional camera he did dream up brainstorm to use the process but the studio hed been working with didnt want to install the only projector on the market that would run 60fps for an extended period without breaking for just one film and he ended up taking the story idea with him to mgm as i remember it he had to do a sizable payout to get it from his previous studio even then mgm wouldnt go for it compare and contrast with the ua chain which installed a highly sophisticated 3d system in a number of their theaters including seattle and ended up offering a couple of million dollars as a bounty to get someone anyone to shoot a feature using it there were several showscan shorts shot the one at expo 86 the one on magic tricks starring christopher lee and it looked like hed finally get them in widespread distribution when he signed a deal with a major restaurant chain to add a showscan theater to each of their restaurants but the chain was chuck e cheese and the deal was about two months before they imploded of all the reviews i read about the process the one that stuck with me was the one in cinefantastique that said makeup technology was going to have to improve greatly if the process was going to catch on you could apparently see every pore on christopher lees face
6452715 each videotape is unique and any given vcr may or may not be best depending on the videotape in question

6452725 a gentle loving inner peace and silence is here and now in this moment it is right here within you and all around you a stillness a seeming nothingness out of which everything arises exists and eventually returns
6452726 i only went out for a walk and finally concluded to stay out till sundown for going out i found was really going in
6452727 the more you have sex the more likely youll be to continue to produce testosterone one of the primary hormones responsible for sexual desire

6452736 he just started swimming freestyle and backstroke and only stopped to slide belly first onto the tanks platform so he could be fed dozens of fried egg sandwiches

6452738 those seated in the first 14 rows should be prepared to get soaked
6452739 also michaels two friends olympic swimmers ryan lochte and jason lezak will open the show with their humorous beach ball antics
6452740 i have never seen a stranger yet more majestic looking creature
6452741 last year we went to seaworld san diego and saw michaels female counterpart michelle and even though the show was a little funnier than this one nothing compares to watching michael almost hover over the water after launching his trainer into the air
6452742 i liked it when he played dead and floated in the water
6452743 you can write what you see thats the best way i can tell you
6452744 in many ways my life has been an open book
6452745 but i havent always been the one writing the story with this show however people will get to see and hear with their own eyes and ears what really goes on in my life and i think theyll come to understand me a little bit better with each episode
6452746 after watching this show people will come to realize that despite all the stories and all the rumors about me despite how well they may think they know me there is another side to dmx that they have never seen and hopefully it will make people question what they see and hear about me in the future
6452747 you have to search for them and completely eradicate them only then can peace come
6452748 we all had our own character and style one brother was into pet shop boys and depeche mode and another was into the revolting cocks and ministry

6452751 het zal zeker wel enigszins waar zijn maar het heeft ook te maken met de manier waarop je er naar kijkt het holland heineken house is misschien wel een feesttent geworden maar het is er wel n met hoog niveau en waar veel landen met respect naar kijken
6452752 dan vergeet je wat er overdag gebeurt in het hhh zijn namelijk twee grote zalen e n ruimte betreft de entree twee restaurants hospitality lounges en de ruimtes van atp de andere ruimte is een langwerpige ruime zaal met een groot podium waar overdag via beeldschermen wedstrijden worden gekeken s avonds is deze zaal het toneel van een groot feest met huldigingen en inderdaad veel drank maar ook met internationaal aanzien

6452757 we are the first to show that you can do this to a single electron in a self assembled quantum dot
6452758 if youre going to do quantum computing you have to be able to work with one electron at a time
6452759 this dark state is a place where information can be stored without any error
6452760 the national security agency has said that based on our present technology we have about a 20 year window of security
6452761 that means if we sent up a satellite today it would take somebody about 20 years to crack the code quantum computers will let you develop a code that would be impossible to crack with a conventional computer
6452762 coherent population trapping of an electron spin in a single negatively charged quantum dot
6452763 our society is run by insane people for insane objectives i think were being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and i think im liable to be put away as insane for expressing that thats whats insane about it
6452764 those 80 85 who did not fire did not run or hide in many cases they were willing to risk great danger to rescue comrades get ammunition or run messages but they simply would not fire their weapons at the enemy even when faced with repeated waves of banzai charges
6452765 if the people knew what we had done they would chase us down the street and lynch us

6452775 okay im waiting on servall to come spray i might want to put on pants and im also blogging with no pants
6452776 well that is interesting to read at dark thirty a m
6452777 whats even more interesting is that i have on christmas underwear in august or that i own christmas underwear
6452778 ok something tells me that the birth of jesus christ is corrupted the moment his bday is on things placed anywhere near the genitals
6452779 its not like theres a picture of a manger on my crotch or a picture of wise men walking down the crack of my ass
6452780 still demonstrative of the green corrupting the sanctity of jcs holy beginning
6452781 even jesus cant escape the corrupt minds of novelty item executives its like a 2008 version of judas but im innocent because my mom bought them for me
6452782 ok either way you are pimping out xmas like the capitalist pigs who turned xmas into a whore each and everytime you spread the joy of the season with your crotch
6452783 im not pimping out christmas because no one sees my underwear except jeremy besides what better way to promote jesus than on a vagina
6452784 except youre not a virgin and not worthy of carrying jesus anywhere near your vagina
6452785 i am filled with christ love people pay attention to vaginas its even a debate now whether jesus paid attention to vagina jesus dont like hypocrits
6452786 lips are devil red and skins the color of mocha
6452787 everyone has a true understanding that its not what anyone wanted its just the economic climate
6452788 until the ink is dry on the paper anything can go wrong

6452790 kevin had gone to bed and i was just finishing cleaning up in the kitchen
6452791 i looked up and mike was sitting at the breakfast bar thats between the kitchen and family room he didnt say anything but i got the distinct impression that he wanted to talk to his brother so i went and got kevin when we got back he was gone kevin spent the night on the couch in the morning he said he never saw anything but could feel mikes presence around him
6452792 she said that mikes murder was planned but was not supposed to happen that night
6452793 but something upset the apple cart and they had to do it then and there
6452794 she said it was planned at an expensive type cabin way up in the mountains near a lake that the plotters went much further up in oregon government than anybody thought
6452795 it wasnt uncommon for people who have violent deaths to attempt to make contact with the living
6452796 but two seconds later i was mike suddenly i was there in the parking lot where he was attacked i dont remember a lot but i remember a great deal of pain there were three people there all males i think i remember the knife appearing as being surprise the most pain was in my chest but my shoulder and head hurt too then it went dark and the last thing i remember was the sensation of being dragged
6452797 as i was coming out of it i became aware of kevin yelling
6452798 i had been pacing the floor wringing my hands crying it was a hellacious day i was in the kitchen getting a glass of milk when i turned around there was mike three feet away from me in a brightly lit kitchen he was dressed in casual clothes and looked like i could reach out an touch him

6452806 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
6452807 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
6452808 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
6452809 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
6452810 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6452811 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
6452812 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
6452813 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
6452814 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
6452815 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
6452816 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
6452817 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6452818 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6452819 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6452820 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6452821 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6452822 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6452823 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6452824 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6452825 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6452826 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
6452827 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
6452828 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
6452829 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
6452830 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6452831 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6452832 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6452833 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6452834 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
6452835 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
6452836 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6452837 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
6452838 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
6452839 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
6452840 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6452841 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
6452842 to our knowledge this is the first instance in which microcontact printing has been used to fabricate and position microbattery electrodes and the first use of virus based assembly in such a process
6452843 does not involve any expensive equipment and is done at room temperature
6452844 then we turn the stamp over and transfer the electrolyte and anode to a platinum structure
6452845 were also interested in integrating the batteries with biological organisms
6452846 rhodium is used most often for this kind of catalyst and it costs around 9 000 an ounce
6452847 there are many practical issues that need to be resolved before we can use hydrogen as fuel how to make it how to transport it how to create the infrastructure for people to fill their cars with it
6452848 our research lends itself to whats called a distributed production strategy instead of making hydrogen from biofuel at a centralized facility and transporting it to gas stations we could use our catalyst inside reactors that are actually located at the gas stations so we wouldnt have to transport or store the hydrogen we could store the biofuel and make hydrogen on the spot
6452849 precious metals have high catalytic activity and in most cases high stability but theyre also very expensive so our goal from the outset was to come up with a precious metal free catalyst one that was based on metals that are readily available and inexpensive but still highly active and stable so that sets us apart from most of the other groups in the world
6452850 whenever a process works at a lower temperature that brings energy savings and cost savings
6452851 also if the catalyst is highly active and can achieve high hydrogen yields we dont need as much of it that will bring down the size of the reactor and its cost

6452886 researchers analyzed data from nearly 80 000 military personnel including more than 11 000 who were sent to iraq and afghanistan they looked at whether deployment and combat exposure were linked with new alcohol problems such as binge drinking and found that more than 600 combat troops who reported no binge drinking at the start of the study developed the problem after deployment and combat exposure
6452887 new patterns of regular heavy drinking and alcohol problems such as missing work because of drinking occurred more often in national guard and reserve troops who experienced combat their risk of developing new drinking problems compared to guardsmen and reservists who werent deployed was about 60 percent higher
6452888 more than half of veterans who took their own lives after returning from iraq or afghanistan were members of the national guard or reserves
6452889 iraq was the most common deployment location for both suicides and attempts
6452890 active duty service members have 1 2 million dependents aged 23 years and younger many of those serving have had at least 2 to 4 deployments some lasting 18 months about 44 percent of active duty troops have children nearly two fifths of whom are aged 5 years or younger
6452891 have 660 000 children and adolescents younger than 22 years and their families face similar strains from deployment about 38 percent of the selected reserve force have children one fifth of whom are aged 5 years or younger
6452892 we worry about the corrosive impact of stress with multiple deployments as soldiers are redeployed spouses at home may develop increased anxiety and potentially pay less attention to childrens needs
6452893 researchers found the rate of child maltreatment through neglect or physical emotional or sexual abuse in families of us army enlisted soldiers was 42 percent higher during combat deployment than in nondeployment
6452894 the rate of child maltreatment by female civilian spouses was significantly elevated
6452895 re screening of 88 235 us soldiers several months after their return from iraq identified a large cohort whose mental health problems were missed on initial screening
6452896 clinicians identified 20 3 percent of active and 42 4 percent of reserve component soldiers who needed mental health treatment at the second screening concerns about interpersonal conflict increased 4 fold
6452897 there is no such thing as an injured service member
6452898 marines were at increased odds of continue go binge drink after deployment as well as to experience new onset alcohol related problems

6452917 theres currently a lot of uncertainty in the city so what better way to escape the concrete jungle than by slipping on a pair of grass flip flops and walking around in your own mobile meadow we cheer people up every day with our one of a kind doughnuts but hopefully by providing them with their own part of park life too well be able to bring a sense of natural calm to stressed out workers

6452922 my husband said he was going to see his family
6452923 and the russians said again are you going to the american side
6452924 so the russians view you as the american side even though there are no americans here

6452932 when she died a co worker gave me a copy of an obituary she wrote for her father as a kind of writing guide what struck me was how my mother was none of the things i was reading she was never there for us she was never good and she left no legacy so how could i say any of the usual things about her

6452937 the future of this coalition is linked to the restoration of judges

6452945 quite simply rep cohen will have to accept what the rest of the country will have to accept there has been an unofficial congressional white caucus for over 200 years and now its our turn to say who can join the club he does not and cannot meet the membership criteria unless he can change his skin color primarily we are concerned with the needs and concerns of the black population and we will not allow white america to infringe on those objectives
6452946 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6452947 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6452948 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6452949 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6452950 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6452951 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6452952 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6452953 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6452954 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6452955 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6452956 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
6452957 and as we said from the beginning there is no hidden agenda here
6452958 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion

6453050 testosterone might be partly responsible for shaping width to height ratio and we know that testosterone is linked to aggressive behaviour in men so there might be some kind of influence in both puberty and facial structures
6453051 we divided the width by the height and thats how we got our ratio
6453052 in the questionnaire men had a larger facial width to height ratio higher scores of trait dominance and were more reactively aggressive compared with women
6453053 individual differences in the facial width to height ratio predicted reactive aggression in men but not in women
6453054 individual differences in the facial width to height ratio were positively related to aggressive behaviour as measured by the number of penalty minutes per game obtained over a season
6453055 together these findings suggest that the sexually dimorphic facial width to height ratio may be an honest signal of propensity for aggressive behaviour
6453056 to combat dismal click through rates of traditional social network advertisements these features emulate widgets and encourage users to increase member adoption viral growth and brand interaction

6453061 there had been no risk assessment on the site and no english speaking workers
6453062 this was not a case of failing to heed warning nor flouting health and safety for profiteering there were safety hats boots and clothing on site and the man who died was a sub contractor
6453063 they were probably illegal immigrants grateful for work with no questions asked

6453102 she is a great match for this district because of her interests because of her energy because of her consensus building
6453103 her personality is going to be just a great fit
6453104 we feel that we have a vast potential to save in utilities
6453105 we have got to do something dramatic to save that amount of money
6453106 all of these things that you do in your own house we want our own staff to do
6453107 it could be theyre concerned about the change in focus or direction
6453108 it could be theyre concerned about the relationship and subordination to the mayors control it could be they prefer to be in a different environment
6453109 they allowed the principals and assistant principals to stay if they wished
6453110 everyone wants to know what its going to look like
6453111 its an amazing opportunity for our students and our community to hear first hand accounts of whats going on in the republic of georgia
6453112 were very fortunate that our guests were able to make it out of georgia during this time of war knowing this group like i do i know their comments will be revealing and animated
6453113 her successor will have a lot of challenges but she has created a real infrastructure
6453114 the organization itself is a support for schools this is what charter support organizations should do
6453115 its such a really amazing opportunity to create a vision for kids globally
6453116 i have fewer concerns than i did five years ago
6453117 its not a pilot anymore its a part of mainstream education that deserves support and recognition
6453118 she has forced the system to be more competitive instead of griping and carping
6453119 from day one in the lausd boardroom caprice has understood the need to reinvigorate our public school system with small independent community schools
6453120 she leaves a legacy as one of the pioneers of an independent school movement that will fundamentally transform this district
6453121 i think the critical perspective caprice brings to the table is not just leveraging change for charters but system change within the district

6453123 i didnt know it was this bad im sorry it is
6453124 i think we have some gaps not to place the blame on anybody i have found there are areas that need attention that have had some historic neglect

6453126 and i just have to hope it doesnt rain all night because if it does it overflows
6453127 if a resident has a problem the site managers may say ill get to it
6453128 if residents are intimidated or harassed by a site manager residents can be afraid of them tenants need to let us know and well bring managers in and hold them accountable
6453129 so for instance if a property manager or maintenance supervisor is not telling headquarters about issues whether theyre crime related or complaints we dont know about them
6453130 there was an actual contract but because of a number of issues work got stopped and everybody dropped the ball and no one picked it up
6453131 we are changing managers and relocating managers we are restructuring were remanaging we have key people in the right places and people to be held accountable
6453132 when the contractor found asbestos in the roof it started a saga and the contractor refused to work on the roof
6453133 we may patch them up for now and we will rebid the whole roofing job
6453134 its very distressing that the residents of some of the housing authority developments have to live in these conditions
6453135 i think that all of the commissioners and staff should come and witness these very severe problems as soon as possible
6453136 its time to put closure on some of these things we can still make it a good place to live
6453137 theres no way we could have afforded a house before
6453138 my husband and i walked out of the closing jumped in the truck and just screamed
6453139 we had an awful lot of stretch buying above peoples means
6453140 everything happens for a reason now weve moved to a place where we can settle down survive and thrive
6453141 my life turned from being very active to basically coming to a grinding halt
6453142 they put it in and within a month i was up and running around doing stuff i had done in the past
6453143 one of the more exciting new product launches in our medical device universe
6453144 what the heartmate ii has done is to offer people who are in serious danger an option that they wouldnt have had before
6453145 not only do patients like it because its small but its quiet too with no sucking sound like the others
6453146 the last thing you want to have is spinach on your teeth and be obvious
6453147 historically vad therapy has been a low volume kind of therapy with a low level of awareness amongst the community of cardiologists
6453148 so now the challenge becomes how do we get the awareness of the therapy up so that both patients and doctors know theres another option out there
6453149 yeah we know were not hip but were doing the best we can with what weve got
6453150 in an ideal world our installers could handle these cases and complete the install but installers are complex beasts and in the interest of reducing complexity doing any of the above actions is unsupported

6453158 there is a central core of universal values that any truly modern society must possess and these are very much the values that science promotes rationality creativity the search for truth adherence to codes of behavior and a certain constructive subversiveness science requires much more than money and projects science requires freedom freedom to enquire to challenge to think and to envision the unimagined we must be able to question convention and arbitrate our disputes by the rules of evidence it is the content of scientific work that matters not the persons who produced it regardless of the color of their skin the god they choose to worship the ethnic group they were born into or their gender these are the values of science but even more they are societal values worth defending not just to promote the pursuit of science but to have a better and more humane society

6453160 madam not even the combined talents of lewis carroll and jonathan swift would have been capable of generating the high farce which the irish times delivered on thursday a billionaire businessman who refuses to contribute a cent towards running the country is given space in your pages to lecture the rest of us on how it should be done mr denis obrien is worth more than 2 billion and chooses to absent himself from this country for the bulk of the year in order to avoid paying tax here consequently it is the view of congress that he should not be afforded a public platform from which to lecture and hector those of us who do contribute
6453161 the real pull was that this was a country where only the elite had access to phones in a place like that he could get the masses to love him he paid 48 million for a license and rolled out a battle plan he would use on other invasions spend lavishly on the network 1 000 towers in jamaica build clean stores with cheery staff a rarity in many developing countries and lure customers by offering new services like per second billing and big discounts from the competition 80 less for phones and 50 less for calls
6453162 in an april riot in port au prince haiti the mob not only spared digicel stores from its burning and looting but even gathered in front of a few of them and cheered
6453163 commodore frank bainimarama had just seized power and subjected digicels chief there to a four hour interrogation
6453164 obrien has to fly to three more countries today and his next meeting is in vanuatu 3 200 miles away
6453165 my own businesses overseas have benefited from the expertise of officials from the department of foreign affairs
6453166 unfortunately mr obrien failed to furnish an address where we might forward the bill for the services of which he availed at our expense
6453167 government officials in papua new guinea werent so amenable at first
6453168 the eu funds png so do australia and new zealand so we used diplomacy
6453169 digicels critics say it has used underhand tactics such as giving away free phones to journalists though other firms do the same and breaking industry rules by treating haiti as part of jamaica in order to offer cheap roaming haitis regulator conatel found digicel to be in violation of international standards but was overruled by the government such rulings have also led to allegations that digicel has undue political influence in some markets
6453170 mr obrien claims he has grown used to all the criticism and suggests that jealous rival operators are behind it
6453171 the problem with them is that they are too flat footed
6453172 the achievements of middle class majority ethnic white irish students are not and never were under threat yet this ultimately is what is driving this campaign

6453193 were going to have 15 000 journalists from all over the world in colorado that is more than are at the olympics right now we want them to see what we already know we have a vibrant downtown that this is an exciting place we want them to really get a sense of what it is that makes denver so special and who knows so people watching in new york or l a may say maybe we should have an office in denver
6453194 all the information we have suggests its not going to be a serious problem at all the most recent numbers suggest less and less and less protestors there are some folks out there that want to cause a disturbance therell be a few of them well take care of it i dont see it as being a significant problem we have planned for any eventuality no matter what happens i think we have contingencies plans in place but we dont expect it to serious at all
6453195 its been almost two years weve been planning this thing all of our different agencies the public works police departments parks and recreation have all come together in just an incredible way its just a remarkable team we have
6453196 especially last winter when the primary kept going on and on it was tough
6453197 this compromise budget proposal puts our state on the road to fiscal sanity and will give california a budget that works
6453198 substituting one tax increase for another is not a bipartisan compromise nor will it solve our long term budget problems
6453199 increasing taxes on hardworking californians whether temporary or permanent is not only unnecessary it is irresponsible
6453200 i appreciate that the governor now believes that we need more revenues and well keep working with him and other legislative leaders to craft a balanced budget
6453201 i have made it very clear that we cannot tax our way out of this problem i do not believe in tax increases
6453202 i dont want to go back and ask them for any tax increases they deserve better than that
6453203 i think it is key for us that we finish this year with victories and not another year where nothing gets done just because everyone is stuck in their ideology
6453204 i keep hammering away at them every time i talk to them let us get together let us work this out dont come to the table with the same stubborn position

6453219 as journalists we have every right to carry out our duties without fear of harassment and physical assaults
6453220 we are kicked hit slapped around and ridiculed for doing our job or for telling the truth
6453221 early this month a chinese newspaper photographer was kicked choked and hit on the head while working

6453223 we call on the police and security forces to put in place effective crowd management measures to ensure such untoward incidences do not happen in the future

6453268 john mccain is so quick to throw nuclear waste in our backyard
6453269 really the challenge is finding storage strategies that are safe and can give people confidence
6453270 part of what we have to do is be honest with the american people not do a sell job but provide them with the information they need so they can feel confident with nuclear power even if it is located in their own communities
6453271 sometimes people are scared of nuclear power because of misinformation but part of it has to do with the fact we havent always been honest and straightforward about these issues
6453272 lets be clear our troops have completed every mission theyve been given they have created the space for political reconciliation
6453273 by using months old quotes and selective editing the obama ad distorts mccains assessment of the economy
6453274 to just say i dont know on the most divisive issue in america is not a clear enough answer for me
6453275 i dont even tell people that i am related to barack obama i dont want people here to be harassing me because they think i have money or influence
6453276 a smart kid who loves baseball and always works hard and comes ready to play
6453277 a lot of times kids arent ready to play at this level at buddys age but his natural ability work ethic and overall strong knowledge of the game have helped him do well which i feel is a precursor to what hell accomplish the next few years
6453278 as a hitter buddy was a good table setter for us in that almost always put the ball in play and could line drive to either gap and he was also solid behind the plate as he did a good job of blocking balls and mixing up the pitches he called
6453279 i like all aspects of catching whether its being able to try and throw people out blocking balls in the dirt or calling pitches
6453280 i like the responsibility of watching our pitchers before the game so i can see what pitch is looking the best and then have them go with that one the most
6453281 jason varitek works hard and plays the game the right way
6453282 he always hustles and gets down on balls in the dirt and when he makes an out he never goes crazy or throws his helmet hes a good leader and i try to be a good leader and set an example too by working hard and doing whatever the team needs in a certain situation
6453283 buddy isnt insanely vocal but i know that i can always talk to him about the game and hell give me his input while also accepting constructive criticism well because he knows the reason behind it is that were trying to get the best out of him
6453284 another thing about buddy is that he is not a rollercoaster he plays the game on an even keel so if he ever does make a bad play youll never see him slam his helmet or complain
6453285 complexity theory is a branch of mathematics that seeks to understand why certain problems are hard to compute
6453286 we know some problems are difficult but for many other problems that seem to be hard we cant rule out the possibility that there is some clever approach that makes them easy to compute
6453287 we may believe its inconceivable that a fast program for one of these problems can be found but we just cant be certain
6453288 there are no tools that actually prove how hard these are to compute and thats what we want to create
6453289 this will give our students the opportunity to be part of a highly demanding and inspiring academic effort
6453290 the collaboration will bring together some of the best minds in the field of computational complexity to stimulate new ideas and approaches to its increasingly difficult questions
6453291 late at night starring up at the ceiling i got you on my mind i cant sleep i think i need to see a doctor cuz this dont
6453292 this guy his mental capacities are not sufficient to make him a mastermind
6453293 my cousin was the person killed by danny not jeff i say this as a family member who realized long ago jeff had no part in my cousins murder and he shouldnt be executed its insane to kill another person who did not kill kris the video showed jeff took no part in it jeff was one of my friends growing up and someone i think deserves a chance if he didnt kill him why should we kill jeff this is ridiculous
6453294 if justice is about restoring a balance then how can we claim such a balance results from executing dennis skillicorn if his sentence were commuted to life imprisonment without parole the common good of our citizens would be served by his continued work on behalf of so many needy individuals

6453301 but secondhand smoke harms an involuntary population which has a constitutional right to clean air and a clean environment
6453302 we are lowering our third quarter estimates to reflect the difficult operating environment characterized by lower client related trading volumes and losses on hard to sell assets
6453303 based on further deterioration in several indices we expect further writedowns primarily related to mortgage assets
6453304 even under the potentially more stringent rating agency guidelines related to the amount of preferred securities in the capital mix we anticipate that lehman can absorb over 3 billion of after tax losses without adding more common equity
6453305 this could be the start of the recovery in the market and it will be these groups that lead the way in that case but we still need to see confirmation of the trend
6453306 there would be an upside of 30 percent from these levels if you believe in a real rebound but you dont need to buy the first 5 percent you can afford to wait for confirmation and still have ample opportunity to make money
6453307 we have to be careful the relief rally that we have seen over the last couple of weeks is really nothing other than a relief rally
6453308 the fundamental problems havent gone away were in the midst of a european recession were seeing earnings decline and we still expect further downgrades so the earnings side of the equation is still under heavy pressure
6453309 the market had definitely been ripe for a bump on the upside after julys floor and obviously hopes of lower interest rates have been helping
6453310 oils and materials came to a shuddering halt and investors moved out into the next story to pick the bottom in the financial sector and they were wrong
6453311 in relative terms consumer related stocks will outperform but we have to make the distinction between consumer discretionary and staples both sectors rallied but we would continue to shy away from discretionary and prefer staples as
6453312 the price to earnings ratio on marks amp spencer is 5 5 on a trailing 12 month basis if earnings were to halve that would be a p e of 11 with earnings at a cyclical low which sounds good
6453313 if you wanted to pick the best performing share over the next six months you wouldnt choose a miner you would try to find a department store on five times earnings
6453314 its important that they remain steadfast and not back down it would be a victory for terror and a loss for freedom if they did
6453315 not just an opportunity for hamas to build up arms

6453327 hes doing it and making it look so simple michael johnson did it and it didnt looked that easy
6453328 what an intense sadness the world should not lose such people so young

6453331 i just wanted to take a second to thank everyone for the support and blessings
6453332 it means a lot and i know that leroi feels the vibrations wherever his soul may be
6453333 our good friend leroi moore passed on today and gave up his ghost
6453334 we will miss him forever its always easier to leave than be left
6453335 he played the most beautiful version of somewhere over the rainbow id ever heard in my life
6453336 thats the day i fell in love with him im still in love with him
6453337 overall results are below expectations and we believe hocm is fully valued versus its peers

6453342 we see no value in remaining involved in a competitive process with the stanhill resources crosby consortium

6453440 hes fallen into line and doing the things were asking him to he understands what were expecting of him and hes giving us the effort
6453441 i would never in the same breath try to compare what im doing with what hes done or anything like that
6453442 he sort of stands alone not only in the history of the redskins but also in the national football league

6453468 the scale of the failure to plan for britains energy security has been brought into sharp relief by the georgian crisis which underlines the risks of increasing dependence on foreign energy sources as north sea oil supplies run down
6453469 we have an enormous opportunity to create real energy independence for the uk freeing ourselves from the shackles of foreign oil coal and gas
6453470 renewable energy is no longer a pipe dream it is realistic and achievable all it requires is the leadership and vision that has been lacking under years of tired labour thinking
6453471 thats why today i am setting out liberal democrat proposals to become energy independent by 2050 this will require the kind of ambition and political will that succeeded in putting man on the moon
6453472 much of what nick clegg has said is a carbon copy of conservative policy
6453473 but his overall conclusions defy reality to deny the looming energy gap and to pretend that with his policies he can realistically become the prophet of total energy independence for the uk is irresponsible and verges on the loopy
6453474 nick clegg is absolutely right to call for a green energy revolution the only sustainable future for the uk is one based on a combination of renewable energy and energy efficiency

6453486 once again the majority of our negative estimate revisions are being driven by higher than estimated write downs on mortgage assets
6453487 also seeing results being negatively impacted by slower levels of client activity and expenses and fines from auction rate securities

6453491 rio will be fine he knew he had a good chance of being captain and then the gaffer capello picked john terry so we all just get on with it now
6453492 rio has got a great attitude is a great footballer and i am sure he will take it in his stride and continue to do well for his country and united
6453493 i play alongside him every week so he would have been my choice but then the chelsea players would have said exactly the same about john terry
6453494 he has been a great captain for us and hopefully he can take us all the way to the world cup finals in two years time
6453495 ive had a bad time the last few months my dad and my sister passed away so it is just good for me to still be playing
6453496 the goal today was great and i am sure they would have been proud if looking down at wembley
6453497 my family has always helped me along the way so i am sure they would have been watching and happy for me
6453498 i think we will have to play significantly better if we are to beat croatia out there we know we can do that i am sure we will have more days training more days to prepare and we will be ready for the game
6453499 we can play a lot better than against the czechs we were good at times very scrappy at times but the team spirit is high and hopefully we can take that into the qualifying games
6453500 the lads are getting to know each other a lot more now we know what the gaffer wants and we are just trying to bring that into the game
6453501 as for myself i know it is going to be difficult to stay in the first team for 10 years ive been in and out so i just try and battle away and keep on going

6453513 gathering comprehensive data about the dead from civilians is a time consuming task
6453514 we have to cross check data and check that people are not misidentified or miscounted
6453515 we have to make sure there is no double counting if a body is moved we have to be careful not to count it twice maybe it is counted once in the village itself and then it could be counted again in the city morgue
6453516 to get really accurate figures you would really have to go to every single village
6453517 we do take allegations of arrests of people missing or reported dead we can also offer our services to the authorities for the transfer of mortal remains
6453518 all the work we do is gathering confidential information which we share with the authorities with the aim of finding out the location of loved ones for the civilian population
6453519 there has been a lot of controversy about the russian figures
6453520 when that figure came out of 1 500 dead it wasnt very helpful it didnt provide any sourcing or methodology there were no details about how the figure was calculated we certainly cant confirm it
6453521 the problem here is that when russia puts out a figure like that it does two things it distracts attention from where there are violations and from the real scale of what is happening
6453522 if you have a military objective then the grad rocket is not a targeted weapon civilians are going to get hit and that is exactly what happened and happened on a significant scale the proximity was such that it was indiscriminate
6453523 the rule is that disproportionate attacks are prohibited in other words if you have your eye on a military target and there is likely to be civilian damage excessive in relation to the expected military gain you dont fire
6453524 we have numerous stories of ossetian forces roving around ethnic georgian villages running around looting homes torching them
6453525 the state government and the launceston city council have signed a legally binding deed governing the provision and draw down of funds for the launceston flood risk management project
6453526 this is a significant funding package designed to help protect the homes and businesses of launceston residents
6453527 limits on development in the invermay area are a vital component of the deed preconditions because it is not feasible to completely eliminate the risk of flooding to the invermay area
6453528 in order to compete in the extremely competitive confectionery sector in the future we need to make changes now
6453529 when implemented these changes will reduce complexity remove duplication and improve capacity allowing us to be more innovative and responsive to consumer needs
6453530 from where we were early this morning hearing lots of rumours obviously its not as bad as it looked
6453531 the fact that they are investing is good news but the loss of 160 jobs is pretty devastating
6453532 we re not convinced its only going to be 160 its something well have to have some discussions on
6453533 we understand that this is a very difficult time for some of our employees
6453534 we have a long history of supporting our employees whenever we need to make changes to the business and if the proposal proceeds we will ensure every affected employee receives their full redundancy entitlements as well as comprehensive career planning and support services
6453535 it will be all about them what they like what they do what they wear and what issues they are facing as the youth of today

6453543 these submissions are being assessed in the same manner as others submitted and will now continue to be so assessed on a case by case basis
6453544 the latest affidavit filed by the central government before the supreme court states that over 400 cases have been registered against members of simi for indulging in unlawful activities and blasts in various places including the july 26 blasts in ahmedabad

6453557 millions of beneficiaries rely on social security benefits as their only source of income for basic needs such as housing and food
6453558 when a creditors garnishment order is enforced and these federal funds withheld the lives of a vulnerable segment of the population are placed at risk
6453559 i am a single mom of 2 kids and have a disability income my husband has left and we have a lot of debt there is a court order from a law firm that represents a creditor who has frozen my credit union account this is the only money i have for food gas and utilities
6453560 i was at one time a gainfully employed registered nurse before an injury i do hope to get back to the work force one day but right now my saving grace is that disability income
6453561 i just got back from the bank with all of my money i told the bank manager about the info you provided in the post about the law concerning my income and she immediately released my money god bless you i would have never known on my own
6453562 this advice is dead wrong take the credit and pay the money toward the mortgage
6453563 saves the buyer at most just a few hundred dollars a year the annual value of the forgone interest this seems like a very small amount to influence the decision of anxious new buyers waiting on the markets sideline
6453564 technically by the numbers people would be unambiguously better off taking the 7 500 credit and using it to immediately pay down their mortgage
6453565 but its too easy for most people to forget that they still owe that 7500 back at 500 a year and to plan accordingly they arent stupid its just that our lives are designed in a way that makes it easy to put off forget ignore distant financial pressures

6453569 his death is a great loss not only to people of zambia but also to sadc southern african development community and comesa common market for eastern and southern africa regions and indeed to the entire african continent
6453570 zimbabwe shares your sorrow during this period of bereavement and mourning
6453571 if you go from heathrow to athens icao gives 217 kilograms kg of co2 that hides huge variations fly in a full boeing b767 and its nearer to 160 kg per person or fly in a half empty airbus a340 and its more like 360 kg
6453572 its the variations that are missing and that are important

6453574 theres a myriad of geopolitical factors rumbling in the background russia iran
6453575 as prices drop saudi arabia may cut back on its recent increase in production which could halt the most recent price decline
6453576 suggests that the risks for further economic weakening in the near term remain elevated
6453577 de voorbije dagen waren zeker niet makkelijk maar dit maakt al veel goed
6453578 het was een verraderlijke race door die natte piste die het extra gevaarlijk maakte we hadden geen schrik maar eerder positieve stress op een paar kleine foutjes na hebben we het goed gedaan we gaan er niet te veel bij stilstaan dat we de derde tijd liepen we moeten nu goed rusten en morgen alles geven
6453579 ik probeer het te relativeren en denk vooral aan alles wat me w l gelukt is gefrustreerd worden heeft weinig zin
6453580 im just really happy its hard work for my entire life that came through now
6453581 i trained really hard for this and im just really happy that i finally get a medal in my individual event
6453582 i think my training was going really well and i was able tonight to stay focused on what i had to do and not stay focused on my result or on how the other divers were doing i think that was the big key
6453583 i think its what happened in the past that made the person that i am today and made me dive like this today
6453584 im just going to enjoy the moment and think about the future later
6453585 i was a little surprised that i was leading but i was sure that it was really close
6453586 i knew that the chinese diver had a really good last dive and she could do it for 10s most of the time
6453587 saya cukup puas meski secara umum para pemain masih melakukan kesalahan mendasar di pertandingan yang akan datang saya akan berusaha memperbaiki kesalahan tersebut dan akan tampil lebih baik
6453588 saya tidak cukup puas dengan kepemimpinan wasit di lapangan yang banyak membela pemain indonesia meski kami tidak memiliki target khusus dalam turnamen ini di pertandinagan kedua nanti kami akan berjuang sekuat tenaga dan berharap mampu meraih hasil yang lebih bagus
6453589 the scale of the failure to plan for britains energy security has been brought into sharp relief by the georgian crisis which underlines the risks of increasing dependence on foreign energy sources as north sea oil supplies run down
6453590 we have an enormous opportunity to create real energy independence for the uk freeing ourselves from the shackles of foreign oil coal and gas
6453591 renewable energy is no longer a pipe dream it is realistic and achievable all it requires is the leadership and vision that has been lacking under years of tired labour thinking
6453592 thats why today i am setting out liberal democrat proposals to become energy independent by 2050 this will require the kind of ambition and political will that succeeded in putting man on the moon
6453593 much of what nick clegg has said is a carbon copy of conservative policy
6453594 but his overall conclusions defy reality to deny the looming energy gap and to pretend that with his policies he can realistically become the prophet of total energy independence for the uk is irresponsible and verges on the loopy
6453595 nick clegg is absolutely right to call for a green energy revolution the only sustainable future for the uk is one based on a combination of renewable energy and energy efficiency
6453596 my music has gotten more intense brutal ferocious and insanely tight with mick brown drums and greg smith bass pounding me into submission every night
6453597 we are the tightest most dangerous band in the history of the world
6453598 fiscale en budgettaire ingrepen zijn vandaag hoogst noodzakelijk willen we niet in een krimpende economie terechtkomen
6453599 de tegenvallende fiscale ontvangsten stonden in de sterren geschreven maar toch verkoos de regering om te geloven in een heropleving
6453600 hoog tijd dat reynders met duidelijke cijfers op de proppen komt en de realiteit onder ogen ziet fiscale en budgettaire ingrepen zijn vandaag hoogst noodzakelijk willen we niet in een krimpende economie terechtkomen
6453601 how much insurance to buy to offset the small chance of a ruinous catastrophe that is difficult to compensate by ordinary savings
6453602 i came here for a medal and im not even in the final
6453603 i think i was maybe trying to hard to force a good start
6453604 i just didnt feel as comfortable as i did in the heat i will be beating myself up now if i wasnt already over the last few days i was just hoping this was going to be another preparation for the finals
6453605 im a lot older and more experienced im not coming in as a darkhorse any more im coming in as a favourite
6453606 my expectations are for a perfect race if we have a perfect race then you can expect great things in our field if youre less than perfect from start to finish then its all over

6453623 while many americans are living paycheck to paycheck to effectively protect ourselves for the future we need to start saving paycheck to paycheck
6453624 our study shows that americans are better at saving money when they are thinking about it month to month on an ongoing basis rather than a long term goal
6453625 we plan on pay raises work bonuses and other monies to come forward but we cannot be thinking this way we need to start saving money every day
6453626 planning too far in advance not only makes consumers over optimistic regarding how much they will save but it also makes them behave in more aggressive and risk seeking ways in other financial arenas
6453627 the easiest thing to do is to be a smarter consumer and make spending and saving decisions thoughtfully on a daily basis that extra cup of coffee every morning carpooling with a co worker and cutting out the extras
6453628 the harder and more prudent thing to do is to mindfully take a portion of your earnings each pay period and save it in the bank
6453629 americans cant solely depend on their retirement plan it will be painful but like that mortgage or car loan payment we need to start thinking about a savings transfer every pay period
6453630 the effects of time frames on personal savings estimates savings behavior and financial decision making
6453631 es una plaga dif cil de controlar es un verdadero problema por eso se deben de tomar acciones cuanto antes
6453632 le estamos solicitando a las personas que no recojan nada de las calles muchas personas se admiran de ver tiradas cosas nuevas en las calles y se las llevan para sus casas pensando que tuvieron una gran suerte y muchas de estas cosas est n tiradas y se encuentran superpobladas de chinches o huevos que se convertir n en una plaga y en un dolor de cabeza para las personas que recogieron muebles camas sillones etc
6453633 no comprar o recoger en las calles colchones usados y comprar siempre aquellos que sean nuevos
6453634 en nuestra experiencia hemos encontrado chinchas en colchones nuevos la gente debe de combatir la plaga y para eso se necesita un experto que sabe como atacar el problema de las plagas sin poner en peligro la salud de las familias ya que muchas familias compran l quidos altamente peligrosos aplic ndolo de una manera incorrecta donde se encuentran ni os ancianos y animales dom sticos que resultan altamente da inos para toda la familias
6453635 were trying to identify in the trichoplax genes that are also found in other animals our genome and the fruit fly genome and so on
6453636 a big effort and a big investment and so we have to choose carefully
6453637 the motivation for choosing this animal was its phylogenetic position
6453638 a tiny little pancake of cells you can barely see without a microscope
6453639 and theyre extremely simple about as simple as you can be just a disc of cells thats two layers thick
6453640 well thats one of the main questions im going after now that im setting up my own lab
6453641 is there a reason theyre together and if they get separated by a mutation does that disrupt some mechanism of gene regulation or cause some other problem for an organism
6453642 but its a very clear question and ive decided to try to find the answer to that
6453643 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6453644 the speakers will address john mccains unmatched record of service and sacrifice for america and his vision for moving our nation forward to keep us safe and get our economy back on track
6453645 we are excited to announce this slate of speakers each of whom shares john mccains love of country and commitment to serving a cause greater than ones own self interest their remarks will be a testament to senator mccains unparalleled record of service and sacrifice for america and his readiness to lead as commander in chief and move america forward
6453646 love of country my friends is another way of saying love of your fellow countryman
6453647 if you find faults with our country make it a better one if you are disappointed with the mistakes of government join its ranks and correct them
6453648 our next president will have a mandate to build an enduring global peace on the foundations of freedom security opportunity prosperity and hope
6453649 ho incontrato david laltro giorno e durante una colazione al beverly hills hotel gli ho spiegato dettagliatamente come abbiamo deciso di sviluppare la nuova serie e lui ha dato la sua approvazione
6453650 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6453651 ur sony ericsson catalog downstairs ah go see which model u want
6453652 why everytime ask you out not free mom wants to go singtel to buy phone this sat u want to go
6453653 your phone bil downstairs on the bar i dare not open ah u open urself
6453654 you know what i think im going to go insane
6453655 you know that you are on the front line in the fight against the taliban
6453656 you know that by what you are doing here you prevent terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6453657 you make our country proud every day of the week and every week of the year
6453658 they were wearing khaki their weapons were american the humvees they used looked american
6453659 they didnt have any ranks on their shoulders they didnt talk
6453660 at about 12 30 an iraqi force entered the building they were in seven humvees and two black gmcs they took all the weapons from the guards when the secretary abbas al timimi tried to go to the operational command building he was shot dead without a word he is a civilian he wasnt carrying any weapons
6453661 security forces put him down he said im the president of diyala university and ive done nothing wrong they told him to shut up and started shooting down the doors upstairs they brook into closets and took things from our room and others about 10 million iraqi dinars equivalent to 8 000 two mobile phones a laptop computer
6453662 health plans should not be allowed to apply unfair treatment limitations or financial requirements on mental health benefits
6453663 if he is not suicidal but hes a dangerous to others you can call the police those are my two options given what has happened in portland with the portland police i certainly did not want to depend on that option and when i called multnomah county services i got the same answer
6453664 as a parent of a son with autism i know how frustrated ive been at the lack of a coordinated state response to this epidemic
6453665 the same vague ideas the same vague measurements the same vague recommendations as 1996 im really disgusted because to me these people are part of the problem here
6453666 whatever were doing now is preparation for work that we come into the legislative session prepared to do rather than doing a study for the sake of doing a study and setting it on a shelf and not paying attention to it
6453667 it is absolutely critical both in maintaining quality and from a human ethics standpoint for any organization that claims to serve a particular segment of the population to have members of that segment of the population at the policy level of that organization you must include actual autistic individuals on your committee moving forward
6453668 all it says is explore specific health insurance coverage i think it needs to say develop and pass insurance legislation that covers physician directed intensive treatments for asd
6453669 and i said what would you do if you had a child with this disability their response was i would move i would leave the state
6453670 satisfied customers tell three friends angry customers tell 3 000 his message is particularly important for eco entrepreneurs so im summarizing some of his talk for you green business entrepreneurs
6453671 your brand equity is the sum total of your companys search results
6453672 feedback pages generally say dont talk to me why not invest in good design and make it easy for customers to give you good ideas and to let you know what they do like so you are sure not to mess with that
6453673 the other publishers hand any sense would combine against them and suppress them
6453674 in my capacity as reader i applaud the penguin books in my capacity as writer i pronounce them anathema hutchinsons are now bringing out a very similar edition though only of their own books and if the other publishers follow suit the result may be a flood of cheap reprints which will cripple the lending libraries the novelists foster mother and check the output of new novels this would be a fine thing for literature but it would be a very bad thing for trade and when you have to choose between art and money well finish it for yourself
6453675 this is a great place to look for over 100k jobs
6453676 im sure he mccain loves his country its just that loving your country and lying to the american people are apparently not inconsistent in his view
6453677 britney is a song about what our culture says and does to young women these days its about the lies we tell them about fame and money and whats beautiful and what will give them life its an apology for those lies but more than that its an invitation to the truth about a god who is bigger than the pain this world so often leaves them in
6453678 la pelota da la sensaci n de pesar m s
6453679 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6453680 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defence site here in poland that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missiles from countries like iran or north korea
6453681 the first indication that this signing was going to happen took place a few days ago mid conflict between russia and georgia i might add where poland indicated it was willing to allow the us to station its missile defence shield on its territory
6453682 thats the main concern here and what we have been seeing over the past few days is russia acting accordingly to beef up its own defences as well
6453683 we have heard some incendiary comments from the ministry of defence here that poland would now be perhaps a new target for russian missiles
6453684 the tragedy in all of this confrontation with russia is that the system thats proposed for poland and the czech republic is a scarecrow
6453685 its not something that europe can rely on it is not dependable
6453686 if iran had missiles that could reach central europe which they dont yet this system couldnt be relied on to defend against them anyway
6453687 some of this may be just a threat but russia has shown in just the past week or so it has a formidable military force so if i were poland or the czech republic i would be more worried about russia than i would be about iran or north korea
6453688 for that reason no one who has good intentions toward us and toward the western world should be afraid of it
6453689 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent
6453690 how do you know if you have what it takes to be a writer
6453691 new and likely to be viewed with suspicion by both sides
6453692 whether he will have the political courage to really sell it
6453693 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
6453694 and i also feel that americans want us to work together you know former pennsylvania gov tom ridge r is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
6453695 that does not mean we exclude people from our party who are pro choice
6453696 picks a pro choice running mate its not going to be pretty
6453697 effectively destroy ing the republican party and push ing the conservative movement to the bleachers
6453698 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
6453699 was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe v wade
6453700 the words person human being child and individual shall include every infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development
6453701 occurs as a result of natural or induced labor caesarean section or induced abortion
6453702 on the childs behalf for damages including costs of care to preserve and protect the life health and safety of the child punitive damages and costs and attorneys fees against a hospital health care facility or health care provider who harms or neglects the child or fails to provide medical care to the child after the childs birth
6453703 was moving to quash only a narrow and innocuous definitional bill identical to federal law
6453704 i can tell you the sponsors always wanted the entire package of bills which were introduced together and analyzed together
6453705 they never wanted them separated because they wanted to make sure that physicians would be chilled into not performing abortions for fear of going to jail
6453706 we could learn a lot from the chinese someone there causes problems and wham the gummint beats them down no more problem
6453707 we see it all the time ive been working here for years but its really got worse over the past two years
6453708 what a lot of people do is walk and takes their mail physically down to the
6453709 it then goes into so many different sections and thats when things go missing
6453710 dvla currently handles around 2 million items of incoming mail per month with a further 100 000 items being generated internally for distribution
6453711 these are handled daily by a dedicated team and we are not aware of any significant issues relating to the efficiency of the service
6453712 one of the issues with rape victims who dont know their assailants is that they are at high risk of exposure to hiv
6453713 the medication is not easy to take and it is not affordable for women you have women walk out with the prescription but never get it filled
6453714 women are not just getting the medication but follow up care as well
6453715 although the strikers scored four goals between them they could easily have had another four each but well work on that
6453716 i thought they could have scored more goals and it should have been a higher score
6453717 that wont happen against harder teams so weve got to work on things
6453718 having said that you cant complain about winning 5 2 so im quite content with the start we had
6453719 we switched off and there was bad marking but the players admitted it so hopefully theyve learned their lesson three points was the main thing
6453720 well have to work on a lot of things yet to get where we want to be but well get there
6453721 the results went with us on saturday and we got three points which was the main thing at the end of the day
6453722 ive said over the past two or three years that if you can win your first six or seven games its a big bonus
6453723 the confidence comes in and youre winning games and teams are trying to catch you up so its important to win at least the first five or six which is not easy to do
6453724 we have competition for places in every position and theyve got to put the performance in or they dont play

6453739 at the visitation friday for billie jefferson it felt just like home
6453740 sse has concluded that the best route to the site will still be via the turning at the old school house and strath brora an application for listed building consent will therefore be lodged shortly
6453741 the old school house building will be renovated as part of the works this will enable it to be returned to a beneficial use at the end of the project and to improve its overall appearance
6453742 it remains my view that an extension to the kilbraur wind farm road offered an ideal access solution for the gordonbush wind farm and i had hoped there could be a successful conclusion to the engineering site assessment and the negotiation of access agreements with the relevant land owners for this route any proposal to use the a9 through golspie and brora is a cause of great concern and can only result in nuisance extreme disturbance and potential structural damage to the road and to neighbouring properties
6453743 in the past i have made written representations to the scottish government and highland council on this matter and urged them to secure an access using the established kilbraur wind farm route with a comparatively short extension to strath brora
6453744 this route would leave the a9 south of golspie at drummuie travel up to dunrobin glen and on through the existing kilbraur wind farm development
6453745 this would result in no significant traffic movement through a built up area this is a clear transport solution which avoids the two settlements of golspie and brora
6453746 i will now be in contact with sse to seek clarification of the situation and if the intended route is via the old school house i will seek a full explanation of the reasons the kilbraur route is not to be used
6453747 the separatist government of south ossetia begins evacuating civilians at 12 00 the south ossetian separatist government announces the evacuation of more than 500 people including about 400 children however ermak dzansolov deputy prime minister of russias north ossetian republic tells russias interfax news agency that this is not in fact an evacuation he explains that the children had long planned to attend a summer camp program in north ossetia
6453748 if it looks like a despot walks like a tyrant quacks like an assailant it is
6453749 the residents are delighted with the renovations its given them more independence every room is now en suite and the layout gives the residents more dignity and comfort
6453750 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
6453751 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine

6453755 the worlds pretty serious right now and theres an ironic lightness in virulents
6453756 theres a touch of macabre ridiculousness to it i think weve seen a lot of attempts to make serious movies about serious things and it strikes me that we might be a little more artful about how we make a point these days
6453757 i think the dark knight for example is probably the most socially relevant film in the past two three four years despite many attempts to make very serious movies
6453758 dark knight talks to our decision making ability in the world whether or not we can distinguish between good and evil and its done in a way more artful form than ramming something down someones throat which is why virulents appeals to me
6453759 mark wahlberg we had a hell of a time on max payne i think hes an actor of unlimited potential and id just love to go around with him again but were not in control of these things lots of big people with big checkbooks get to do that if its going to happen then the karma makes it happen
6453760 my opponent is a good guy ive known him for years but the reality is hes only a few years younger than i am
6453761 and his chances of being in a position im in not only for kentucky agriculture but kentucky in general is slim to say the least
6453762 leviathan 99 have their origins in his long ago days as a hollywood screenwriter these explanations hang on in the listeners mind and provide insights and color for the stories that follow
6453763 rorschachs complexity is interesting too because its an attacking complexity he tries to simplify the world in black and white we live in such a world of grays that its next to impossible and i just love the way he does it playing this guy i almost went nuts just trying to reconcile that aspect of him i just kept staring deeper and deeper and deeper into complexity to try and define it and how you can black and white this
6453764 the best way i can describe what i mean is that rorschach thinks that youre not what you say you mean youre what you do you are your behavior
6453765 that sort of forced me to look at my own behavior to ask myself whos my behavior victimizing today it doesnt have to be on such a scale where somebody is getting murdered it may be just be some self centered thing that im doing thats making my wife stay a little more miserable or my kids we justify our behavior with complexity not for rorschach
6453766 ne uccide pi la penna che la spada paura eh
6453767 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6453768 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6453769 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6453770 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6453771 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6453772 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6453773 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6453774 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6453775 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

6453788 medication adherence is also a well known problem in a chronic disorder like adhd with only about 20 percent of patients remaining on the same medication 15 months after first being prescribed that medication the need for multiple daily dosing of immediate release medications only further increases the risk of nonadherence in children adolescents and adults as there is a significant likelihood that one of the parents of a child with adhd will also have adhd often undiagnosed or another psychiatric disorder there is potentially a significant risk that the parent will forget to give the additional immediate release doses of medication to the child every 4 to 6 hours
6453789 researchers say grapefruit juice has been known to dangerously increase the amount of medication absorbed into the body particularly drugs for high cholesterol and high blood pressure but a new study by the same researchers has found that apple orange and grapefruit juice may also decrease the absorption of some meds including drugs commonly used to treat diabetes cancer allergies and some antibiotics
6453790 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6453791 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6453792 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6453793 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6453794 with regards to the trails to which hetfield has now restricted access as the story spread and other people commented many other people felt the same way

6453798 a jests prosperity lies in the ear of him that hears it never in the tongue of him who makes it
6453799 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6453800 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6453801 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6453802 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6453803 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6453804 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6453805 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6453806 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6453807 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6453808 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6453809 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6453810 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6453811 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6453812 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6453813 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6453814 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6453815 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6453816 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6453817 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6453818 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

6453825 he is quoted as saying that israeli arms sales to the georgian army should prompt the kremlin to strengthen the military alliance between russia and syria
6453826 i want to voice support for russia over the situation around abkhazia and south ossetia
6453827 we understand the essence of the russian position and consider its military reaction a response to provocation by the georgian side
6453828 syria was and is striving to develop strategic relations with russia in the interests of security in the whole world
6453829 one plan on the table in moscow debkafiles sources report is the establishment of big russian military naval and air bases in syria and the release of advanced weapons systems withheld until now to iran the s 300 air missile defense system and syria the nuclear capable 200 km range iskandar surface missile
6453830 we must freeze talks with syria until it stops calling on moscow to arm israels enemies and until damascus itself stops transferring arms to hizbullah

6453833 israels defense industries managed to sell to georgia drones automatic turrets for armored vehicles antiaircraft systems communication systems shells and rockets
6453834 israel has reportedly helped upgrade soviet designed su 25 ground attack jets assembled in georgia and former israeli generals serve as advisers to the georgian military
6453835 plans to establish a long term presence inside georgia and one of its breakaway republics
6453836 if implemented the plan would effectively put under russian control the border between georgia and south ossetia which is seeking independence as well as a small chunk of georgia proper
6453837 quite conservative in its projections of obesity prevalence and estimates of attributable fractions for conditions associated with obesity diabetes cardiovascular disease various types of cancer and osteoarthritis
6453838 these new figures are tragic and frightening and represent a wake up call for the nation
6453839 they show that previous estimates of the epidemics size and cost were very much understated
6453840 we know that obesity and type two diabetes can be prevented and we need to make fundamental changes in the way we live to arrest the escalating crisis
6453841 the institute for information law ivir of the university of amsterdam is a leading research institute in the field of european copyright law in 2006 and 2007 ivir produced two major studies on eu copyright law and policy
6453842 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

6453845 winona didnt waste any time she and tom were all over each other laughing and carrying on
6453846 her impressive suite of financial information technology and management capabilities developed over a distinguished career makes her the ideal candidate to lead our finance organization
6453847 we have taken our time in making these appointments we have taken soundings from influential people in our industry
6453848 we are creating something special in london which mirrors culturally our success across the other golley slater offices and disciplines in the uk
6453849 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6453850 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6453851 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6453852 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6453853 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6453854 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6453855 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6453856 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6453857 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6453858 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6453859 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6453860 er war finanziell und wegen des h ngigen asylgesuchs von seiner frau abh ngig ihr gest ndnis bedeutete f r ihn den verlust der aufenthalts und existenzgrundlage
6453861 despite these numbers and the recent wave of public support congress remains in the way of creating a comprehensive energy policy with all options on the table including development of domestic resources more conservation and energy efficiency
6453862 now is the time for congress to ease restrictions on non park non wilderness federal lands out west and lift the ban on offshore drilling
6453863 josh has come into this camp focused and competitive and much more serious about his craft he just has a much more professional attitude than he had as a rookie you see it in the meeting room you see it out on the practice field on a daily basis he gets better because of it
6453864 i was thinking about what happened to greg last year
6453865 the truth is we were a mediocre team and i was a mediocre player however we still had the husky pride even though the program was on a downturn and pretty much everybody knew it was going to be jim owens last year what i really remember and held onto we were still huskies when you played the husky team you knew you were going to get hit
6453866 eylander without question kept us in the game he had seven saves and all of them were good ones
6453867 deandre is amazing he has a lot of experience and is an incredibly hard worker hes simply brutal on the field but thats the way you need to be hes made me a much better player i had to put on about 20 pounds this year to survive the practices with him
6453868 theyll stay here and swim instead of going out with their parents instead of be here at 5 and be there at 6 they can just be kids theyre excited
6453869 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6453870 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6453871 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6453872 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6453873 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6453874 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6453875 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6453876 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6453877 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6453878 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6453879 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6453880 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6453881 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6453882 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6453883 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6453884 who are open to doing something on the production side
6453885 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6453886 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6453887 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6453888 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6453889 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6453890 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6453891 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

6453899 trotz der gefahr im verzug hat die bundesregierung bis heute keine politischen aktivit ten gesetzt wie in partei bergreifenden resolutionen in sechs landtagen gefordert durch die neuwahlen und anschlie ende regierungsbildung drohen weitere inakzeptable zeitverluste
6453900 wir m chten die bundesregierung daher an ihre verantwortung gegen ber den menschen dieses landes und an ihre pflichten erinnern damit die l ngst berf lligen schritte unverz glich noch vor der nationalratswahl gesetzt werden
6453901 die bundesregierung muss prim r eine klare ablehnung dieser inakzeptablen und unn tigen bedrohung bei den regierungen der slowakei und italiens deponieren und sie ersuchen von der realisierung des projektes mochovce 3 und 4 abstand zu nehmen
6453902 diese schritte k nnen das wegen ungesicherter finanzierung und bedenken der eu kommission schwer angeschlagene projekt bereits endg ltig zum fall bringen
6453903 die eu kommission u erte schwere bedenken zur sicherheit des mochovce projektes und fordert den nachweis einer mit dem containment moderner druckwasserreaktoren vergleichbaren schutzniveaus
6453904 es ist jedoch klar dass die mochovce reaktoren diese bedingung niemals erf llen k nnen genau an diesem punkt m ssen die sterreichischen aktivit ten ansetzen
6453905 die bundesregierung muss die regierungen der slowakei und italiens unverz glich zu internationalen konsultationen zur sicherheit des akw mochovce auffordern
6453906 der von der eu kommission verlangte sicherheitsnachweis f r die schutzh lle muss auf dringend expertenebene behandelt werden

6453910 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

6453923 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6453924 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6453925 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6453926 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6453927 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6453928 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6453929 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6453930 um i can come over tonight i mean if that works out for you you know um just in case um yeah i can come over tonight or next week whatever you want
6453931 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6453932 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6453933 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6453934 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

6453960 its a chain of command thing you dont want to give autonomy to a weapons delivery system you want to have a human hit the button
6453961 you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions

6453963 when the game was over we were all a little perplexed after all why would teams from the american football conference play in canada eh sure it said the buffalo bills were playing on my ticket but i just figured that this football stuff was some sort of elaborate pre game show for a hockey game

6453993 pictures of ronald reagan you can debate whether ronald reagan was good or bad but the point is everything he said he stood for is being put to the sword by george bush but i wont even have that debate with you george bush is a puppet i refuse to live in this false reality with you the country is dying weve been de industrialized weve been strip mined politically economically and spiritually
6453994 i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogue of satan
6453995 how can you instil democracy when your political position is that of indiscriminate warfare
6453996 admiral mullen us will stand by israel for next 1 000 years
6453997 this isnt golf we dont get a do over we cant let this president wage war and kill more people in violation of international law and violation of the geneva convention his conduct is in violation of the nuremberg principles we need to hold him to account and if we do that there wont be an attack on iran

6454001 taliban fighters are guilty of nothing but standing in defense of the innocent victims of 911
6454002 the taliban may have been a lot of things but they werent corrupt
6454003 as nazi tanks crossed into poland in 1939 an american senator declared lord if only i could have talked to hitler all of this might have been avoided we have an obligation to call this what it is the false comfort of appeasement which has been repeatedly discredited by history

6454008 zionists believe israel should not be defended from war criminals who bomb jewish communities indiscriminately to murder children with millions of landmines
6454009 you could almost see their dicks getting hard as they got new ideas
6454010 this barbarous act has no place among civilized peoples and shocks the conscience of all peace loving nations there is no cause that could ever justify this action
6454011 the politicians that we vote for wont stay and fight and they wont count the votes
6454012 the world should respect any action taken by ungodly zionist evil israel in order to defend its citizens
6454013 i grabbed her little sister and put her in front of me as the bullets began to fly the blood sprayed from between her eyes and then i laughed maniacally
6454014 the mass murdered unarmed innocent neighbors back door was open
6454015 it amounts to collective punishment and is contrary to international humanitarian law
6454016 more than 250 torture victims come forward to sue caci
6454017 our government has no power except that granted it by the people
6454018 the pentagon is seeking executions of innocent torture victims who allege they did every last terrorist act of the last 50 years

6454027 the marines have landed and we now as enron own a piece of afghanistan
6454028 it is not george bush it is not the neocons
6454029 i just want to point out that were going to encourage the people to look at the evidence for themselves
6454030 those who negotiate in the name of the taliban will be killed
6454031 if the absence of violence is victory no one will ever win
6454032 it is not george bush it is not the neocons
6454033 this document does not purport to provide a prosecutable case against usama bin laden in a court of law

6454042 you have 6 months to build the ark before the rains commence and they will last for 40 days and 40 nights
6454043 im about to start the rain where is the ark
6454044 im still trying to resolve a complaint with the human rights

6454057 the new york police department violated core constitutional rights when it arrested a group of peaceful demonstrators who were lawfully protesting against the commencement of the iraq war and those who stood to profit from it
6454058 my question is why did the nypd send over 100 police in riot gear along with vehicles to block the street and disrupt the flow of morning rush hour traffic all to stop a legal peaceful protest when there are far more important matters they could be pursuing and why did they fight us in court so doggedly when they knew the evidence proved that we were arrested without any police orders to leave
6454059 we hope our victory helps convince the city to stop violating peoples rights as a matter of policy and stop wasting taxpayers money doing so
6454060 it should also serve as a reminder that washingtons illegal war in afghanistan and iraq is also being fought at home against its own citizens and in the name of war profiteers like carlyle and halliburton we intend to continue our resistance until this stops

6454155 most physicians in the united states have financial relationships with industry ranging from the acceptance of meals to the receipt of large sums of money for consulting speaking or conducting research
6454156 consumers should absolutely know where their doctor is coming from
6454157 doctors think they wont be influenced by these financial relationships but the research shows that they are
6454158 lets say your investment counselor went on a trip to aruba paid for by a certain company
6454159 then he comes home and recommends you invest in that company wouldnt you be concerned
6454160 look around for hints that your doctor sees a lot of drug reps
6454161 and if you see an extremely attractive impeccably dressed polite person with a briefcase in the waiting room watch out thats most likely a drug rep
6454162 ask the doctor whats the scientific evidence for prescribing that particular drug over another one they must have a scientific reason especially if its a high price brand name drug instead of a generic
6454163 there are circumstances where you want to take this extra step and there are other times where you really dont want to bother
6454164 the first priority of physicians is the health and well being of our patients

6454169 engineering today is unusually fast paced and requires an uncommon blend of knowledge and skill along technological humanistic and artistic dimensions
6454170 the current engineering curriculum was established in the cold war and needs to be reexamined and overhauled now
6454171 curriculum change is thwarted by the very way in which colleges and schools of engineering are organized
6454172 even when the need for big changes is widely acknowledged at the time of a vote the curriculum passed is the curriculum of the past with minor tweaks
6454173 ifoundry will allow us to make meaningful changes such as strengthening the creative capacity of our students while preserving the technical excellence that has been the hallmark of engineering at illinois
6454174 ifoundry is a collaborative interdepartmental curriculum incubator where volunteer faculty and students from many departments will come together to plan text and execute the engineering curricula of the future
6454175 dean adesida is taking an important step toward educating the engineer of the future and we believe that other schools will examine the organizational principles embedded in the ifoundry initiative
6454176 we expected today to be about gcse results and what you then find is one of the youngsters who has worked very hard for their gcses has been the victim of this tragedy so people are very shocked and upset
6454177 ahmeds only been here a year the great achievement is he achieved 9 gcses
6454178 ive spoken to his family this morning and they are most proud of the fact that he got a c in maths and a c in science he also got two other c grades
6454179 family members came in and found out about his results but not his parents because they were too upset
6454180 the family is shocked and devastated his tutor said to me he never would have expected ahmed to be involved in this sort of incident
6454181 within the context of the school there is almost no issue to do with gangs because we try and create the hackney free community
6454182 clearly there are a lot of issues going on locally and nationally but they hardly impact on the school at all
6454183 but suddenly we have had this dreadful tragedy possibly as a result of gang activity
6454184 ive heard that he saw a gang chasing someone else and he thought they were carrying knives
6454185 apparently when he saw the knives he started to run towards the flats and the gang chased him
6454186 the victim was with a group of friends on the 13th floor of a tower block when they became concerned about another group of youths cycling towards the tower block
6454187 this caused the victim and his friends to leave the area the victim was separated from his friends
6454188 he climbed onto the outside of the tower block via an open balcony and then climbed down several floors trying to escape
6454189 he reached the seventh floor when he could no longer carry on after this point he fell to his death
6454190 the other group involved are described as black male youths some were wearing hooded tops others were wearing bandanas and were riding pedal cycles
6454191 i am appealing to anyone who witnessed the victim fall from the tower block and anyone who witnessed events prior to him fall to please contact police
6454192 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6454193 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him that is what it is like

6454207 we have known for some time that young and middle aged adults who are overweight run a higher risk of death and it was presumed that this held true for older people in fact our results show that the risk of dying is higher only for the most severely obese but that all older people who are overweight are at significantly increased risk of developing problems with mobility and carrying out everyday tasks
6454208 this research is important because a growing proportion of the population is aged 65 or over and more and more of these older people are overweight in fact in most developed countries middle aged and elderly adults are more likely to be obese than people in any other age group these findings have huge significance for the delivery of health care both now and in the future increasing numbers of older people and higher levels of overweight and obesity will lead to a greater burden of disability and ill health and place an immense strain on health and social services the issue is likely to get worse as time goes on and represents a ticking time bomb for health services around the world
6454209 staying a healthy weight can be a fun and relatively easy thing to do even as people get older
6454210 our experience of running supported walking and cycling groups has shown that older people benefit in many ways from regular physical activity
6454211 people are living longer but this study shows that excess weight can have a real impact on the quality of peoples lives which can reduce the benefit of those extra years
6454212 for centuries people appreciated only the beautiful works of art and long life of the colours but little did they realise that these works of art are also in modern language photocatalytic air purifier with nanostructured gold catalyst
6454213 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
6454214 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
6454215 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
6454216 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
6454217 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
6454218 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy
6454219 theres a loss of confidence in the american economy and part of it is because of the culture of greed and irresponsibility and at the top of that unfortunately is the president of the united states hes taken our government into terrible debt his administration has yielded to special interests over and over again halliburton writes the specs and then gets the no bid contracts in the bush administration the foxes are guarding the foxes and the middle class hens are getting plucked

6454228 i think it had more to do with some angry people that left this meeting because the epstein school expansion is coming up at a sept 16 city council meeting
6454229 i think it had more to do with some angry resident that decided that they would lash out and they put that swastika down there to make sure that it got noticed and that everybody was properly outraged
6454230 i dont think this was a focused effort to lash out at the school because it is a jewish school and i dont think it had anything to do with any of the faculty or students there
6454231 the people of this village have been wary of the cf for the past several years because they have seen units come and go and promises made that were never fulfilled
6454232 we wanted to assure them that we were different and to help prove our resolve we lived among them in their impoverished community experiencing for a short time the life they have always known
6454233 one of our main goals at this point is to put control of all future developments into the hands of the iraqi people
6454234 we want iraqi people in charge of iraqi projects using iraqi money and iraqi workers as soon as possible which will further stabilize the country and allow our forces to withdraw
6454235 no matter how big or small our ops might be we remain dedicated in our efforts to help the iraqi people gain a new life
6454236 when i talk to my family and friends back home they want to know what its really like over here and if we are truly making a difference
6454237 each time i have explained to them the kind of change they have not witnessed yet battles and lethal ops have long ago ceased to be priorities our focus now is a return to normalcy living and working and interacting with the iraqi people positive changes are happening every day they might not be big or flashy but they are making lasting improvements that have already put victory for the iraqi people within their reach
6454238 op iraqi children is a wonderful way for the people of the u s to help the children of iraq and by doing so we are helping our soldiers who are working so hard over there
6454239 the kits have been a huge hit with the local children
6454240 the kits have also given the maneuver units and police transition team a positive avenue to interact with local children with our iraqi counterparts
6454241 the refurbishments included such things as trash removal a fresh coat of paint for the classrooms and the building refurbished bathrooms new carpet a playground and equipment for the gymnasium
6454242 i felt good about this project in particular because it is the only kindergarten in our area of ops
6454243 being able to offer these young children a good start at an education is important to me
6454244 since the beginning of our squadrons ops in this area there have been complete refurbishments of 5 schools
6454245 we also have 5 ongoing projects and 8 that are being planned
6454246 the families that left now feel secure enough to move back to the area and contacted their local leadership for permission
6454247 the ia with our support decided the area is stable enough and the families pose no threat to the peace
6454248 the 1st raider brigade and isf interact daily with the iraqi citizens of the rashid district

6454256 central europe has multiple source and reservoir rocks that have potential for unconventional gas resource plays compared with north america the level of exploration activity is low and acreage is relatively inexpensive we believe central europe represents a good opportunity to apply technology and know how developed in the u s and canada to new play areas due to the high price of russian gas imports the price of gas in central europe is already in the 10 to 15 per mmbtu range and expected to go higher thus any resource plays that prove to be commercially successful are likely to have significant reserve value lo amp g consultants have extensive experience in central european basins as well as access to a large geologic database with which to perform their work
6454257 some things should not be explained not talked about just left its such an important thing for children and i see too much of their expressions theres too much shock when they meet the real people playing these parts because theyve got something living inside their heads we live in a time and culture where everything is overexplained overexamined before during and after and i think heres an opportunity because god knows it doesnt need the publicity to just leave it alone

6454262 bob is absolutely right that the customer comes first we here at globalbiz do put the customer first whenever were thinking about customer facing activities but the fact is that some of our work involves behind the scenes stuff which the customers never see and that is of little relevance to them so bob can rest easy and we can wrap this up without further worry about how this decision will affect the customer

6454293 definitely the la nina should have had an effect how much we cannot say
6454294 up to july 2008 this year has been cooler than the previous five years at least it still looks like its warmer than average
6454295 of course at the beginning of the year there was la nina and that would have had the effect of suppressing temperatures somewhat as well

6454319 they are performing much better than the enormous overall population of teens out there
6454320 this is a subjective form of sport our girls can perform but its the judges who decide furthermore as experience has shown anything can happen at the olympic games for example take athens four years ago when the russian girls were performing in the group event the music disc suddenly got stuck but they went on as if nothing had happened and won the gold since athens the team has training very hard spending up to ten hours a day in the pool weve prepared some very tricky compositions especially for the beijing games
6454321 the technical part of the program the group will perform to the music of the spanish suite by isaac albeniz the rhythm is that of a heartbeat this requires intensive work the music for the freestyle part has been especially composed for the beijing olympics its an arrangement from the soundtrack of the film pirates of the caribbean the girls act out pirates fish seaweed and the breaking of the waves but you must remember that in this sport you also have to show technique and synchronisation so in order to win you have to show both art and technology and thats not simple

6454326 should be a refuge where one can step away from political madness in search of peace church leaders need to help people develop their consciences so they can make good decisions they need to encourage public servants to be men and women of moral courage they need to urge citizens to make wise decisions they cant do any of that if they turn half of them off
6454327 there are other reasons for concern when religion and politics get too cozy
6454328 when a church leader aligns himself with partisan politics he becomes one more rancorous voice in the crowd instead of a voice of wisdom above it
6454329 church leaders are called to be all things to all people

6454417 communities of practice are formed by people who engage in a process of collective learning in a shared domain of human endeavor a tribe learning to survive a band of artists seeking new forms of expression a group of engineers working on similar problems a gathering of first time managers helping each other cope in a nutshell communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly

6454426 getting direct information is difficult so imaging how small ice crystals grow on solid surfaces is an important advance this is solid information that allows basic theories to be verified this was our goal to provide unambiguous information
6454427 typically an stm only works if the substrate is conductive
6454428 the discovery caused a rebirth of surface science and completely changed the field but until now people had not been able to apply it to ice
6454429 the fact that we can apply these same methods to ice is very exciting
6454430 because you are trying to get atomic resolution a few atoms on the apex of the tip can completely throw off the experiment
6454431 if you are not getting an image you dont know if your tip is bad or you are choosing the wrong parameters
6454432 for about a month we thought the films were not really as high as they seemed we thought the insulating quality of ice made them appear to be higher
6454433 i increased the voltage and the ice appeared to really pop out still i thought it was just the same electronic artifact
6454434 our ability to image these ice films opens the door to a multitude of exciting new experiments
6454435 human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe
6454436 the significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them
6454437 only when the last tree has died and the last river has been poisoned and the last fish has been caught will we realize we cant eat money
6454438 someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago
6454439 these findings provide further evidence that the health system is falling short of where it needs to be to ensure health and economic security
6454440 we need a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance available
6454441 what is notable is how this is spreading up the income scale
6454442 even adults with insurance reported problems in getting needed care
6454443 might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities
6454444 integrate more completely and harmonize the standards that apply to the f b i s activities
6454445 simply based on somebodys race religion or exercise of first amendment rights
6454446 this document clarifies the rules by which the f b i conducts its intelligence mission
6454447 this seems to be based on the idea that the government can take a bunch of data and create a profile that can be used to identify future bad guys
6454448 but that has not been demonstrated to be true anywhere else
6454449 not only were positive results more likely to be published but studies that were not positive in our opinion were often published in a way that conveyed a positive outcome
6454450 it tells you where they placed their bets before they saw the data
6454451 selective publication can lead doctors to make inappropriate prescribing decisions that may not be in the best interest of their patients and thus the public health
6454452 theres an expectation that if you get a positive result thats what youre supposed to do and if you get a negative result you have failed
6454453 with the proliferation of journals virtually anything can get published somewhere maybe not in the new england journal of medicine but in some third tier rag which would still count as published
6454454 irregular warfare the nonkinetic solutions some whole of government approaches but particularly looking at the notion of information dominance in the battle space and things that we can do with our interagency partners to achieve effects without necessarily totally leaning on
6454455 this is a very long term strategy that we must be engaged in and it runs the gamut from just counter terrorism to counter crime to however you want to look at it
6454456 threads of violent actors that range across the scope of terrorist actors to just international organized criminals to i think narco terrorists or drug traders and then in some cases just basic gangs thieves and thugs that can come together and represent a very formidable threat to our region for a number of reasons
6454457 these are not necessarily you know standing organized armies that wear uniforms like we all envision warfare to be
6454458 it takes a different kind of tactic in terms of countering disrupting and defeating this kind of threat
6454459 if were going to establish a security line of operation in afghanistan then obviously from that you dont necessarily get security if you cant resolve the economic and agricultural conundrum of what is the money maker well its the poppy product so a strategy has got to deal with that
6454460 what do we do the military does not necessarily do that but what can we do to establish desired strategic objectives that the interagency could step up to with maybe department of agriculture us agency for international development and state department to do that what can nato do to also help influence that
6454461 afghanistan is a different battle space than iraq so the lessons of iraq may or may not work in afghanistan
6454462 the situation is much different the people are much different the dynamics are much different so still a lot of work to be done in afghanistan
6454463 long term endeavor to engage at a strategic level to do those things across all of the many areas of need that would need to be done
6454464 a productive society that can govern and provide services to its people as well as develop a gross national product
6454465 that does not come overnight thats an institutional change that will take some time
6454466 lord if only i could have talked to hitler all of this might have been avoided
6454467 politically the significance of these dealings the great surprise is that none of it seemed to matter much over the next decade or so
6454468 a few questions would be raised but democrat averell harriman would not be stopped from becoming federal mutual security administrator in 1951 or winning election as governor of new york in 1954 nor would republican prescott bush who was elected senator from connecticut in 1952 and his presidential descendants be hurt in any of their future elections
6454469 wouldnt it be great to come up with something similar that would hold cards

6454474 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6454475 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6454476 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6454477 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6454478 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6454479 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting

6454496 they are not going to win under that arrangement they have to find some way where they start on a level playing field with every other county and if they do that and have a full team i think galway are as good as any other county out there

6454523 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6454524 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
6454525 common colds are most often caused by infection by one of the more than 100 serotypes of rhinovirus a type of picornavirus other viruses causing colds are coronavirus human parainfluenza viruses human respiratory syncytial virus adenoviruses enteroviruses or metapneumovirus due to the many different types of viruses it is not possible to gain complete immunity to the common cold
6454526 the pullback of russian forces is taking place at such a tempo that by the end of august 22 they will be in the zones of responsibility of russian peacekeepers
6454527 one would assume we would have to help them rebuild because they are a partner in the war on terror theyve been helpful they are going to ask us i am sure to replace and rebuild
6454528 we finished the record a few months ago and we just thought why wait six months to release it
6454529 i just want it to be out there really that was really the main impetus for doing it this way
6454530 it was a real dispiriting process with the second record and the first because we finished them in the summer and we had to wait six months before we released them
6454531 by the time they came out i wasnt that interested this time it all feels kind of new and im excited by the whole prospect
6454532 the goal was to make music which sounded good on the dance floor or stuff that would make people want to move as opposed to something that you want to sit down and immerse yourself in
6454533 we tried make something that was up and just tried to make some unconventional sounds rather than necessarily experiment with ideas about form
6454534 it was great working with them but we kind of felt we had unfinished business working with the pair of them
6454535 also by recording less songs you have a higher control quality because you really make sure you give each song what it needs
6454536 languages of the world this is an archive of over 1 500 human languages assembled in the year 02008 c e magnify 1 000 times to find over 13 000 pages of language documentation
6454537 this is one of the most fascinating objects on earth if we found one of these things 2 000 years ago with all the languages of the time it would be among our most priceless artifacts i feel a high responsibility for preserving it for future generations
6454538 like z it describes all structures in space and time with a minimal toolkit of mathematical notions

6454542 some wont recognize the new province but that is already true today
6454543 in my opinion we missed a golden opportunity to address the crisis at lambeth

6454670 thanks to our customers we were able to add an additional trip
6454671 i wanted to give them two exciting but different choices they can choose either the beautiful mississippi gulf coast or north georgias blue ridge mountains
6454672 georgias eight grade math crct is a test that has special importance as a gateway in the states assessment system students must either pass it or successfully appeal to their school system to be promoted to the ninth grade
6454673 the test also factors into middle schools ayp adequate yearly progress calculations under the no child left behind act
6454674 courses previously taught in grades 6 8 were extremely repetitious addressing almost the same content in all three grades expectations for students learning were not clear and in most cases demanded only low level cognitive skills
6454675 under the new gps by the time students have finished eighth grade they should have learned 80 percent of the concepts and skills previously taught in algebra 1 50 percent of the content traditionally taught in high school geometry and a significant amount of statistics and probability previously taught in high school courses
6454676 implementing the new math curriculum in the sixth seventh and eighth grades during the past three years has been a challenge for everyone so being recognized as 14th in the state for having the highest percentage of students meeting or exceeding standards on the eighth grade math crct was a huge accomplishment
6454677 this recognition proves that our teachers in the middle school implemented that new curriculum and prepared our students to exceed on the crct we especially appreciate the high standards that mrs wallace holds her students to which are evident by their performance on the crct
6454678 we are extremely proud of lcms mrs wallace and the students in the class of 2012
6454679 de dorst naar entertainment in de bric landen staat in sterk contrast met de meer volwassen amerikaanse en europese markten waar informatie en nieuws de grote steunpilaren zijn van het gebruik van mobiel internet

6454681 i enjoyed every part of this class my mind is racing with the knowledge from the advance reading i had coming into the course and even more from what i am taking away from the class experience
6454682 our partnership with mike king and youthfront represents the seminarys ability to create first class intensive course offerings for professional youth ministers as well as our on campus graduate students our goal includes innovative coursework in youth spiritual formation urban youth ministry and emerging ministry practice our mace degree allows for this flexibility but we also offer certificate and diploma programs that provide focused professional development classes like this one allow pastors a chance to break away and incorporate personal and professional renewal
6454683 i appreciated the opportunity to bring a perspective for those youth whom this campaign may overlook those coming from fractured families who now live on our streets and are at high risk to drug use
6454684 i was informed friday august 15 that the das office found no criminal activity in an allegation of felony obstruction of an officer lodged by lt david stevens of the lincoln county sheriffs office on february 22 2008
6454685 the entire event seems to be based on a misunderstanding and a rush to judgment on the part of lt stevens
6454686 the person on the other end who said she was his crites sister told the passenger josh whimbush that we had run the tag earlier
6454687 the tag was run over the phone and not broadcasted over the net the only people who had access to this information were the two female dispatchers in 911 investigator hudson bell and myself
6454688 taylor interviewed both dispatchers and listened to all of the recordings for the date and time in question we record all of the telephone and radio traffic that occurs in the 911 center taylors preliminary investigation did not support lt stevens allegation
6454689 over a period of several weeks the gbi interviewed crite whimbush and crites sister shenithia crite
6454690 all three denied knowing anyone in 911 and all three denied receiving a call from anyone prior to or after the traffic stop concerning any information about sheriffs office activities
6454691 the female who spoke to lt stevens on the phone during the traffic stop reported that she had been told by one of the men in the car that an unmarked police car had closely followed the subjects car earlier in the evening and she told lt stevens that she wondered why he didnt pull the car over then
6454692 we were tickled to death and shocked at the same time
6454693 we were all very proud of them we couldnt have asked any more of them
6454694 its still hard to believe we beat a team as good as they were
6454695 we caught fire as a team and beat them though
6454696 everybody on our team and all our fans just started jumping up and down with excitement
6454697 it was a great feeling one that i dont think will ever go away soon for any of us
6454698 our kids played as well in those two games as they have played all season as coaches we couldnt be more proud of them
6454699 just playing all those other teams and winning was exciting and fun im proud of my team
6454700 we played eight games over six days and the last two games were incredible it was a total shock the boys really came together as at team they played like theyve never played before everybody was hitting
6454701 we werent this morning when i left home but its still early yet
6454702 i see you around a lot but i hardly ever see him with you
6454703 ive put in way too much time training you why would i ever want to do all that over again
6454704 you wouldnt walk away from a successful business would you
6454705 the school is in the midst of constructing a science lab unfortunately the project is at a standstill due to a lack of funds although the cement foundation has been laid and the brick walls have been erected we do not have doors window panes iron sheets for the roof and so forth
6454706 we in mtunthama malawi thank you considerably for helping us
6454707 guerrilla tactics for getting the legal job of your dreams
6454708 all churches from our district would definitely benefit from this workshop
6454709 if wilkes county calls dipatch and needs water the dispatcher will call both myself and ernie doss lincoln county public safety director if i cannot be reached in a reasonable length of time dispatch will have access to the water system and can release the water as long as there is a sufficient amount in the tank we can also get more water from the city of lincolnton in a dire emergency
6454710 im glad to be able to assist wilkes county in this life and property saving endeavor
6454711 wilkes county has been good to work with we need to be ready to assist our neighbor in case there is a fire near the county line
6454712 all of the items were brought before either the finance committee or the public works committee a lot of time and effort was put forth by these committees prior to making recommendations to the full board
6454713 the road is currently a private road but the county uses it to access the two county wells behind mr john ludwigs house
6454714 the alternative is to spend thousands of dollars to develop the easement that the county currently has that runs through several pastures to the wells
6454715 we moved all the time and if we didnt move my friends did growing up i always envied people who lived in one place
6454716 it was not unusual for him to have a painting at the whitney museum hanging between hans hofmann who was his teacher on the one hand and franz kline who was a wonderful friend on the other
6454717 this initiative opens up possibilities for fraport as an airport operator and ground handling provider to apply its extensive know how actively and to help define standards within the framework of the cargo 2000 quality management system
6454718 i blew my mind and i blew the worlds mind
6454719 with preliminary exploration work yielding positive results we are eager to proceed to the next phase of exploration
6454720 we are currently in positive discussions with institutional investors and private accredited investors outside of the united states some of the interested parties may require the company co list on the tsx venture exchange
6454721 state laws serve the valuable purpose of exposing dangers about drugs and alerting manufacturers and regulators about issues and potential risks associated with pharmaceuticals
6454722 the outcome of this case will affect the fate of hundreds of state tort suits consumer protection actions of state attorneys general and the role of the states in our federal government
6454723 i remember my daddy taking it out of the desk and handing it to me and saying that his daddy had given it to him and his daddy had given it to him
6454724 since our family has a connection to waynesboro and early has a connection to waynesboro it just made sense that it would be here as opposed to new market

6454740 and as the problem gets worse it not only hurts more but also gets much more expensive to fix
6454741 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6454742 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6454743 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6454744 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6454745 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6454746 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6454747 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting

6454749 en los momentos de desesperanza recuerdo que en el transcurso de toda la historia la v a de la verdad y del amor siempre ha ganado

6454751 considero a jes s de nazaret uno de los mayores maestros que han existido dir a los hind es que la vida no est completa a menos que se estudien con reverencia las ense anzas de jes s
6454752 el amor es la fuerza m s humilde pero la m s poderosa de que dispone el ser humano
6454753 en cuanto alguien comprende que obedecer leyes injustas es contrario a su dignidad de hombre ninguna tiran a puede dominarle
6454754 nadie puede hacer el bien en un espacio de su vida mientras hace da o en otro la vida es un todo indivisible
6454755 entiendo por religi n no ya un conjunto de ritos y costumbres sino lo que est en el origen de todas las religiones poni ndonos cara a cara con el creador
6454756 ganamos justicia m s r pidamente si hacemos justicia a la parte contraria
6454757 humildemente me esforzar en amar en decir la verdad en ser honesto y puro en no poseer nada que no me sea necesario en ganarme el sueldo con el trabajo en estar atento siempre a lo que como y bebo en no tener nunca miedo en respetar las creencias de los dem s en buscar siempre lo mejor para todos en ser un hermano para todos mis hermanos
6454758 la alegr a est en la lucha en el esfuerzo en el sufrimiento que supone la lucha y no en la victoria misma
6454759 la causa de la libertad se convierte en una burla si el precio a pagar es la destrucci n de quienes deber an disfrutar la libertad
6454760 la fuerza no proviene de la capacidad f sica sino de la voluntad indomable
6454761 la fuerza no procede de las facultades f sicas sino de una voluntad invencible
6454762 la humanidad no puede liberarse de la violencia m s que por medio de la no violencia
6454763 la tarea que enfrentan los devotos de la no violencia es muy dif cil pero ninguna dificultad puede abatir a los hombres que tienen fe en su misi n
6454764 la verdad es el objetivo el amor el medio para llegar a ella
6454765 la verdad es totalmente interior no hay que buscarla fuera de nosotros ni querer realizarla luchando con violencia con enemigos exteriores
6454766 la verdad jam s da a a una causa que es justa
6454767 la verdadera educaci n consiste en obtener lo mejor de uno mismo qu otro libro se puede estudiar mejor que el de la humanidad
6454768 la violencia es el miedo a los ideales de los dem s
6454769 lo m s atroz de las cosas malas de la gente mala es el silencio de la gente buena
6454770 lo mismo que un rbol tiene una sola ra z y m ltiples ramas y hojas tambi n hay una sola religi n verdadera y perfecta pero diversificada en numerosas ramas por intervenci n de los hombres
6454771 lo que se obtiene con violencia solamente se puede mantener con violencia
6454772 los grilletes de oro son mucho peores que los de hierro
6454773 m s que los actos de los malos me horroriza la indiferencia de los buenos
6454774 no debemos perder la fe en la humanidad que es como el oc ano no se ensucia porque algunas de sus gotas est n sucias
6454775 no hay camino hacia la paz la paz es el camino
6454776 no me gusta la palabra tolerancia pero no encuentro otra mejor el amor empuja a tener hacia la fe de los dem s el mismo respeto que se tiene por la propia
6454777 no se nos otorgar la libertad externa m s que en la medida exacta en que hayamos sabido en un momento determinado desarrollar nuestra libertad interna
6454778 nuestra recompensa se encuentra en el esfuerzo y no en el resultado un esfuerzo total es una victoria completa
6454779 odio todo lo que sea privilegio y monopolio considero como tab todo lo que no puede ser compartido por la multitud
6454780 primero te ignoran despu s se r en de ti luego te atacan entonces ganas
6454781 puesto que yo soy imperfecto y necesito la tolerancia y la bondad de los dem s tambi n he de tolerar los defectos del mundo hasta que pueda encontrar el secreto que me permita ponerles remedio
6454782 todo derecho que no lleva consigo un deber no merece que se luche por defenderlo
6454783 todo lo que se come sin necesidad se roba al est mago de los pobres
6454784 un error no se convierte en verdad por el hecho de que todo el mundo crea en l
6454785 un pa s una civilizaci n se puede juzgar por la forma en que trata a sus animales
6454786 uno debe ser tan humilde como el polvo para poder descubrir la verdad
6454787 vive m s sencillamente para que otros puedan sencillamente vivir
6454788 estoy convencido de que si los esfuerzos por divorciar la pol tica de la religi n no se hubiesen hecho como se hicieron la pol tica no habr a degenerado como con frecuencia ocurre he conocido a muchos hombres religiosos que eran pol ticos disfrazados yo mismo que tengo la apariencia de pol tico soy de coraz n un hombre religioso
6454789 con mis escasos conocimientos de mi propia religi n no quiero pertenecer a ninguna instituci n religiosa
6454790 se puede confiar en las promesas de la gente sobre cualquier cosa salvo si se trata de dinero
6454791 siempre ha sido un misterio para m c mo puede haber hombres que se sientan honrados con la humillaci n de sus semejantes
6454792 mi lucha no es simplemente pol tica es religiosa tambi n y por lo tanto completamente pura no importa mucho si uno en ella muere o vive espero que t tambi n opinar s de la misma manera y que no te sentir s desgraciada
6454793 la no violencia ha de ser la nica bandera de combate entre los ej rcitos humanos ella prevalecer
6454794 es un gran hombre es el hombre m s grande del mundo
6454795 desde entonces las us muchos veranos aun cuando yo pueda creer que no soy digno de calzar las sandalias de un hombre como l
6454796 pasaba horas estudiando la biblia y la vida de cristo en particular le gustaba la filosof a expuesta por cristo en el serm n del monte ten a muchos amigos cristianos al pregunt rsele por qu no se convert a al cristianismo respondi cuando usted me convenza de que los cristianos viven conforme a las ense anzas de cristo ser el primero en convertirme

6454802 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can

6454807 the search has just begun to establish the right weight in all of our wine packaging
6454808 according to extensive market research the lighter wine bottles retain the essential packaging functionality and do not affect brand integrity which makes for a winning situation when it comes to environmental concerns and wine packaging less is definitely more
6454809 how can she be so full of self confidence even though shes a newcomer
6454810 i have to act and say things upon my own emotions
6454811 but it doesnt have to be like that its ok to say things that are more humane

6454813 i dont understand young people nowadays anyway so ill leave it to ayaya and nino you can change the lines too just play the roles the way you want and teach me how kids nowadays think

6454821 courage the determination not to be overwhelmed by any object however frightful enables us to stand up to any fear
6454822 courage and cowardice are antithetical courage is an inner resolution to go forward in spite of obstacles and frightening situations cowardice is a submissive surrender to circumstance courage breeds creative self affirmation cowardice produces destructive self abnegation courage faces fear and thereby masters it cowardice represses fear and is thereby mastered by it courageous men never lose their zest for living even though their life situation is zestless cowardly men overwhelmed by the uncertainties of life lose the will to live we must constantly build dykes of courage to hold back the flood of fear
6454823 to have an ordinance on hiring like this is silly if people think the meat of the problem is at hormel and fremont beef which are outside the city limits
6454824 enforcement with any part of this is going to be nearly impossible to do quite frankly its not up to the city of fremont to solve this issue
6454825 we are very excited to see how angela will enhance our current link building department as a whole she brings a great deal of knowledge to our company and i look forward to seeing the innovative strategies she creates while working with our other highly qualified link acquisition team members

6454828 we want to educate our community about the realities of our people and the services we offer its critical to the health of our community that everyone realize who we are
6454829 we are advocates for proper sexual education which we agree begins at home we offer assistance to those who may not have access to health services millions take for granted like simple ob gyn services we want to reduce teen pregnancy stis and abortion rates we agree on much more than folks may think but unfortunately we have been defined and maligned by our detractors thus the campaign
6454830 there was and has been entirely too much talk and sadly little listening on both sides of this discussion
6454831 the rhetoric only serves to further polarize when in reality there is significant common ground and planned parenthood has been characterized in a largely false and negative light for far too long the campaign is designed to share that there is common ground but most importantly that planned parenthood is a valued member of this community and is willing to listen and confront these tough important issues head on
6454832 its a devastating shock and were working hard to try to find a way round it
6454833 can we start the season i really dont know at this stage
6454834 it doesnt matter really what my definition of rich is
6454835 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
6454836 some people are wealthy and rich in their lives and their children and their ability to educate them others are poor if theyre billionaires
6454837 i dont have any need to show that im different than president bush
6454838 and flatly stated that he wouldnt do anything as president to underscore his difference with the unpopular incumbent
6454839 we want to extend our heartfelt condolences to the pretorius family we realise that your most precious possession was taken away due to our childs deeds we are truly sorry and wish that these were not the circumstances and that we could change them

6454856 im pretty much a fan that if youve been trained and you are registered then you should be able to carry a weapon matter of fact theres a lot of instances that would have saved a lot of lives
6454857 for the pacific islands forum to declare an unequivocal condemnation of bainimarama is itself unprecedented
6454858 no doubt this is upsetting for those of us who live downstream for farmers and communities who are struggling with low water allocations
6454859 if it rains they capture the water if it goes past they call them ring tanks
6454860 i was talking to a person last night who said its fantastic weve been sailing on our ring tank
6454861 that was pretty much ordinary to be flying after that
6454862 i directed the water bombing helicopters i would sit in a helicopter above them talking with ground crews and they would say where they needed it
6454863 the fires are pretty much contained but they only need a couple of days of bad weather and it could take off again
6454864 what we do this side of the world is pretty much similar to what they do we probably do our briefings a little better the feedback was the way we went about briefing them in the morning was good
6454865 many of them get a very basic briefing and dont get a lot of information

6454912 in large measure we deliberately limit the production until we install our own born and bred final transmission by mid september at which time production will start to ramp up leading toward a monthly rate of over 100 cars in december
6454913 id be remiss in not acknowledging that all of us at qantas are disappointed at the number of recent incidents and we do not step away from the fact that the incident on qf30 in manila was very serious

6454915 we are currently involved internationally in a 1 5 million program just in the last 12 months collaborating with international researchers

6454917 so theres not a lot there to go on in terms of the natural progression of the disease
6454918 only people whove had close relationships with horses have been sick or have died
6454919 our results show that hot flushes night sweats sleeplessness and joint pains were less common in women on hrt in this age group sexuality was also improved
6454920 even when women did not have hot flushes and were well past menopause there was a noted improvement in sleep sexuality and joint pains
6454921 while this study shows some short term benefits it did not show overall improvements in overall quality of life or depression
6454922 i have a number of patients who developed their cancers because of smoking or prior smoking
6454923 anything to reduce the disease burden related to tobacco is greatly encouraged
6454924 passive smoking is bad for your health and babies and children are breathing in almost as much as the smoker is
6454925 we all know the consequences of prolonged exposure all three go together to have an effect on the child and babys health

6454928 really is this what the ratepayers are paying mr rocchiccioli thousands and thousands of dollars for
6454929 out of the next two months we should start producing some gold and ramp up production by the last three months of the year
6454930 there will be a gradual increase in production with a major announcement of development and people will be very pleased with having a significant gold producing mine in ballarat
6454931 ballarat goldfields will become a major employer in the town and will be a major source of economic activity
6454932 the market is a bit dubious about ballarat and the victorian goldfields because of past disappointments of other operating mines but were very confident ballarat is going to be a comfortable investment
6454933 ballarat will be different to other gold mines in australia because its a residential line the workforce is part of the community and a lot of the jobs are generated in ballarat

6454986 if the current funding environment remains as it is and the rba cuts the likelihood is well be passing on the benefit to home borrowers
6454987 the banks cost of funds is far greater than the reserve bank cash rate however we will still pass on the full benefit of the official interest rate cut

6455043 it is just looking across the whole spectrum and seeing where you can save a few bucks it all adds up

6455058 mind you plants cant run away from bugs and other pests they need to deal with them one of the things they do is to release volatile substances into the air so as to attract predators of the bugs
6455059 genetic engineering modification gm of green leaf volatile production holds significant potential towards formulating environmentally friendly pest control strategies it also has important implications for manipulating food flavour
6455060 for example the aroma of virgin olive oil stems from the volatiles synthesized by olives by modifying the activity of enzymes that generate these substances it may be possible to alter the flavour of the resulting oils
6455061 our work shows how you can convert one enzyme to another and more importantly provides the needed information for modifying the glv production in plants

6455071 there are five ways that the hydrogen can be stored on the vehicle as a high pressure gas as a very low temperature liquid chemically bound or physically absorbed onto a material such as a solid hydride as a component of a liquid hydrocarbon fuel which is reformed or as a component of water h20 which is hydrolyzed
6455072 the most abundant source of hydrogen on earth is water every molecule of water contains one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms it is relatively simple to separate the hydrogen in water from the oxygen using electricity to run an electrolyzer an electrolyzer is a galvanic cell composed of an anode and a cathode submerged in a water based electrolyte in many ways the operation of an electrolyzer is the opposite of operating a hydrogen fuel cell in a fuel cell hydrogen and oxygen are supplied to the anode and the cathode and they combine to form water while creating an electrical current that can be put to use see section 1 2 1 and appendix a in an electrolyzer an electrical current is applied between the anode and the cathode which causes the water in the electrolyte to break down releasing oxygen gas at the anode and hydrogen gas at the cathode see figure 12
6455073 onboard electrolyzers are used with hydrogen injection systems for diesel engines see section 3 5 in this case only a small amount of hydrogen and oxygen are produced to supplement not replace the diesel fuel used in the engine the electricity to operate the electrolyzer is typically supplied by the engines alternator or 12 24 vdc electrical system
6455074 a hydrogen injection system for a diesel engine produces and uses significantly less hydrogen than a hydrogen fuel cell or hydrogen ice and does not require that compressed or liquid hydrogen be carried on the vehicle the system is designed to produce hydrogen only when required in response to driver throttle commands when the system is shut off no hydrogen should be present on the vehicle
6455075 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

6455080 there has been a constant military campaign that clearly is very difficult to achieve largely because the region is mountainous and the local population is either indifferent or sympathetic to the extremists
6455081 the algerian authorities are facing a major problem in terms of conceiving a way of dealing with this
6455082 the government is not openly dictatorial but it is incompetent and unresponsive
6455083 unflinchingly fight terrorism with a strong determination until its total elimination in our country
6455084 at the same time algeria will not deviate from the path of national reconciliation which has already given major progress in the consolidation of security across the national territory
6455085 the armed groups no longer have the ability overturn power by force and install the islamic republic for which they are fighting and killing citizens
6455086 but they are poisoning the lives of algerians considerably clouding its reputation abroad and weakening the states capacity in international negotiations

6455114 youd think wed be having a serious debate but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with is that really what this election is about is that what is worthy of the american people
6455115 i would go another month without mentioning obamas name the bigness in john mccain is his best quality this election is ideally suited to him he won the nomination because he was the right republican at the right time he is the one guy who will take on spending and mean it he should honor obama as the first african american nominee not attack him except on policy differences
6455116 hell get to the ton this week and good on him

6455133 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6455134 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6455135 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6455136 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6455137 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6455138 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely

6455141 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

6455146 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6455147 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother

6455155 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

6455281 the u s consumer is not in a position to add to the inflationary pressures we are seeing in the wholesale numbers so we would expect the fed to allow inflation to go untended relying on deflation in many quarters to dampen it we expect the fed to nurse already fragile growth instead

6455309 database archiving often fails to get the attention it needs compared to other critical activities related to production databases and data warehouses
6455310 an archival system becomes critical when you need to access archived information in response to a legal summons customer service issue security investigation or technical issue the value of archiving grows considerably as it becomes easier to access the archived data
6455311 with legal demands for access growing conventional approaches to database archiving are increasingly being found lacking they focus on lifting and shifting inactive data from production databases to improve application performance without considering how to optimize the way archived data is stored get your archiving right and you reduce storage costs and guarantee simple future proofed access get it wrong and at worst you could face prison
6455312 why database archiving should be part of your dbms strategy
6455313 it managers need to achieve a balance between the compliance demands for retention and the business demand for economical storage and retrieval current database management system technology is optimised for transactional processing data warehouses are optimised for analytics but both fail to adequately address archiving needs worse still the lines between archive stores and backup which have very different drivers and requirements are all too often blurred
6455314 forresters research clearly illustrates the need for the new generation of archive stores these deliver both massive reductions in storage footprints through data compression together with the security immutability and point in time query capability that enables quick simple and unimpeachable fulfilment of regulatory obligations

6455505 we as the sadr movement denounce this dubious visit and such timing we reaffirm our stance of rejecting the long term agreement we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible
6455506 you want people to think well of you dont you
6455507 testosterone might be partly responsible for shaping width to height ratio and we know that testosterone is linked to aggressive behaviour in men so there might be some kind of influence in both puberty and facial structures
6455508 we divided the width by the height and thats how we got our ratio
6455509 in the questionnaire men had a larger facial width to height ratio higher scores of trait dominance and were more reactively aggressive compared with women
6455510 individual differences in the facial width to height ratio predicted reactive aggression in men but not in women
6455511 individual differences in the facial width to height ratio were positively related to aggressive behaviour as measured by the number of penalty minutes per game obtained over a season
6455512 together these findings suggest that the sexually dimorphic facial width to height ratio may be an honest signal of propensity for aggressive behaviour

6455526 the polls show 25 percent of her supporters have not gotten on board
6455527 hes got to be very concerned by the neck in neck polls and by what happened at saddleback
6455528 over the last week weve seen sen obamas lead in the poll of polls cut in half
6455529 this change was likely driven by a renewed focus on foreign policy after russias invasion of georgia as well as by sen mccains willingness to launch more aggressive attacks against obama on issues such as off shore drilling
6455530 since obama returned from his overseas trip it seems like mccain has thrown all the punches clearly the blows have landed in recent days obama is fighting back going after mccain on the economy the issue voters care about most mccain has changed the dynamic of the race heading into the two conventions that puts more pressure on obama to go to denver and effectively define himself and mccain
6455531 speaking to a cuban american audience in miami in august 2007 he said
6455532 we do have to crack down on those employers that are taking advantage of the situation
6455533 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6455534 one of the nicest places in the world to live in
6455535 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
6455536 no i didnt no no sometimes im given to a little hyperbole
6455537 yesterday he obama suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so
6455538 we can do that decrease our dependence as a nation we can turned out sic the lights five minutes earlier we dont have to drive the extra block
6455539 im proud of that record from fighting for the recognition of doctor martin luther kings birthday in my state to sponsoring specific legislation that would prevent discrimination
6455540 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6455541 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
6455542 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
6455543 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6455544 iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose any serious threat to us
6455545 if that strategy made sense and would lead ultimately to the pullout of u s troops but in the short term required additional troop strength to protect those who are already on the ground then thats something i would support
6455546 given the situation on the ground i think if we had our troops out in four years that would be an extraordinary accomplishment
6455547 well obviously its going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues and jerusalem will be part of those negotiations
6455548 what the world should interpret is my consistent position which is i believe in trade
6455549 i just want to make sure that the rules of the road apply to everybody and they are fair and that they reflect the interests of workers and not just corporate profits
6455550 i said well i would always reserve the right to go in and strike against al qaeda if they were in iraq so ya know this is how politics works mccain thought that he could make a clever point by saying well let me give you some news barack al qaeda is in iraq like i wasnt reading the papers like i like i didnt know what was going on
6455551 well first of all i do know that al qaeda is in iraq thats why ive said we should continue to strike al qaeda targets but i have some news for john mccain and that is that there was no such thing as al qaeda in iraq until george bush and john mccain decided to invade iraq
6455552 i intend to bring it to an end so that we can actually start going after al qaeda in afghanistan and in the hills of pakistan like we should have been doing in the first place thats the news john mccain
6455553 when we talked back in november of 04 after your election i said theres been enormous speculation about your political future
6455554 i will serve out my full six year term you know tim if you get asked enough sooner or later you get weary and you start looking for new ways of saying things but my thinking has not changed
6455555 so you will not run for president or vice president in 2008
6455556 i happen to be a proponent of single payer universal healthcare coverage thats what id like to see
6455557 i never said that we should try to go ahead and get single payer healthcare
6455558 he gets an asterisk that says he is trying to be different but overall the same wealthy interests are funding his campaign as are funding other candidates whether or not they are lobbyists
6455559 a ccording to the center for responsive politics 14 of obamas top 20 contributors employed lobbyists this year spending a total of 16 2 million to influence the federal government in the first six months of 2007
6455560 contrary to the claims of some i have no interest in sitting down with our adversaries just for the sake of talking but as president of the united states i would be willing to lead tough and principled diplomacy with the appropriate iranian leaders at a time and place of my choosing if and only if it can advance the interests of the united states
6455561 w ould you be willing to meet separately without precondition during the first year of your administration in washington or anywhere else with the leaders of iran syria venezuela cuba and north korea in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries
6455562 i would and the reason is this that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration is ridiculous
6455563 senator youve said before that youd meet with president ahmadinejad
6455564 yeah nothings changed with respect to my belief that strong countries and strong presidents talk to their enemies and talk to their adversaries i find many of president ahmadinejads statements odious and ive said that repeatedly and i think that we have to recognize that there are a lot of rogue nations in the world that dont have american interests at heart but what i also believe is that as john f kennedy said we should never negotiate out of fear but we should never fear to negotiate
6455565 sen obamas nod to lowering corporate taxes comes as republicans have been attacking him for proposals that would raise the cost of doing business such as his pledge to raise the tax rate on capital gains and his vow to increase the top income tax rates which are often used by small unincorporated enterprises he didnt say how deeply he would cut the rate but said it could be trimmed in return for reducing corporate tax breaks simplifying the tax system
6455566 one other issue thats of great importance here in the district as well is gun control you said in idaho recently im quoting here i have no intention of taking away folks guns but you support the d c handgun ban
6455567 barack obama aligned himself with welfare reform on monday launching a television ad which touts the way the overhaul slashed the rolls by 80 percent obama leaves out however that he was against the 1996 federal legislation which precipitated the caseload reduction
6455568 i dont think that we can take nuclear power off the table
6455569 sen barack obama msnbc democrat presidential candidate debate hanover nh 9 26 07
6455570 sen barack obama remarks at town hall event newton ia 12 30 07
6455571 under this compromise legislation an important tool in the fight against terrorism will continue it does however grant retroactive immunity and i will work in the senate to remove this provision so that we can seek full accountability for past offenses so i support the compromise but do so with a firm pledge that as president i will carefully monitor the program review the report by the inspectors general and work with the congress to take any additional steps i deem necessary to protect the lives and the liberty of the american people
6455572 senator whats your reaction to the supreme courts decision today striking down the death penalty for a child rapist
6455573 i disagree with the decision i have said repeatedly that i think that the death penalty should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes i think that the rape of a small child 6 or 8 years old is a heinous crime and if a state makes a decision that under narrow limited well defined circumstances the death penalty is at least potentially applicable that that does not violate our constitution now i think its you know had the supreme court said we want to constrain the ability of the states to do this to make sure that its done in a careful and appropriate way that would have been one thi ng but it basically had a blanket prohibition and i disagreed with that decision
6455574 i am happy to have a debate with john mccain and george bush about foreign policy if john mccain wants to meet me anywhere anytime to have a debate about our respective policies in iraq iran the middle east or around the world that is a conversation i am happy to have because i believe that there is no separation between john mccain and george bush when it comes to our middle east policy and i think their policy has failed
6455575 sen obama has looked at this issue he recognizes that americans are suffering that we have a unique situation with rising gas prices and this is one occasion where we need to look at this strategically and
6455576 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
6455577 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
6455578 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
6455579 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6455580 if weve got a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like then obviously thats something that i would consider because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
6455581 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
6455582 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6455583 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6455584 our findings suggest that people can make accurate inferences about others personality traits and behavioural dispositions based on certain signals conveyed by the face
6455585 the facial structure of a man provides an indication of how aggressive he will be in a competitive situation so we are able to predict with some accuracy the behaviour of men on the basis of their facial features
6455586 i get a phone call its jeremy dawson we need you is what he tells me
6455587 i feel that after 8 years and 13 reports its time for the government to finally admit that it comprehensively failed to regulate equitable life properly and to start talking compensation
6455588 it is critical that the government now sets out a credible transparent and independent process to enter into a dialogue with policy holders over compensation
6455589 i would hope that everyone in bath who has lost money through equitable life contact me so that we can put more pressure on the government to pay out this compensation

6455599 the correct answer is at least four located in arizona california and virginia according to his staff newsweek estimated this summer that the couple owns at least seven properties
6455600 the correct answer mccains staff told politico is at least four located in arizona california and virginia newsweek estimated this summer that the potential first couple owns at least seven properties
6455601 property records show that cindy mccains trust recently bought a condo at the residences at 2211 camelback for 4 66 million
6455602 the deal was actually for two condos that could be combined to one space of 6 000 to 7 000 square feet that is plenty of elbow room even for a high end condo in a region where the typical single family home runs about 1 600 square feet

6455638 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
6455639 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

6455643 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
6455644 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
6455645 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
6455646 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
6455647 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
6455648 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
6455649 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
6455650 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
6455651 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
6455652 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
6455653 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered

6455733 the deal with siemens further casts doubt on the moral fibre of the yar aduas administration coming at a time there are reports of probe of julius berger in germany for alleged acts of corruption in its footing of frequent medical trips of president yar adua to germany
6455734 there is no way the yar adua presidency can convince right thinking people that this siemens deal is not borne out of moral compromise
6455735 it is rather and that while the nation is still waiting for what the house of representatives would do with the report of the ndudi elumelu committee on power probe which indicted former president olusegun obasanjo governor segun agagu former governor liyel imoke and others president yar adua has entered into another phoney deal that may go the way of the squandered 16 billion of obasanjos era

6455816 quite conservative in its projections of obesity prevalence and estimates of attributable fractions for conditions associated with obesity diabetes cardiovascular disease various types of cancer and osteoarthritis
6455817 these new figures are tragic and frightening and represent a wake up call for the nation

6455819 we know that obesity and type two diabetes can be prevented and we need to make fundamental changes in the way we live to arrest the escalating crisis
6455820 at the end of the day it comes down to that feeling that youve got to give somebody the nod and let him roll
6455821 and were both kind of feeling that its kellens time to go
6455822 a gut feeling between myself and coach harsin and the rest of the offensive coaches really our whole staff we felt this is the guy we want to pull the trigger with let him go and get some more reps and get ready to play
6455823 there are a lot of instinctual things he possesses that are very very hard to coach
6455824 in fact i dont think you can coach them in terms of seeing the field which hes got a great knack for thats really the bottom line
6455825 hes certainly different than any of the young guys ive been around in terms of how far along he is mentally in the whole scheme of things
6455826 i cant wait to watch him play because hes got a tremendous feel for the game you can coach guys up and really teach them reads and where to go with the ball but things change very fast out there on the field and lot of that comes down to instinct and quick decisions that are hard to teach in fact you cant teach them thats where we think he excels
6455827 but you can really tell that being around his dad moores skill were developed earlier and honed earlier and now hes reaping the benefits of it
6455828 since i was little ive been around high school practices with my dad
6455829 ive prided myself on being as prepared as i can possibly be and ready for whatever situation comes to me
6455830 we wanted it to play out and just get feel for the final decision at the end because we knew it was going to be close
6455831 thats what happened when it was all said and done kellen was guy we were feeling strong about we feel that kellen gives us the best chance to win right now well play a freshman well play a senior whoever we think we can win with right now thats the guy were going with
6455832 its kind of a bittersweet day because we feel awesome about kellen
6455833 but thats a hard thing to tell somebody who has been here for five years has done everything we have asked has been a tremendous ambassador for our football program and this university has gotten better every year including this year and to have that conversation was tough hes a first class guy hes going to help us anyway he can we will need bush to win without question
6455834 im pretty excited about the opportunity and very thankful that the coachers have confidence in me
6455835 i feel im ready to take over and follow the long tradition of outstanding quarterbacks at this school great quarterbacks like bart hendricks ryan dinwiddie
6455836 you look at production and he was probably the most productive quarterback in the history of washington high school football
6455837 and then you figure in the intangibles that go with it we saw those things in kellen when we were recruiting him
6455838 i have no doubt over the last eight weeks given some of the media articles we have suffered brand damage
6455839 that people read something and say this but a few days later they say well we understand that qantas has a great reputation
6455840 theres a perception now being created of a lot more problems with qantas than there is in reality
6455841 we undergo as an airline close to 150 audits a year
6455842 i reckon most people would probably choose to stay here
6455843 it is my observation that australians are increasingly likely to say they dont care who does what so long as things get done
6455844 my natural disposition as is ours as an opposition as the liberal and national parties is to reasonably support anything that we think is going to reduce the human and social harm associated with the use of drugs and certainly the abuse of alcohol but having examined the evidence that led to this particular budget initiative we have made a decision that we willnot be supporting the excise increase that will raise around 3billion over the next five years
6455845 continuing to develop renewable energy is a key component of president bushs strategy to reduce americas dependence on foreign oil
6455846 this meeting is an opportunity for business owners citizens and agricultural producers to discuss the best ways to harness the untapped renewable energy resources in rural areas
6455847 today were taking a step that will really kick alternative energy production into high gear in the big apple its a request for expressions of interest thats going out to firms with strong track records in producing renewable energy we want their best ideas for creating both small and large scale projects serving new yorkers such projects might for example be designed to draw power from the tides of the hudson and east rivers something were already doing on a pilot basis they might call for dramatically increasing rooftop solar power production which weve estimated could meet nearly 20 per cent of the citys need for electricity they could tap into geothermal energy in fact some private home and building owners have already drilled their own heat wells or perhaps companies will want to put windfarms atop our bridges and skyscrapers or use the enormous potential of powerful off shore winds miles out in the atlantic ocean where turbines could generate roughly twice the energy that land based windfarms can windfarms located far off our shores some evidence shows could meet 10 percent of our citys electricity needs within a decade
6455848 i have absolutely no idea whether that makes any sense from a scientific from a practical point of view are you going to put a big windmill on top of the empire state building i think thats very unlikely can you put windmills off the coastline that is highly likely
6455849 the town is under my protection leave before you get a demonstration of what that means
6455850 if there is any oppressed minority homosexual religious muslim whatever it is that is the most absurd question that people do ask can you try not to be who you are and so we felt it was very important to show this whole absurd side
6455851 it can only happen at marvel as wolverine comes closer to unlocking the dark secrets of his past an afghan muslim mutant joins the x men you want daring you want different then meet dust as new x men challenges the rules again
6455852 its true i dont know what im doing with my life
6455853 yeah i drive naked through the park and run the stop sign in the dark
6455854 yeah whatever and speaking of things we dont understand is that outfit youre wearing actually a burqa
6455855 no the burqa is about modesty there are boys and men on campus and it is not right for me to show off by exposing myself or flesh to them
6455856 no i do not judge the way you dress i only ask that you do the same for me
6455857 you do judge me i dont need to be lectured by someone whos setting women back fifty years just by walking around like that
6455858 especially when the veils sets off their kohl enhanced eyes
6455859 dust is following the same script t he orient is exoticized and feminized the better to make it an alluring prize to be dominated by conquering white male imperialists
6455860 there are many practical issues that need to be resolved before we can use hydrogen as fuel how to make it how to transport it how to create the infrastructure for people to fill their cars with it
6455861 neither myself nor managing director alistair mackintosh have recently been contacted by any club regarding jimmy bullard
6455862 the only club i know that have made any contact at least with myself was wigan maybe five weeks ago
6455863 i find it strange that jimmy is being linked with moves in the press when no clubs are making offers for him
6455864 it bothers me whats going on behind the scenes here because certainly we arent receiving any bids
6455865 jimmy has told me hes happy to get his head down and stay so i dont understand whats going on
6455866 leaves too much scope for uncertainty for business to continue to invest in existing and new facilities
6455867 will be unlikely to invest while such outcomes are possible
6455868 we must do all it takes to prevent this scenario from being developed in cases with other frozen conflicts we all must proclaim that we would not accept military scenario of such conflicts resolution
6455869 the peacekeeping formula that had been working before has proven its ineffectiveness
6455870 there is a risk that sooner or later these mechanisms transform into regional conflicts therefore i will support eus position to search for new mechanisms of frozen conflicts settlement
6455871 romanias position on granting map to ukraine and georgia is the same as nato had put it at bucharest summit and at foreign ministers meeting both countries have to be accepted to the mechanism of joining nato when they are ready to that
6455872 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
6455873 theres always room for improvement in everything we do and anyone who doesnt say that is not being honest
6455874 i would never give us 10 out of 10 because we always have to strive to do better the world we are operating in is changing so fast that frankly what you were good at a year ago could be less relevant than what you should be good at today or in a years time
6455875 like many agency networks we have roster relationships with a number of global clients
6455876 so id like to grow those relationships with existing international clients and expand the work we are doing for them
6455877 in many markets and regions we have seen the responsibility for appointing media agencies moving increasingly away from marketing and more towards purchasing and procurement teams
6455878 and the issue this raises for us and eventually clients is to make sure we as an industry dont become commoditized
6455879 inevitably we will face increasing pressure from our clients on our ability to deliver more for less and we have to be very cognizant of that
6455880 one of the things im immediately seeing is that the availability of talent differs dramatically depending on the markets youre in
6455881 coming from a u k background which is quite well developed in terms of media talent resource and technology i have probably been a bit spoiled and the talent level is not the same in many other markets i wouldnt want that to come over in any kind of demeaning way its just the reality of the structures

6455890 the report is not true i tell you many people will go to hell for telling lies against the police why must the police kill him instead of people to help us apprehend the killers they are turning against us i want to state that the man was killed by fleeing gunmen during argument that ensued between them the husband and wife who were earlier abducted by the robbers were present during the incident they have spoken on the incident
6455891 this is a burden something all of us leaders must shoulder nigerian cannot even rely on the state for protection of lives and property we have lost yet another life to assassins who seem to be outnumbering our security agencies
6455892 went to the police station and would soon be back
6455893 that part of the account touched me for the four year old boy daddy was safe after all we teach our kids that police is your friend
6455894 i was approached by several people that said i thought they got an 8 increase over last year and i said they have says tax assessor jeff taylor
6455895 the law says youre supposed to adjust millages back to where youre not taking in any more money than you did last year
6455896 theyre getting 563 000 more than they got last year for the same bond
6455897 we have to know whats coming in expect that to be at 10 mills projecting 10 mills

6455900 it would be my assessment that by and large the folk what are bloggers are gentle folk who might also occupy a specific cleavage within society
6455901 this would be apparent to me as a cleavage with um not so many years of worldly experience under their belts as perhaps i might have for instance
6455902 subsequently i find a certain perspective or authority is sometimes missing from many posts sure they may have academic rigour but they can fail to be balanced against a variety of disciplines or worse still are balanced against a paucity of real world first hand experience
6455903 thats what i find frustrating in the blogosphere too theoretical little of no memory little demonstrated experience plenty of self righteousness though
6455904 less ill informed opinion and more questions and critical analysis
6455905 are read largely by people with similar views and there is little acknowledgment that such views arecontestable

6455907 the biggest problem with the packers now is their lack of experience they only have one start between their three quarterbacks i mean thats ridiculous
6455908 the biggest problem with the packers is still their lack of experience there are only 16 career starts between all three of their quarterbacks
6455909 the biggest problem with the packers now is that none of the three quarterbacks on the roster have started a playoff game how ridiculous is that

6456212 he came down from the north with a party in his head and an idea for a fireworks display claimed that hed be ready with a steel blue machete and half a rack of boundry bay each day rolled up to a room above a sweatshop store playing nothing there but lonliness and thought hed put a spell on some poor little northwest girl could it stay like that for twenty seven years now some say hes doing the obituary mambo and some say that hes hanging on the wall perhaps this yarn is the only thing some say that he was never here at all some say they saw him on western highway driving alone in some car going by and if you think that you can tell a bigger tale i swear to god youd have to tell a lie
6456213 you do too have it otherwise why would it be advertised right on your specials board if youll just take the time to look youll see it sure enough just under the rum drink thingy i was telling you about before
6456214 i was supposed to go to the opera with this other egbert whos been hounding me recently id much rather go to a hockey game with you though
6456215 when you left the message about the hockey thing i just blew him off making like i had a previous commitment i had forgotten about it worked out perfectly plus unless things have changed from a few nights ago you cant order beers at the opera
6456216 oh his names not really egbert thats merely the class of guy he is really just this harmless kid who thought he could impress a girl by producing a couple opera tickets i guess he couldnt have known that ive probably seen sweeney todd fifteen times but on top of that im over spending my time with guys like him anyway seriously i am ive realized lately that they dont really actually appreciate the things we do together but just go along and pretend so they can be seen with me what do i get out of that and im ready for a real night out hey lets split the barrio tostada for an appetizer doesnt that sound good where is that ditzy waitress
6456217 how restaurants always go to the trouble to put two kinds of wine glasses at every place setting on every single night when it doesnt seem like all that many people even order wine then the servers have to take them away time after time and the bussers have to polish them up and reset them so then you have all these people carrying glasses back and forth around the room when food is taking forever in the meantime and real service is suffering it seems like it would be so much easier to just bring the glasses at that time when somebody actually orders some vino especially since it comes in a whole new glass from the bar half the time anyway i actually just meant to order one glass of this blanc here but that mensa chick must have thought i pointed to the whole bottle oh well skal za vashe zdorovye or salud if you prefer
6456218 probably because the mark up on alcohol is one of the main ways that restaurants turn a profit
6456219 im pretty sure you can buy a six pack of blue paddle for what they are charging us for this one 12 ounce bottle which isnt what i wanted by the way since its much better on tap i would bet also that you could get something comparable to this sav blanc at trader joes for about one tenth of what itll end up showing up for on the bill
6456220 i cant really drink a sauvignon blanc to accompany a dish made with a chardonnay cream can i
6456221 that probably does defy some rule or other we could split a shiraz or something i suppose probably not what the sommelier would recommend to accompany a white linguini but im not sure they have a sommelier here anyway our waitress certainly doesnt qualify
6456222 i say have your sommelier deliver us your finest shibotz
6456223 im not sure it would ever have occurred to me that youd be such a hockey fan it was sort of a shot in the dark when i asked you to go
6456224 and as a matter of fact definitely a cut above the level of skating we can expect to see from your boys tonight that is if we actually even end up going
6456225 well i dont know take a gander at your watch for one thing
6456226 we can probably still see the puck drop for the second period
6456227 if you want to hurry on over to the arena that is
6456228 or we might be able to find something else to do
6456229 john doe right are they still alive why are you asking about them all of a sudden
6456230 what say we blow this tired joint and join this freaky parade heading over to the rialto weve got some time yet before they come on maybe we can stop at this little underground bar i know about
6456231 its dark and quiet in there and more conducive to getting better acquainted and then we can head up to rialto and slam dance the night away just wait til you see this exene chick youre gonna love her even though shes old
6456232 i guess what i like do is what im like doing right now just hanging out with certain people
6456233 and you always seemed like someone i might like to hang out with from a distance at least
6456234 so when you called with those concert tickets well here i am
6456235 and you could tell this even though weve never really hung out before
6456236 it does all seem sort of familiar though doesnt it
6456237 thats what ive always thought about you familiar since the first time i saw you across the party that day i felt like i was back in
6456238 just at the end of this lane is that bar i was talking about were going to need to get a shot of red eye in a dirty glass or something before the show starts x is the type of band that requires it
6456239 dont you think we should run over and maybe make sure we can get some x tickets before we go and get all distracted again
6456240 tickets i need more tickets i wont be comfortable until i have secured us tickets to every last event going on in this town tonight
6456241 calm down well go get some more tickets in a minute
6456242 but we might as well head into this place and have a drink since were here
6456243 so what if we get distracted anyway and hey would you look at this someone has gone and put opera tickets in your pocket what else do you have down in there eggy
6456244 i bet we can use these to get into the x show
6456245 the door guy over there probably wouldnt even know the difference and wont it be fun to try
6456246 this gentleman and i have some important things to discuss and were going to need a couple of drinks to do it and a dark corner straight whiskey ought to do and have the band play some more etta james
6456247 youre going to need it before i do is my guess
6456248 do me a favor and be careful shes been in here before you know
6456249 after my release i do not intend to return to the oil industry
6456250 i intend to engage in humanitarian activities and dedicate myself to my family
6456251 there is a great deal of resistance to freeing khodorkovsky
6456252 i dont think that its on the cards this time
6456253 his bland poached eggs at elaborate state dinners while everyone around him gorged themselves
6456254 feels certain that her injuries were caused by another animal
6456255 its hard to believe that she could do something so cruel when she has always been such a timid dog anyhow i guess we trust the vets theory because of this new understanding we dont feel that it is right to ask for donations for something that may have happened by another dog if anyone has already sent donations they will be returned immediately we are very honest people and do not want to mislead in any way which is why i have e mailed you as soon as i found out
6456256 the vet said she is going to have to wear a muzzle for about four weeks and eat only moist dog food until her jaw can heal it sounds like there wont be any permanent damage but i guess we cant guarantee that until the future
6456257 it will be sad for both dogs because they were best friends always together so im sure they will be lonely
6456258 a coworker of mine ended up driving up to the garland shelter to adopt cole he just called back to tell me that cole was still there and he adopted him side note the shelter told him that buttercup had been adopted a few hours before he arrived to adopt cole so both of the dogs that the soldier dropped off at the garland shelter have now been adopted at least they werent put down that would have been really tragic but i know it happens all the time
6456259 lowes must be the dumping ground for animals these days
6456260 under a truck she had a broken paw which has healed
6456261 rescuer has three other cats and is moving can only hold onto her until friday when she will take her to vet to put her down

6456309 listen children to my story it was written long ago abou dadada dada dadadada
6456310 no he couldnt possibly follow me to the h o r d e festival
6456311 do you have the time to listen to me whine abou dadada dada dadadada da dadada dada dadadada
6456312 yeah well id never buy one because the thingama jig is all out of whack
6456313 the needle has moved back to where it traditionally is on education in part because of the backlash against the no child left behind act
6456314 people are responding based on uninformed opinions as the issues have only recently begun to surface
6456315 this was shocking to all of us to the medical community
6456316 this was the first time in history that a baby was reported dying from breast milk
6456317 if that duplication of the gene may be five per cent which we believe it is for the canadian public in general this is 5 000 babies a year just in canada that may be exposed to that risk of mom being an ultra metabolizer
6456318 there was another severe poisoning that might have been fatal but mom also was very groggy so she stopped breastfeeding
6456319 so probably the baby was saved by not being breastfed
6456320 babies are much more sensitive to morphine than we thought in the past
6456321 we believe that should be a red flag from now on
6456322 so theres a lot of reason to rethink how we practise we need people to rethink it and especially if some babies may die from it thats totally unacceptable
6456323 my major concern with tylenol 3s are they actually provide minimal additional analgesic benefit
6456324 so if youre not providing additional pain relief why are you giving a compound that in one to two per cent of women looks as though it could be dangerous for their infant
6456325 i dont think it should be on the obstetrical unit formulary i think it should be withheld
6456326 it shouldnt provoke alarm among individual patients but it should provoke concern among professionals
6456327 as you get older the vaccine becomes less cost effective
6456328 the pattern was people in certain long term care facilities
6456329 the median age in the males is 76 and in the females is 80
6456330 this is a company that has a culture of food safety
6456331 were taking appropriate broad comprehensive and definitive action as it relates to this facility this involves people we want people to understand theres a recall we want people to have that information
6456332 i strongly advise the public especially those at high risk for listeriosis to make sure they avoid consuming these products
6456333 i have also asked all public health units to advise emergency rooms in their jurisdictions to be on alert for cases all suspect and confirmed cases of listeriosis must be reported immediately to local public health units and in turn to the ministry within one business day of notification of report
6456334 they would simply not use the meat they would move into other foods its as simple as that
6456335 people arent going to take a chance the products theyre talking about arent ones that are a heavy part of menus in most of the homes i havent heard from anybody who has an issue over this
6456336 to predict when youre going to complete an investigation is practically impossible
6456337 with the tomato issue in the united states it went on for three or four months
6456338 we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause but food safety and quality at mcdonalds will not be compromised
6456339 we are closely monitoring the situation and are taking guidance from the canadian food inspection agency
6456340 the wind of change is blowing through this continent whether we like it or not this growth of national consciousness is a political fact and we must take account of it
6456341 may help strengthen your bodys natural immune system and promote overall wellness
6456342 these are meaningless claims designed to move product they know this claim is something were going to be attracted to even if theres no evidence that the stuff really helps
6456343 i would personally not buy anything certified as organic from china
6456344 china has a very very small almost non existent food testing program
6456345 id be concerned that despite the organic label the food might be adulterated
6456346 im a pepsi addict i dont smoke i dont drink i dont curse
6456347 people are trying to be healthier and replace soft drinks with fruit drinks and its not reducing their risk of diabetes
6456348 whether fat or thin cut out soft drinks or other
6456349 youll cut your risk its not hard to do losing 20 pounds thats hard to do

6456389 britney is a song about what our culture says and does to young women these days its about the lies we tell them about fame and money and whats beautiful and what will give them life its an apology for those lies but more than that its an invitation to the truth about a god who is bigger than the pain this world so often leaves them in

6456408 werder bremen steht auch f r leidenschaft und performance wie unser neuer scirocco und beiden ist schwer zu widerstehen deshalb freuen wir uns dass wir das comeback dieses legend ren sportcoup s exklusiv mit den fans an der weser feiern k nnen
6456409 dieses ganz besondere teammitglied mit dem markanten werder tattoo darf am 23 august nat rlich nicht fehlen und soll unsere besondere verbundenheit mit dem club unterstreichen
6456410 in einem schwierigen marktumfeld haben wir erneut unsere verl sslichkeit unter beweis gestellt
6456411 in der gegenw rtigen situation an den finanzm rkten hat sich unsere langj hrige erfahrung und unser fachwissen als kapitalanleger ausgezahlt davon profitieren unsere kunden
6456412 wir hatten zu keiner zeit us hypotheken subprime mortgages in unseren b chern stehen
6456413 es wird jedoch noch eine gewisse zeit dauern bis alle produktivit tsvorteile ausgesch pft sind weil sich viele unserer mitarbeiter mit einer grundlegend ver nderten arbeitsweise vertraut machen m ssen
6456414 wir gehen davon aus diesen vor auslaufen des sozialplans ende 2009 abgeschlossen zu haben
6456415 wir werden auch in zukunft unsere sicherheitsorientierte anlagestrategie fortsetzen um mit begrenztem risiko eine m glichst hohe rendite zu erzielen
6456416 gerade die lebensversicherung ist wegen ihres langfristigen anlagehorizonts besonders geeignet schwankungen an den b rsen abzufangen und den kunden verl ssliche leistungen zu garantieren
6456417 bis mitte n chsten jahres werden sich die st rken einer auf die kunden konzentrierten und sparten bergreifenden serviceorganisation voll entfaltet haben und f r kunden und vermittler erlebbar werden
6456418 im letzten jahr haben wir mit der gr ndung der drei servicegesellschaften das solide fundament f r einen besseren und konkurrenzf higeren kundenservice geschaffen die ergebnisse k nnen sich sehen lassen die erreichbarkeit unserer servicehotlines die vom kunden wahrgenommene servicequalit t und die termintreue unserer techniker haben wir deutlich verbessert f r die mitarbeiter eine moderne bearbeitungssoftware in die kundeninformationssysteme eingespielt und den service samstag eingef hrt mit letzterem haben wir sogar ma st be f r die telekommunikationsbranche gesetzt
6456419 aber wir m ssen weiter an der zukunftsf higkeit unserer organisation arbeiten deshalb packen wir nun die n chsten aufgaben an
6456420 im marktvergleich haben wir zu viele und zu kleine service center die bauliche und auch die technische ausstattung insgesamt entspricht l ngst nicht mehr dem erforderlichen branchenstandard um f r unsere kunden noch besser zu werden und den mitarbeitern bessere arbeitsbedingungen zu bieten wollen wir innerhalb der n chsten zwei jahre in 24 st dten die vorhandenen service center zu modernen und attraktiven zentren ausbauen in denen unsere mitarbeiter gut arbeiten k nnen und dies auch gerne tun
6456421 gleichzeitig bleiben wir mit unseren service centern in der fl che deutschlands vertreten da wir bei der planung darauf geachtet haben dass die 24 st dte ber das ganze bundesgebiet verteilt sind eine verlagerung ins ausland wie es andere unternehmen tun ist f r uns berhaupt kein thema
6456422 wir brauchen also gr ere standorte mit der neuen struktur kommen wir auf eine durchschnittliche standortgr e von etwa 700 mitarbeitern auf dieser basis sind service center wie sie f r die anforderungen eines modernen telekommunikationsunternehmens wie der deutschen telekom notwendig sind wesentlich wirtschaftlicher zu betreiben damit haben wir eine gute balance zwischen zeitgem en arbeitsplatzbedingungen und betriebswirtschaftlichen notwendigkeiten gefunden wie z b branchen bliche kosten f r informationssysteme sowie ausstattungs und mietkosten
6456423 daf r haben wir sogar den einen oder anderen kleineren standort in das neue konzept aufgenommen
6456424 das spornt an f hrt zu besseren ergebnissen und ist damit gut f r unsere kunden
6456425 bei der auswahl der 24 st dte haben wir intensiv gepr ft wie die notwendige zusammenlegung f r unternehmen und mitarbeiter bestm glich realisiert werden kann nat rlich wird es f r einen teil der mitarbeiter dadurch l ngere fahrtzeiten zum arbeitsplatz geben
6456426 auch hier streben wir sozialvertr gliche l sungen an sollte in einzelf llen aber aufgrund von speziellen berufs und lebenssituationen die fahrt zum neuen arbeitsplatz oder ein umzug f r eine mitarbeiterin oder einen mitarbeiter nicht m glich sein werden wir nach kr ften l sungen suchen
6456427 die eingliederung der technik zentren ist ein logischer und konsequenter schritt der aus der gr ndung der deutschen telekom netzproduktion gmbh vor mehr als einem jahr folgt
6456428 schon damals haben wir die vollst ndige b ndelung der technikkompetenzen erwogen aber aufgrund der komplexit t zun chst zur ckgestellt heute blicken wir auf mehr als ein jahr positiver erfahrungen bei den servicegesellschaften zur ck telekom service und die damit verbundene st rkung unternehmerischer verantwortung hat sich bew hrt
6456429 ja die mitarbeiter werden beispielsweise die gleiche wochenarbeitszeit wie ihre kollegen haben also statt 34 dann 38 stunden arbeiten und auch das gehalt soll auf das niveau der servicegesellschaften gebracht werden nat rlich mit den bekannten abfederungen damit st rken wir die wirtschaftliche leistungsf higkeit unserer netzproduktion im interesse unserer kunden und damit letztlich auch unserer mitarbeiter
6456430 wir wissen dass wir noch einen langen weg vor uns haben wir werden f r unsere kunden weiter an der verbesserung der servicequalit t arbeiten ein hochmodernes netz f r tolle produkte bauen und m glichst vielen menschen einen sicheren arbeitsplatz bieten

6456442 for a long time the board of directors has been aware that the two very different business models of ingredients and sugar respectively were not an optimal combination
6456443 with these words the board of directors asks the annual general meeting for a mandate to close the sale of danisco sugar to german based nordzucker
6456444 if the annual general meeting rejects the proposal the board of directors will consider it a mandate to work towards an independent stock exchange listing or other alternatives
6456445 we are working hard to become a market driven organisation through and through by for example optimising and motivating our sales force so that danisco is at the top of relevant customers minds we want to be the company with the strongest innovation team the innovative company which others want to cooperate with and finally we want to be leading in sustainable production and products
6456446 we already have products in all those areas today but we want to be among the three largest and best in the world this requires an effort and could also involve acquisitions we are determined to be in the top three because we know that it is a market with solid growth rates
6456447 dupont has the expertise we dont have and we have what dupont doesnt have together we form a partnership that will end up in a sustainable product based on residue from for instance agriculture or forestry
6456448 each party is initially investing up to dkk 350 million over the next three years that is a lot of money but just listen to this we foresee a market for second generation bioethanol of at least usd 75 billion in 2020 corresponding to around dkk 400 billion
6456449 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6456450 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6456451 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6456452 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6456453 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6456454 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6456455 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6456456 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6456457 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6456458 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6456459 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
6456460 and as we said from the beginning there is no hidden agenda here
6456461 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
6456462 we as the sadr movement denounce this dubious visit and such timing we reaffirm our stance of rejecting the long term agreement we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible
6456463 we are pleased to announce the release of the service manager community technical preview ctp 1 and would like to encourage you to download evaluate and provide feedback on the build

6456467 from the brewery to the bar beer has a very male persona
6456468 we want to do more than just get women drinking beer we want to get them excited about drinking beer our philosophy is that beer is a good thing that women are missing out on thats what eve is about
6456469 blue moon is interesting because it is a dark beer but its performance in the us indicates women will drink dark beer if the taste is sweet enough
6456470 there is also a perception among women that beer is overly calorific which is not the case it has no more calories per ml than other forms of alcohol so that is a myth that needs dispelling
6456471 our research indicates different portion sizes such as 300ml servings as well as slightly sweeter formulations will appeal to women

6456505 cops and former secret service agents ran black ops on green groups
6456506 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
6456507 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government

6456525 where the customs house is now to the northwest of the fort you see it on early drawings of the city
6456526 a series of wooden gears and so forth would work a shaft hooked up to a gang of saws
6456527 a ferry ran over from manhattan to long island he was to cease operations when he saw the sails taken off the windmill in manhattan that would be the forewarning of a storm coming across from the west

6456549 i have amazed myself by the turnaround to be honest but im loving every minute of it now i wouldnt change my life for anything

6456557 quite conservative in its projections of obesity prevalence and estimates of attributable fractions for conditions associated with obesity diabetes cardiovascular disease various types of cancer and osteoarthritis
6456558 these new figures are tragic and frightening and represent a wake up call for the nation
6456559 they show that previous estimates of the epidemics size and cost were very much understated
6456560 we know that obesity and type two diabetes can be prevented and we need to make fundamental changes in the way we live to arrest the escalating crisis

6456572 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6456573 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6456574 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6456575 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6456576 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6456577 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting

6456584 the things i do and greater will you do in my name
6456585 we dont want to risk insulting someone else hurting someones feelings over what we think is evil
6456586 this is how its always been done forcing non discriminatory hiring if you use federal funds
6456587 faith based organizations should not be advantaged or disadvantaged when it comes to getting federal funds by virtue of the fact that they are faith based organizations
6456588 i believe in communism that we should take from each according to their ability and give to each according to their need

6456591 we have our own ideas about what persecution is like preventing gay marriage for example or speaking out of bible against what is intolerantly referred to as a sin
6456592 i predicted new orleans would come back as a stronger and better city we helped deliver 126 billion in taxpayer money
6456593 who would have thought three years after the storm the president could come and say new orleans la
6456594 i think the message here today is hope is being restored hope is coming back
6456595 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can

6456602 one of the illusions of life is that the present hour is not the critical decisive hour write it on your heart that every day is the best day of the year
6456603 losing for the first time since 2000 the u s softball team was denied a chance for a fourth straight gold medal thursday beaten 3 1 by japan in the sports last appearance in the olympics for at least eight years and maybe for good yukiko ueno japans remarkably resilient right hander shut down the americans and handed them their first loss since sept 21 2000 at the sydney games the u s had won 22 straight since then most of them with outrageously lopsided scores
6456604 they were promised the future of mobile phones but many owners of apples iphone 3g say the only future they have seen since its july 11th debut is a series of problems and software updates
6456605 it basically does everything i want it to do except for sometimes it doesnt it will open up give me a title page or splash card for a couple of seconds and then itll just go back to the home screen
6456606 were here in the heart of the financial district and i dont even have 3g connectivity so its kind of a bummer
6456607 its frozen quite a few times and ive only had it for two weeks its a little bit annoying
6456608 which could mean the headaches for some iphone 3g users arent going away anytime soon
6456609 its just kind of crapping out all the time before the update on monday it wasnt really getting calls very well it was dropping calls all the time then i updated on monday and now the calls function works fine but im having a lot of problems with the application and the internet browsing function so its really wonky these days its not very dependable
6456610 we have to remember that when 3g was launched in europe a couple of years ago they had very similar problems so we shouldnt blame this only on apple its a brand new network its a brand new technology gonna have a bunch of 3g phones really soon theyre rolling out their 3g network so were gonna see problems with this across the board because 3gs very new to us
6456611 thats my deadline if its not working by halloween im gonna go back to my blackberry but i think we should have some patience either that or maybe ill just write the word sucker across my forehead because i have faith in the iphone
6456612 some of the last generation nanos have been overheating and giving their owners minor burns so its not just spontaneous combustion where its going to light on fire and your hair catches on fire something like that but it will overheat from time to time and then you get some burns but this is the last generation nano the one they sold about two years ago the current generation of nanos hasnt had any problems reported
6456613 all gadgets are prone to overheating like that computers laptops things like that we should expect that pretty much all gadgets may overheat
6456614 there are things you can do you can run your battery for the full lifecycle of your gadgets battery life and never ever ever buy a counterfeit battery ever because those are prone to explode
6456615 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6456616 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6456617 the issue with canyon college is that theyre not accredited by an agency recognized by the u s department of education or the council for higher education accreditation or the idaho state board of education
6456618 canyon college claims that its accredited by some outfit that nobodys heard of takes peoples money and then supplies them with a transcript and diploma thats not worth the paper its written on
6456619 every state varies in terms of what degrees they accept and we always tell our students to check their states requirements
6456620 when someone isnt satisfied we have to handle it and we gave janet back the money within one business day
6456621 accreditation in the u s is not required and to become accredited by federal agencies you have to pay expensive fees charge your students more and accept federal backed student loans
6456622 we are an independent college with affordable tuition and we want to maintain that
6456623 i earned every bit of it and ive been able to use what i learned they should have told me it wouldnt be recognized
6456624 to avoid these diploma mills know that a school should be either regionally and or nationally accredited by an agency that is recognized by the u s secretary of education as a reliable authority
6456625 proper state registration and academic accreditation are the two most critical issues for any potential student to be aware of these accrediting agencies can be found on the u s department of educations web site
6456626 the only difference is that nationally accredited schools may or may not have the rigor of general education expectation because theyre based more on a specific career field or vocation
6456627 as soon as i got accepted i got a call from a counselor who walked me through the entire financial aid process and any scholarship opportunities available
6456628 this made me feel a lot more confident about enrolling in classes
6456629 they told me that since theyd maintained such low costs they couldnt offer financial aid
6456630 undergo a week long training program on how to navigate the course management systems and facilitate online communication
6456631 we provide this because faculty tends to find it very difficult to teach their first few online classes
6456632 they have to re learn all of the teaching customs and mechanisms and adapt them to the online environment which can be difficult to do
6456633 during the accrediting process were looking at how courses are developed if the curriculum fits the program thats being offered and has learning outcomes and if there is support for students at nights and on weekends
6456634 to become accredited an institution must prove its developed a true commitment to online learning
6456635 this is a success story for one person but she still cant get the time or effort back that it took to complete four years of coursework
6456636 there are many fine and reputable online schools out there
6456637 why do i have to do this if youre not going
6456638 i am not i do not want to do it
6456639 come on dude im not going if youre not going
6456640 its the thing i despise most about this job i dont want to be in gq i want to go home
6456641 hes taken a really serious turn for the worse just now
6456642 the vets have had a look theyve said hes having breathing difficulties his flippers are at an unusual angle hes not going to last much longer you should put him down
6456643 the vets who had a look at him were really surprised at how fast hed gone downhill
6456644 their advice to us was hes not going to last much longer hes suffering and you should take action
6456645 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard on
6456646 leading alliance members came to us and whispered in our ears hoping that we do not halt cooperation with nato on afghanistan
6456647 everything depends on nato if their priorities go to the unconditional support of the bankrupt regime of georgian president mikhail saakashvili regime to the detriment of partnership with nato its not our fault
6456648 poco inter s y oscurantismo con el que los responsables del parque de bomberos tratan el segundo vuelco de un mismo cami n que se sald con varios funcionarios lesionados
6456649 como bien conocen los sindicatos fue precisamente la propia tenencia de alcald a de econom a e interior quien a ra z del suceso concretamente el 31 de julio convoc una reuni n extraordinaria del comit de seguridad y salud del ayuntamiento de motril para abordar el tema
6456650 en esta reuni n extraordinaria el nico punto del orden del d a fue el vuelco del cami n y que adem s en ella se comunic a los miembros del comit de seguridad y salud los informes existentes de los talleres inspecci n t cnica de veh culos y el informe de la polic a local en relaci n a los hechos ocurridos indic ndoles que el correspondiente atestado de la guardia civil se les facilitar a cuando se disponga del mismo
6456651 esta aportaci n la tiene que hacer epsa de todos modos a los gastos de urbanizaci n como propietaria de m s del 30 del suelo como tiene que hacer cualquier otro particular que tenga terrenos all por lo que vemos que el anuncio de invertir 10 8 millones de euros por parte de la consejer a de vivienda es un ejemplo m s de la pol tica de marketing de la junta de andaluc a que acostumbra a inflar las cifras de inversi n en los municipios andaluces
6456652 por lo que le pedimos que no lo haga de manera que el precio de venta de los solares de epsa salgan al mercado a la mitad del precio
6456653 esto significar a un importante impulso econ mico puesto que las parcelas pasar an de costar 300 euros por metro cuadrado a 150 euros por metro cuadrado con los consiguientes beneficios para las empresas que se quieran implantar en el futuro pol gono industrial del puerto
6456654 porque no se puede enga ar a los motrile os con medias verdades cuando se afirma que la junta va a invertir 19 3 millones de euros si en realidad los 10 8 millones de euros de aportaci n de epsa ya estaban previstos
6456655 puesto que llevamos m s de un a o trabajando en ello de forma incansable algo que si hubieran hecho los gobiernos municipales anteriores bajo las siglas del psoe a d a de hoy estar an ya en marcha las obras de urbanizaci n y no como estamos actualmente es decir a la espera de que la junta de andaluc a desbloquee un proyecto de vital importancia para motril y el resto de la comarca
6456656 se informe mejor del estado actual de este importante proyecto porque no se pueden anunciar por parte de la junta inversiones para una infraestructura que ellos mismos tienen parada

6456675 this breakdown of the peace process is not caused by the milf we have been very consistent we have been very observing the cease fire but in spite of all of this the government does not honor its commitments
6456676 its in tatters its in tatters i dont know how to pick up the pieces
6456677 i think things look really grim at the moment i think theres a good chance that it will be a while and i mean years before we can get back to where we were before the court order stopped the agreement from being implemented
6456678 but i think as well there are real questions about whether either party negotiating the agreement did enough work with its own constituents
6456679 theres been some fairly bellicose statements coming out of the armed forces
6456680 i think probably both sides would prefer not to have to go back to conflict but what was holding hostilities back was the prospect that peace was at least if not around the corner on the horizon and now its a big question mark

6456722 estamos trabajando en esta obra que ha sido licitada para poner en condiciones refaccionar y mejorar la plaza 9 de julio y tambi n le compete la ampliaci n de la calle paseo la intenci n del gobierno de la provincia y de la municipalidad es terminar las trabajos lo m s pronto posible antes del plazo de la ejecuci n ya que tenemos asegurado presupuestaria y financieramente los recursos para terminar estas obras originalmente el plazo de ejecuci n est previsto para nueve meses pero trataremos de acercarnos a los seis o siete meses para no molestar a los que transitan la calle y disfrutan de la plaza
6456723 se va a mejorar la iluminaci n se pondr n nuevas fuentes y se van a propiciar las mejores condiciones para aquellos que ocupan la plaza y necesitan de ella originalmente se tiene pensado empezar por la calle paseo sobre la calle bol var y por condiciones de seguridad se debe desocuparla ya que la empresa se hace cargo a partir de ese momento de la obra y ya tiene que ir hallando espacios
6456724 la decisi n est tomada y se esta estudiando firmemente y ver las posibilidades de ejecutar la obra y tendr a capacidad para 165 veh culos seg n el proyecto
6456725 el estacionamiento va a brindar un servicio importante en cuanto a la construcci n de la calle paseo ya que las tres cuadras mas la calle san mart n la continuaci n de la bol var y el tramo de f lix de azara le quita la capacidad de estacionamiento de alrededor de 25 autos por cuadra entonces de esa forma estar amos compensando esta falta de estacionamiento por la construcci n de la calle paseo estamos pensando en una primera etapa de construcci n y en la segunda en lo que ser a el servicio y la ocupaci n a trav s de la municipalidad dos niveles para el estacionamiento es un proyecto hay ideas de hacerlo de tres niveles pero de esta forma la complejidad los costos de la obra y los riesgos son mayores creo que con dos esta bien pensado y estudiado y 165 veh culos en una cuadra es un n mero importante nuestra idea es que en el futuro cuando sigamos construyendo la calle paseo por bol var hasta rivadavia es continuar con el estacionamiento subterr neo
6456726 anoche estuvimos hablando con ellos estamos organizando con arquitectura de la provincia la construcci n de los estanes en el paseo bossetti van a tener mas comodidades e infraestructuras la plaza no es adecuada para el trabajo y la permanencia de cualquier persona y menos los artesanos hay algunos que est n de acuerdo y otros no desde la municipalidad estamos preparando una convocatoria a los artesanos para una capacitaci n y la adquisici n de herramientas b sicas para realizar sus tareas lo importante es darle m s calidad a la artesan a posade a que represente la historia y que represente lo que los turistas esperan de una ciudad cuando vienen y se quieren llevar un recuerdo
6456727 la plaza debe quedar deshabitada y exclusivamente para la empresa que realizar los trabajos y tambi n por seguridad mientras dure la ejecuci n de las obras

6456824 i was talking to myself tuesday and thinking about the steep fine and how much it was but the league has to do what it has to do in order to keep the nfl in the right direction it sounds steep and me personally i dont have anything on my record anymore but its the personal conduct policy and you have to abide by it
6456825 most of the actions were fights broken jaws stuff like that
6456826 mine was kind of just disorderly conduct which it was i guess that falls under the personal conduct that fights over theres no winning that battle i go with the rules they set now i get to play monday night pockets are a little lighter but i still get to play
6456827 it was definitely an experience that i dont want to experience again
6456828 id rather go on a more positive note ill tell you that
6456829 but thats the way the league assesses things i was surprised initially that they wanted to suspend nick for such a minor offense im still surprised at the substantial fine but im pleased the suspension was lifted
6456830 i was just trying to get away from it and move on and play football it still ended with the same result i didnt get any charges or anything like that but if i would have fought it and it came back not guilty im sure it wouldve been a different disciplinary action from the nfl

6456846 its probably the first time weve had to do this but the games are only once every four years

6456867 it is not in the character of nigerians to be engaged in this kind of scam

6456869 the policy criminalises people with disabilities and their families who are struggling for want of government funded support
6456870 when someone reaches a point they can no longer do the caring the only way theyve been able to get care is to leave a person in respite i dress my child feed him bathe him and no one can strip me of my parenthood i dont want them to get guardianship because i might object to where they want to place him

6456875 hillsong and other parties have approached us about the south sydney hospital site which is publicly known to be zoned for redevelopment
6456876 the city is regularly approached by developers or other groups about our properties
6456877 any eventual development will be subject to a development application process and will need to respect the sites heritage items
6456878 it is truly just two bus stops up the road
6456879 i would hope the council would not be interested in entertaining a mega church or entertainment centre on the hospital site this has nothing to do with religion we are extremely worried about the traffic
6456880 it would be good site for a future school or hospital or aged care facility
6456881 when i crossed the line i thought this is the biggest thing in my sport and i didnt enjoy it
6456882 this is an area not well handled in the past
6456883 we do know it is a very big issue especially for athletes retiring who can suffer long term considerable downs
6456884 it is difficult i can see how athletes suffer from depression you spend the last 12 to 13 years of your life preparing for an olympic gold medal and when it stops it is a hollow feeling
6456885 softball is a big part of our culture we spend a lot of time together and we email phone talk all the time it is important to have that support for our sport its a good thing
6456886 we are hoping this process will bring about a more successful outcome
6456887 in recent years the stigma in terms of mental health has abated and most athletes seek access to psychologists in the same way as getting some sports science or sports medicine

6456889 rigorous and credible process for identifying the states most excellent teachers
6456890 if teachers want to link higher level skills and professional recognition to higher pay then we would readily examine that as part of our wages negotiations
6456891 the rudd government has also indicated it is interested in developing proposals to reward higher level teaching and wed welcome input by the commonwealth in this debate
6456892 we are simply concerned that the best teachers be recognised
6456893 the key to this system is that we actually identify the best teachers our emphasis is that the process is credible to both teachers and the community
6456894 we would like to be involved in investigating and discussing the idea of higher levels of accreditation as something that could be recognised by additional pay
6456895 it is critical for the government to put new money in for this because if there is no new money some teachers will be paid extra at the expense of others
6456896 it is like being in any kind of professional organisation

6456920 i have great respect for werner m llers achievements through his strategic foresight and enormous personal commitment he developed the excellent idea of the establishment of a foundation and played a key role in driving it forward together with politicians the ig bce labor union and the shareholders of the former rag group he has given rag evonik and thus the entire ruhr region a new social and economic perspective for the future we all have a great deal to thank him for
6456921 i would like to thank mr bonse geuking and the executive committee of the supervisory board for accepting my request my philosophy is go when the going is good the past five years at rag and subsequently evonik have been the biggest challenge of my working life through the foundation model the evonik group has been given a sound basis for its future development and a solution has been found for the future of the mining industry without compulsory redundancies i am proud of that none of this would have been possible without the commitment of our employees and their ability and willingness to help shape the process of change i would also specifically like to express my thanks to the german chancellor dr merkel to mr beck chairman of the spd party the government ministers mr steinbr ck and mr glos mr r ttgers minister president of north rhine westphalia and mr m ller minister president of the saarland mr schmoldt chairman of the ig bce labor union and mr ladzinski chairman of the working group of the rag works councils
6456922 i am grateful to mr bonse geuking and the executive committee of the supervisory board for their confidence in me and for this tremendous opportunity i would be delighted if the supervisory board were to place me at the head of the evonik group i would also like to thank werner m ller because without him there would be no evonik group today

6456926 the closing order indictment does not charge duch for his responsibility as a co perpetrator for a significant number of crimes that occurred as part of a joint criminal enterprise inside s 21

6456928 we had been discussing a viral campaign for three or four months now placing some stuff on the net so some of this was just wacky timing
6456929 the whole concept behind our campaign was that we wanted people to be looking at our web site while they were thinking they were looking at someone elses
6456930 and when i think about how it might affect fall out boy all i can say is that petes a clever bloke and he probably wouldve done the same thing had he thought of it
6456931 i mean think about it the two campaigns are very similar theirs is supposed to look like an ominous organization thats mucking around the way the two campaigns crossed didnt hurt anyone
6456932 the whole idea was mocking other sites and if life went according to plan you wouldve seen that continue instead it got ripped to shreds overnight
6456933 but like i said this wasnt done maliciously and everything ive heard about pete is that hes a marketing kind of guy hes the king of making people talk and ruffling feathers so he wouldve done the same thing if he could have so if fall out boy fans are mad about this whole thing well all i can say is that pete wouldve done the same thing

6456939 the resume is a key component of any business school application yet many applicants fail to tailor this document to the admissions process our guide has been forged from clear admit
6456940 clear admit does an excellent job in helping prospective applicants learn about individual schools through the school guides providing great information about specific programs in the context of how they compare to other schools on similar metrics
6456941 by bringing together student opinion official statistics and original research the lbs school guide offers an authentic snapshot of life in our program the cross school analysis presented in the guide is invaluable for candidates who are looking to go beyond rankings and understand the nuances of leading programs
6456942 from my perspective obama needs to introduce a game changer and fast before public opinion starts to gel around the notion that he is a phenom who deserves great respect but is not seasoned enough and would be too much of a risk in the oval office
6456943 the mccain campaign believes that some of hillary clintons tactics especially questioning whether obama is ready to lead can be a real winner
6456944 the mccain team has been very open that they went to school on the hillary clinton campaign that they learned from that
6456945 and on this 3 a m ad whats very striking as some have pointed out over the last few days is that barack obama was winning a steady streak of victories against hillary clinton
6456946 and then she ran that ad and she really went on the attack on the experience question and she won the bulk of the primaries thereafter in the closing months of the democratic primaries and won 500 000 more votes than he did and almost took it away from him
6456947 which candidate do voters believe is better qualified to deal with russia mccain by better than 2 to 1
6456948 going after more centrist voters more swing voters more conservative voters who will be a much bigger deal in the general election than they were in those primaries and caucuses
6456949 what the clinton campaign demonstrated is when you bring obama back down to earth its a better battle
6456950 along comes mccain who not only has he doesnt like to talk about his religion very much and then he talks about it openly but he has a very powerful story thats emotionally connected to the audience
6456951 its the candidate who can connect emotionally to middle america who will have the big advantage going down the stretch
6456952 the big question now is whether obama can successfully regain control of the campaign agenda as we head into the democratic convention
6456953 the president and prime minister reaffirmed their mutual support for going after these extremists that are a threat to both pakistan the united states and the entire world
6456954 to working with the prime minister and the to address the ongoing battle against extremists and to assist pakistan through its current economic situation
6456955 but because of the absolute blackout on information there we have been unable to do that
6456956 reliable witnesses say that 400 people have been killed in the region of the tibetan capital
6456957 killed by bullets even though they were protesting without weapons their bodies were never given back to their families if you consider the whole of tibet the number of victims is obviously higher
6456958 ten thousand people have been arrested we dont know where they are imprisoned
6456959 makes me think that this colonisation by the army is destined to last
6456960 a project of long term brutal repression is under way
6456961 but we were quickly disillusioned our envoys came up against a wall there was no opening
6456962 real autonomy because we know what chinese style autonomy is a trap
6456963 where can i see you on the public web site
6456964 we are hoping to get as wide an approval as possible so that we can move on with regard to having this agreement for congress to look at
6456965 we think this agreement is very good for the united states and india and for the international community otherwise we would not be pursuing this
6456966 this deal was foolish when pakistan was relatively stable with mr musharraf gone an arms race on the subcontinent would likely be more difficult to control
6456967 uma defini o plena cristalina e inequ voca a quem tem o compromisso do bem de condenar essas a es criminosas
6456968 beijing police decided to give the six 10 days of
6456969 for the chinese authorities to sentence them at all shows the governments paranoia and intolerance of even the most peaceful challenges to its control
6456970 this should be a pretty good year for leaf color change
6456971 although there was enough rainfall this spring to keep the trees healthy we are still in drought conditions in the western part of the state which surprisingly is good for fall color fortunately the summer temperatures have not been as consistently hot as we had last year so we should not experience the early leaf drop we had last fall it all adds up to a nice long progression of fall color
6456972 if the temperatures in september and october cooperate and cool down contributing to the breakdown of chlorophyll we should expect to see some brilliant fall colors this year
6456973 last year there was not much of a peak although we did see some brilliant color this year the trees should be on a more typical color schedule peaking in mid october in the mountains
6456974 and a sharp cooling of temperatures in september and october would really cause the colors to burst as this stimulates the production of anthocyanin or red pigments
6456975 its good for cbc radio to be playing a variety of musical genres but this is a radical change it is moving away from something only the public broadcaster can do to something many private broadcasters already do and they are shoving classical music into the 10 a m to 3 p m low audience ghetto
6456976 because of the strength of the cosmo brand we think theres a distinctive market for young women in a crowded digital universe
6456977 tv will fundamentally change how we talk about imagine and experience the internet
6456978 this is the beginning of a number of distribution announcements that will go beyond content producers to oems
6456979 right now were going to go through the details of the decision before making further comment
6456980 programming dedicated primarily to the coverage and celebration of canadian athletes with a particular emphasis on amateur athletes
6456981 its a bit of a compromise and i think its not unreasonable
6456982 i think its a win win cbcs going be able to do what they said they want to do which is celebrate amateur sports and canadian athletes and athletics and not basically just be a second network for cbc to run live sporting events all day long
6456983 expects the cbc to abide by its commitment to broadcast 80 per cent canadian content in each broadcast year
6456984 we have not journeyed all this way across the centuries across the oceans across the mountains across the prairies because we are made of sugar candy

6456989 nivelul de crestere a numarului de pasageri se accelereaza odata cu perioada concediilor de vara si cunoaste un nou boom in apropierea sarbatorilor de iarna astfel consideram ca vom atinge si chiar depasi pragul anticipat pentru sustinerea acestei afirmatii ne bazam pe rezultatele anului trecut cand ponderea pasagerilor transportati in lunile iulie august si septembrie au reprezentat 33 din total

6456991 nunca te justifiques os amigos n o precisam e os inimigos n o acreditam
6456992 in prima parte a acestui an am mers foarte mult de vanzarile catre companii acestea fiind afaceri pe care am inceput sa le negociem anul trecut acum mergem foarte mult pe retail si vindem in medie 2 000 de pensii facultative pe luna catre persoane fizice pe vanzarile catre companii este greu de facut o estimare depinde ce grupuri ai

6456994 daca observam ca bancile devin foarte dependente de banci centrale atunci trebuie sa facem in asa fel incat sa le indreptam spre alte surse de finantare

6457006 live the rest of your life in the flesh for the will of god
6457007 when i first began the quest to find beautiful color palettes one of the original objectives was to capture colors as quickly as possible so as not to disrupt the fleeting creative process one day i was in my office inspired by the colors of my red t shirt and smoky gray pants and i wanted to capture them right away and begin to design with them without having to take a picture transfer it to my hard drive ahhhh lol with the itm webcam edition you can capture the colors from your web cam images directly into this app visualize and then extract 1 1000s of colors and save them to adobe photoshop or illustrator cs3 or as an xml file for processing
6457008 if those logs for medications were in those records i would think thats probably why he would do it to cover up the fact that he was taking their medication
6457009 thompson health has strict procedures in place to protect all patient information it was because of our own internal monitoring process that we were able to immediately identify this activity collaborate with the authorities and to take additional steps to protect our patients and their medical records
6457010 i have found it to be the most treacherous 22 yards i have had displeasure to bat on
6457011 you need to work so hard for what runs you score even a fifty is almost as good as scoring a century all you need to do is apply sensible basics but they way the ball swings around and cuts off seam you need to be so careful
6457012 thought it would be an interesting thing to have a character who was handicapped or whatever the goddamned expression is supposed to be see how a person who was physically challenged would function in an atmosphere like this
6457013 its very fulfilling for me having never been taken seriously as an actress its a wonderful opportunity to show what i can do besides having cerebral palsy
6457014 this car is so smooth to drive and its so much fun on long distance trips that even though its only marketed as a commuter vehicle we take it on all our long distance trips
6457015 our phones and the phones of every one of our companies are ringing off the hook from consumers who say i want to convert my car
6457016 transportation is the only market where weve had one fuel think about it in residential commercial industrial power generation there are multiple fuels for different applications different parts of the country transportation its only petroleum thats over
6457017 there are whole areas of the country that are off limits to even look congress has said its off limits the whole east coast the whole west coast all around florida and in areas around the rockies are off limits
6457018 why dont you just take the natural gas and use it directly
6457019 there is no silver bullet answer to our transportation problems
6457020 were going to have to use all the fuels for the all the different applications
6457021 democrats republicans and independents alike are looking for change this election year
6457022 maybe while hes here john mccain can explain why his only plan for new mexicans is to give them more of the same bush administration policies that have resulted in job losses record foreclosure rates and sky high gas prices
6457023 what did i say idiots i meant indians what if they are both indians and they get their bow and arrows and shoot the president so that they can be the new president
6457024 first of all neither one is a native american second there is no shooting of arrows in elections people vote and thats how they choose
6457025 oh but if one was an indian and did have a bow and arrow that would be awesome
6457026 the fact that hes coming here its very important for us and the true nature of the man and his belief in a united jerusalem and the unbreakable connection of the jews to the holy land
6457027 i think the embassy should be where the people whose country its located would ask for it to be this is the israeli capital tel aviv is not
6457028 how would we feel if the israelis said we dont recognize washington d c were going to put our embassy in denver wed say excuse us thats not your choice to make and i think we frankly owe it to the israelis to respect where their capital is
6457029 some of the comments hes made regarding iran id sit down and talk with them im not sure if he realizes iran has stuff pointed right at israel and would love to use it and i just dont know if he fully grasps how serious the security issue is for israel
6457030 israel has every right to protect itself under those circumstances and the united states has a responsibility to stand by them if they do or to help them
6457031 because if iran were to weaponize its nuclear capacity and to use it its not just israel that needs to be worried the whole world needs to be worried
6457032 if i have to crawl across that finish line i am going to

6457067 the calf was in much worse condition than they originally thought and the injuries were a lot worse than they thought as well probably from a shark attack

6457071 this is certainly not what we would have hoped we would have hoped that the animal would have been ok
6457072 it is truly unfortunate when people are self conscious about their smiles
6457073 thankfully i have developed a proven method to subtly lower the lip line without extensive surgery this method has helped hundreds of my patients smile with confidence
6457074 for most people with gummy smiles there is no need for this degree of expense and discomfort
6457075 i offer an alternative approach that minimizes the appearance of a high lip line by lowering and repositioning the upper lip through a minor periodontal plastic surgery procedure the results i have been able to achieve are highly satisfying for my patients

6457087 the fact that uva investigators brought home four of 17 awards from a total of more than 100 applications and from researchers in 12 countries around the world speaks to our strength in this field

6457113 these new figures are tragic and frightening and represent a wake up call for the nation
6457114 they show that previous estimates of the epidemics size and cost were very much understated

6457246 soaring energy bills pose a huge threat to our standard of living gas and electricity are essential commodities which have now become a luxury that many can no longer afford
6457247 however you look at it today is a bad news day for consumers consumers are going to have to adjust quickly and there are two key steps to this making sure we pay the lowest possible price for our energy and learning to use less of it
6457248 its not just consumers who are confused about what drives price rises the wholesale price of oil and gas has fallen back in recent weeks but companies still feel the need to raise prices by staggering amounts
6457249 the hard fact is that prices are still set in relation to an irrational and toxic link to the price of oil whether the remedy is to break the contractual link between oil and gas prices or whether it is to find other ways to force greater competition into the european wholesale market it must be the subject of determined and vigorous intervention by competition authorities at home and in europe

6457315 nobody in our generation saw the real film noir films but we have connections to modern films like la confidential which took the good parts of film noir
6457316 we were aware the camera wasnt a very precise tool for moving but we still felt it was a cool feature to move around an environment and scroll over the maps
6457317 we have played a lot of point and clicks and they were very hardcore
6457318 few of us finished many of the games because they were so hard so we wanted to apply some modern game design thinking to dirk dagger making it easier and ensuring the content was highly polished and well thought through
6457319 we didnt want anything like the monkey wrench problem in monkey island
6457320 the humour in particular is an aspect that we integrated into the game
6457321 when we see people playing it and laughing its really satisfying
6457322 pada babak kedua kami seharusnya bisa melakukan banyak hal yang lebih baik lagi namun hasil itu cukup bagus bagi kami karena kami sedang membangun tim yang bisa tampil lebih baik lagi di pertandingan kualifikasi
6457323 kami akan bermain lebih dulu melawan andora sebelum lawan kroasia saya pikir penting untuk menuai hasil bagus di pertandingan pertama dan meraih poin di sana semua pemain kecewa karena tak lolos ke piala eropa namun kami akan memberikan 110 persen agar lolos ke piala dunia
6457324 penyerahan arca asli ini sesuai dengan keputusan pengadilan sedangkan arca yang palsu akan dimusnahkan tetapi hingga saat ini belum ada kepastian kapan dilakukan
6457325 sebab hingga kemarin saya masih melakukan koordinasi dengan beberapa pihak untuk mengambil keputusan mengenai siapa nantinya yang akan mengelola museum ini
6457326 kalau menurut saya yang paling tepat adalah kombinasi antara akademisi bp3 tokoh masyarakat pemerintak kota dan keraton yang penting orang orangnya tahu dan paham tentang benda purbakala dan cara menjaganya
6457327 bulan mei 2008 lalu dalam apel kesadaran saya sudah luncurkan program penaggulangan diare dan gizi buruk program ini didukung oleh dprd kabupaten ttu dukungan itu berupa persetujuan alokasi anggaran sebesar rp 600 juta untuk menanggulangi kasus penyakit diare dan gizi buruk di kabupaten ttu selama tahun 2008
6457328 selama ini pemberian makanan tambahan pmt terus berjalan dengan baik melalui posyandu kegiatan penimbangan disertai penyuluhan bagi ibu menyusui terus dilakukan semua berjalan baik karena memang ada dananya
6457329 seperti dua balita yang menderita kwashiorkor asal desa manuain a kecamatan insana memiliki pantangan makan ikan telur dan kacang hijau padahal makanan ini sangat bergizi petugas kesehatan tidak bisa memaksa balita mengkonsumsi makanan ini jika itu dianggap pemali pantang
6457330 misalnya pasangan suami istri usia muda tidak tahu mengurus anak balita dibiarkan terlantar dan hanya diberi makan seadanya kebiasaan ini berdampak buruk bagi kesehatan anak
6457331 periode sebelumnya yaitu januari agustus 2007 lalu jumlah kasus diare mencapai 800 kasus tapi sekarang sudah menurun drastis sampai akhir agustus baru 132 kasus
6457332 bukan hanya di rsud kefamenanu tapi juga di posyandu puskesmas pembantu serta puskesmas sudah diinstruksikan oleh kadis kesehatan ttu untuk tanggap terhadap kasus diare dan gizi buruk
6457333 obat obatan dan vitamin serta susu untuk balita penderita diare dan gizi buruk masih tersedia cukup banyak kalau sudah menipis pasti saya ajukan untuk pengadaan lagi
6457334 berdasarkan musyawarah keluarga diputuskan yang akan berangkat adalah saudara kembar dan kakak korban

6457336 i wouldnt say that its a critical issue or something thats a reason not to use the service but its definitely something that should be addressed
6457337 wed characterize this influenza vaccine candidate as very promising based upon the immune responses and tolerability we saw in the clinical trial participants
6457338 utmb is committed to further studies of the vaccine candidate which has the potential to be a safe highly effective and much needed option to prevent seasonal and pandemic influenza a
6457339 so long as we have enough people in this country willing to fight for their rights well be called a democracy
6457340 prescription sleeping pills can be important in certain situations but they can cause a lot of adverse effects and are not a long term solution for older people sleep medication can increase the risk of falling as well as interfering with other medicines
6457341 sleeping pills are not the best way to solve underlying problems like depression or painful conditions that are interfering with a good nights sleep
6457342 most people know that coffee cola or black tea can interfere with their sleep
6457343 but many do not realise that alcohol is one of the major causes of a bad nights sleep
6457344 right now theres not much you can do about the vector so it is all a matter of management
6457345 the wheat curl mite is found on volunteer wheat and many different grasses and is blown in the air by winds
6457346 very rarely did you find triticum without wheat streak mosaic
6457347 i really need to survey everywhere i can this year
6457348 in calculating the counties with wheat acreage infected in the northern panhandle early diagnosis could save as much as 9 million for producers by eliminating wasted irrigations
6457349 we werent testing for triticum at that time so it is also a factor to be investigated
6457350 we have the potential to save producers billions of dollars in wasted irrigation and fertilizer costs
6457351 only safe animal dietary supplements are allowed on the market

6457355 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6457356 the us has gone very far in this agreement it is a very advanced agreement
6457357 redoubling efforts to bring it a deal to a final conclusion
6457358 it has taken us a very long time but we are very very close to close this agreement
6457359 still issues concerning exactly how our forces will operate i think that is only natural at this point
6457360 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timeline aspirational timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe and what is reasonable
6457361 hes so busy im sure not even his agent can get a hold of him
6457362 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
6457363 most us consumers are happy with dvds according to a recent study by abi research and dont believe blu ray provides as big of a quality jump as dvds did over vhs tapes
6457364 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
6457365 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
6457366 never let the facts get in the way of a good rant
6457367 its important now to find compounds that can be used in imaging because the earlier clinicians can detect the disease the better the chances are that a drug will halt disease progression while patients still have strong cognitive abilities
6457368 when we added these compounds to the reaction their interaction with the tau protein inhibited filaments from forming which could be valuable for therapeutics because it would prevent the formation of tau tangles some people think if we clear away the pathology seen in diseased brains that might alleviate symptoms of alzheimers disease
6457369 the more carbs and sugars you eat the more your appetite control cells are damaged and potentially you consume more
6457370 people in the age group of 25 to 50 are most at risk the neurons that tell people in the crucial age range not to over eat are being killed off
6457371 when the stomach is empty it triggers the ghrelin hormone that notifies the brain that we are hungry when we are full a set of neurons known as pomcs kick in
6457372 however free radicals created naturally in the body attack the pomc neurons this process causes the neurons to degenerate overtime affecting our judgement as to when our hunger is satisfied
6457373 a diet rich in carbohydrate and sugar that has become more and more prevalent in modern societies over the last 20 30 years has placed so much strain on our bodies that its leading to premature cell deterioration
6457374 we have known for some time that young and middle aged adults who are overweight run a higher risk of death and it was presumed that this held true for older people in fact our results show that the risk of dying is higher only for the most severely obese but that all older people who are overweight are at significantly increased risk of developing problems with mobility and carrying out everyday tasks
6457375 this research is important because a growing proportion of the population is aged 65 or over and more and more of these older people are overweight in fact in most developed countries middle aged and elderly adults are more likely to be obese than people in any other age group these findings have huge significance for the delivery of health care both now and in the future increasing numbers of older people and higher levels of overweight and obesity will lead to a greater burden of disability and ill health and place an immense strain on health and social services the issue is likely to get worse as time goes on and represents a ticking time bomb for health services around the world
6457376 staying a healthy weight can be a fun and relatively easy thing to do even as people get older
6457377 our experience of running supported walking and cycling groups has shown that older people benefit in many ways from regular physical activity
6457378 people are living longer but this study shows that excess weight can have a real impact on the quality of peoples lives which can reduce the benefit of those extra years
6457379 this report highlights the problem of obesity in an increasingly ageing population
6457380 i believe we have delivered the biggest modernization of the atp tour since its inception have attracted unprecedented levels of investment into mens tennis and have begun to feed the growing appetite for mens tennis globally both in established and emerging markets

6457386 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6457387 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county

6457403 living only five minutes away from the annapolis dinner theatre as it was known in 1990 when it opened
6457404 i really liked working as part of the music hall crew from 1995 until 2000 and again in 2001 for a couple of shows after the national annie tour
6457405 i spent the whole of 2004 at the music hall until it closed we had a lot of fun and there was a certain warmth from everyone

6457429 this is going to go down as a pretty unremarkable summer as far as heat and humidity
6457430 this was designed to compensate for those which makes me expect that it probably is going to have more uniform results the approach to disease is becoming more and more uniform on a national level so youd kind of expect it to come out even
6457431 the expectation is that the quality of care delivered throughout the state should be excellent no matter where you are or what hospital you go to
6457432 to me the most important aspect of all of this is the whole concept of transparency in that we ought to be speaking honestly within institutions and across the country about how do we get the right care for the right patient at the right time every time

6457473 russian war planes are in the skies there tonight and people rightfully so are scared these are some of the sounds and some of the pictures that we have been getting in throughout the course of the evening russia seems to believe that people in south ossetia are their people and that they need defending prime minister vladimir putin today there you see him landing in the middle of this mess with very harsh words for the now democratic government of georgia
6457474 despite the u s urging restraint russia responded with tanks bombs and combat planes after georgia sent troops into a breakaway province along the russian border georgia directed its troops to the south ossetia early friday trying to gain tighter control over the province that attempted to declare its independence in 2006
6457475 each side blamed the other for the outbreak of fighting in the region
6457476 american newspapers have run story after story about how evil russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state many accounts made it seem as though the conflict was started by an aggressive russia invading the georgian territory of south ossetia some said that south ossetias capital tskhinvali was destroyed by the russian army little attention was paid to the chronology of events the facts underlying the conflict
6457477 commentary in the u s media almost without exception has turned a longstanding complex separatist conflict into belli for a new cold war with russia ignoring not only the historical and political reasons for south ossetias drive for independence from georgia but also the responsibility of georgian president mikheil saakashvili for the current crisis so eager have commentators been to indict vladimir putins russia that they have overlooked washingtons contribution to the rising tensions
6457478 both sides had been preparing for war for months if not years with the two historic enemies armed and convinced an attack could come at any time all it needed was a trigger
6457479 push for america to muscle his tiny country of four million into nato
6457480 at the white house president bush bantered with the georgian president about his prowess as a dancer laura bush the first lady took mr saakashvilis wife to lunch mr bush promised him to push hard for georgias acceptance into nato after the meeting mr saakashvili pronounced his visit one of the most successful visits during my presidency and said he did not know of any other leader of a small country with the access to the administration that he had
6457481 foreign officials do occasionally state their views in the post by interview letter or opinion article but these last are invariably signed
6457482 the russian attacks on georgia if left unchecked could easily
6457483 do you recall the precise details of the sudeten crisis that led to nazi germanys invasion of czechoslovakia of course not because that morally ambiguous dispute is rightly remembered as a minor part of a much bigger drama the mood is reminiscent of germany after world war i when germans complained about the shameful versailles diktat imposed on a prostrate germany by the victorious powers and about the corrupt politicians who stabbed the nation in the back
6457484 ive been warning people for a while now that russia is trying to corner the market while everybody is saying oh theyre just waiting for us to lead the way on global warming theyre going and theyre buying all of the carbon reserves that they can get their hands on
6457485 to withdraw its troops and halt the interference in georgian territory this latest act shows the need for greater resolve in establishing a european security system that can be an effective check on russian power
6457486 it is so refreshing to have a sports writer who writes with such verve and intelligence who also has a social conscience and who refuses to keep those parts of his life separate

6457504 if we dont know your father is alive right now if there is only a 90 chance that he is alive right now then there is a chance that you can go back and kill him
6457505 but if you know he is alive there is no chance you can kill him
6457506 you go back to kill your father but youd arrive after hed left the room you wouldnt find him or youd change your mind
6457507 you wouldnt be able to kill him because the very fact that he is alive today is going to conspire against you so that youll never end up taking that path leads you to killing him

6457509 its surprising just how quickly the value of the contents of our luggage adds up its easy to forget the actual value of the suitcase or bag itself and the accumulated value of all its contents may not be fully appreciated particularly if you like designer accessories holidaymakers should check that they have appropriate cover in place for both their holiday plans and their personal belongings before travelling
6457510 up to 200 000 passengers an average a month from the uk have lost their luggage in the past two years but holiday bags may still go missing or be mislaid when travelling in the uk to ensure holidaymakers enjoy a relaxing summer holiday we recommend people check their cover every time they plan to go away regardless of how far or for how long
6457511 paranoia defines the organizing principle of how racism functions in american culture today
6457512 a lot of folks i studied would tell me they couldnt wait to get back to the south once they retired
6457513 they told me there at least you know who is racist and who is not of course it was tongue in cheek but it said a lot about their suspicions
6457514 its whats left over once overt racism has been largely eliminated
6457515 we have made amazing racial progress in this country but we shouldnt think that our endgame is simply to banish racist language
6457516 how many of us actually have friends from a different race
6457517 misunderstandings which happen all the time for lots of reasons
6457518 there are still enough problems which require legal solutions that i think its a mistake to focus on things that are so subtle and ambiguous
6457519 either we find a way to deal with these serious race based skepticisms or we create some strange never never land of post racial living by collective repression
6457520 i was not in the right frame of mind to read it

6457525 you develop very good peripheral vision you know when youve been recognized right on the edge of your vision
6457526 just by someone turning their head very quickly you go ok i know what that is people dont turn their heads that quickly unless they just saw something and im in the vicinity
6457527 then again it might be a pain but its when they stop doing it thats when you have to worry you think is it all going to dry up is the party over

6457540 this research opens doors to potential new approaches to skin cancer diagnosis based on the profile of skin odors hopefully leading to more rapid and non invasive detection and diagnosis of this prevalent disease
6457541 we found a different profile of chemicals above tumor sites relative to healthy skin
6457542 the same chemicals are present but at skin cancer sites some chemicals are increased while others are decreased compared to healthy individuals

6457562 i said no i have to go at this alone i had been controlled so much as an actor on the set youre always controlled by the desires and wishes of the writer director producers the studio and the will of the other actors i needed to step into this field myself

6457580 the approach is employee centered not program centered all five elements are managed as an integrated whole and it is the clearest way an employer can communicate that its employees are an asset
6457581 the approach is to take care of the complete individual
6457582 our role is to identify those with a chronic health issue and to provide services and support to manage the condition and move that person to better health the other emphasis is to get healthy people to stay healthy
6457583 improving the health and well being of the people we serve
6457584 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw

6457601 my recent remarks may have been mistakenly construed as a call to rescind the colorado river compact and commence negotiations for new water allocations
6457602 let me be clear that i do not advocate renegotiation of the compact
6457603 i think the word renegotiate does not have double meaning
6457604 it is about opening it up and negotiating it again and the fact that hes willing to do that again has to demonstrate in my mind given the context of it a bias for the lower basin states his desire still to renegotiate it was really pretty direct
6457605 this is a reversal of direction but its a reversal that i think colorado voters have to pay clear attention to because on the west slope im not sure there are more important issues than the issue of the scarcity of water

6457635 im a winger but the manager wanted me to play off the front man
6457636 i think in the first half we played well we had a lot of chances
6457637 after the second goal from the czechs the direction was not so strong
6457638 the problem is not with the style we played but the difficulty we have when the other team play the counter attack
6457639 it is always dangerous and we have to study this problem
6457640 at this moment the players are not 100 physically and important players like rooney and gerrard have played just one game
6457641 i think this result is important we played against a very strong team and well have more confidence for the next game
6457642 i am a friend of brian but its not my job to comment its a board decision
6457643 maybe we should have won the game with the players we had out
6457644 the crowd were frustrated as theyd paid a lot of money for their tickets and weve got to put on a better show than that

6457656 i hope my fans understand and forgive me we have been working hard for the past four years
6457657 the u s a is a very good team they defend very well
6457658 its surprising to have the u s and brazil in the final im thinking it will be a very difficult game
6457659 he threw a kick and i threw a kick and in my humble opinion i thought it should have been 1 1
6457660 but i respect the judges decision in giving him a point and not me its a subjective sport
6457661 i am going to start training for 2012 and hopefully i will get my gold medal then

6457787 it hasnt been decided yet we are interested in doing them as original science fiction works they were extremely fascinating with these kinds of dramatic story lines i feel that theres a lot we could do potentially
6457788 this past week has been difficult for all of us it is a struggle for me to put my feelings into words because i have so many mixed feelings i feel angry that a person who was associated with our parish although in a very limited way would betray the trust of a child
6457789 the perpetrator of this heinous crime was an independent contractor who agreed to play the piano and direct the adult choir at the 12 30 spanish mass for a modest stipend his relationship with the parish and its members was remote
6457790 unless he was privately contracted to play the piano at a wedding his time on church property was about three hours per week by profession he is a painter and yet all we heard and read in the media was that he was the choir director at st philip benizi catholic church
6457791 i have not been notified that there is any evidence that any abuse took place on parish property nor have i been told that any of the children photographed and molested were from our parish
6457792 the only consolation i have is that pedophilia is a disease it is a dangerous sickness it is an addictive and compulsive pathology
6457793 an emotional and amazing part of the race for everyone
6457794 he was studying for his masters in mechanical engineering at purdue when he was diagnosed he was active at the campus ministry there and fell in love with mission work during trips to haiti
6457795 his illness only strengthened his faith in god and devotion to mary
6457796 he offered all his suffering for women who were considering abortion he taught me what it means to praise god regardless of the circumstances i am blessed to have him as my big brother

6457814 caray is coming home can he make it this will be a close one here comes the slide hes safe listen to that crowd of angels and saints theyre going berserk
6457815 over the three plus years that weve been producing our podcast weve had a few inquiries from different radio stations about the possibility of repackaging the rosary army podcast as a radio program that would be played on regular terrestrial radio
6457816 within a couple days joe sent us an invitation asking us to come to new york to record a three hour demo show in the sirius studios
6457817 they immediately asked us to come back the next week and we recorded another three hour demo but this time the demo was a live national broadcast
6457818 for the past two weeks since we accepted the show we have been going non stop completely changing everything in our house
6457819 in the past week alone i have put together two bunk beds two chairs three desks and installed a new ceiling fan weve repainted three rooms and moved all of our kids around
6457820 when we started rosary army literally everything we had fit into a small wicker basket then we moved everything to the top shelf of a desk in our dining room then we moved it into our closet and now into its own office when we started the podcast we had just a computer and a small microphone then we got a mixer and separate mics then we got better equipment and made the show more professional
6457821 every step of the way we rarely allowed ourselves to dare to look too much forward
6457822 weve learned to be grateful simply to have what god has provided us and our apostolate every step of the way i thought that rosary army might get picked up on a radio station or two but i never dared to dream that something like this would happen it seems that god always teaches us valuable lessons in this case hes showing us that if we just follow his lead he can do anything and take us to even the craziest places including hosting a daily talk show on national radio
6457823 the thing we hear from people time and again from our podcast is that people feel a connection to other catholics and a greater understanding of their faith because of our program
6457824 we want people to love their faith more and that comes through understanding their faith more and by involving themselves in the community of believers in this world whether in their own parishes neighborhoods or even simply online for us we want our show to help people simply enjoy their faith more and as a result to grow closer to god in the process
6457825 were very excited about this new step for rosary army and simply ask people to be praying that well continue to have all the financial resources needed to pay the rent and continue to pay for the myriad of expenses of that apostolate
6457826 we estimate with the need to hire additional employees and other expenses it will continue to cost upward of 75 000 a year to run rosary army so well still be very involved in that apostolate in addition to the talk show simply because we have to keep working to find means of funding the various endeavors of the apostolate
6457827 we asked god that if he doesnt want us to do this or if it would be too much of a hardship on our family that he simply wouldnt let them offer us a job
6457828 instead he opened every door and we have no doubt that this is the path we are supposed to be following we have every confidence that god will provide what we need for our family
6457829 certainly didnt push her son toward trucks and her daughter toward tutus
6457830 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals
6457831 the catholic church is the only thing which saves a man from the degrading slavery of being a child of his age

6457885 we can get a birds eye view of the course and combine that with the golf course materials
6457886 our method allows us to map courses quickly and accurately more importantly we can add courses and make changes more efficiently than our competitors
6457887 we use the most current maps as well as multiple images on a single course to ensure that our points are marked correctly
6457888 many competitors use manual mapping which requires individuals to walk and survey the course this is time consuming and costly as well as inconvenient when course changes are made
6457889 there are rare instances where images are inferior and cannot be used but to have most of the worlds golf courses at our disposal that we can map in a matter of days far outweighs those rare occasions

6457898 i guess i got the name from adults when i was young because they couldnt think of my name at the time
6457899 all of a sudden i became bud i remember the day of my first communion one of my friends alex mccallister said to me after church hey lets go out to the llanerch country club and see if we can caddie i must have been about eight years old at the time we made about 60 cents per round thats how i remember getting into golf
6457900 bud was a tremendous teacher and particularly popular with the women players

6457906 i also got to play with byron nelson in white plains and he hit every drive dead center i remember starting off with a triple bogey on the second hole i came back to birdie 10 11 12 13 14 and 15 nelson said to me after the round why dont you come out and join the tour maybe give it a shot i thought about it but decided that i had to stay home work at the club and raise my children
6457907 sam snead was the strongest and you could not believe how these players could work the woods with whippy shafts but they did you ask me about tiger woods ah hes the best

6457909 it didnt matter if you were young or old he would give tips for nothing he occasionally gets out to give a few lessons and though his legs are weak he can be in a cart and give a great lesson
6457910 i tried to sell it but i ended up giving them away

6457948 the big challenge for the team here at wtg was that we were dealing with a service coming close to the end of its lifecycle we had to deal with end users of the site who were used to the way it works but were migrating from entering claims to their management through the process of settlement the fact that we are able to ensure that the servers and software are supported and maintained for the life of the project while ensuring that solicitors can still access the information for their clients means that we were able to deliver against objective and budget

6458097 the objectives of the delegation will be to reassure ourselves with the work that the local organising committee of the 2010 world cup is doing
6458098 but we also to make sure that when general elections are held next april that the outgoing and the incoming governments are all behind this organisation
6458099 i can tell you that they are able to organise the world cup they will do it there is a movement to say trust south africa to organise the world cup trust them
6458100 when you speak about security in south africa you give me one country in the world where security is at 100 per cent sure it is not possible
6458101 we know that in south africa that its not the best but if you know where the devil is then you know also how to take measures against that

6458104 the uzbeks have got us thinking were going to have to work on our system and our system only and make sure that we can adapt in the first five minutes to whatever gets thrown at us
6458105 its important that we get together now to prepare for what will possibly be our toughest qualifier for the world cup because we go into the unknown against uzbekistan

6458108 he is a bloke who is influential he is a bloke who is inspirational because he does intimidate and blokes alongside him tend to respond to that
6458109 it is good to have him back but most importantly it is good for him
6458110 he didnt enjoy watching the last outing and hopefully he brings that grumpiness with him
6458111 you dont need to read too much into that because the volume of game time wont change just the order
6458112 it is not a reflection of ranking so to speak it is the order we are using this week we will be looking to matty to put the after burners on and well respond to what we see
6458113 it is going to be dry it is going to be fast so that order serves
6458114 we have got versatility in the mix and in terms of covering fullback ryan cross will do that
6458115 he has background in that position and he has done well with each opportunity he has got
6458116 at times there it was obvious we took the wrong option
6458117 a couple of times it was on and we just didnt pull it off so skill execution and wrong options a couple of times there were off but the thing is were having a go its just when to take them weve just got to be a bit more clinical when we do do it
6458118 i think next game weve got to be a bit more dominant with our ball carries and hold the ball longer because it shows in the last few tests whoever holds the ball the longest is usually scoring points so its going to be pretty important for us on the weekend

6458127 gerrard was not playing on the left im sorry we played 4 3 2 1 we played jermain defoe gerrard and wayne rooney and three midfielders behind them
6458128 the position he had to play was between the line of the backs and the midfielders mr redknapp has to say something but he didnt play on the left sorry with his movement he went on the left and to the middle he moved but he never played on the left
6458129 im happy for the draw because the reaction to the team to the last minute was good was important and i think also that the first half we played with good football good style and created a lot of chances to score goals and the team played together with different style
6458130 i think tonight we took another step im happy i saw a lot of things which i had doubts on and the players fitness levels are still not at their best but i think well be ready for both the games next month
6458131 there was only one thing i didnt like in the first half sometimes when the czechs had counter attacks we suffered
6458132 that was the problem we have to prepare something to combat that problem
6458133 i asked to play against them for this reason to see where the problems are they are not easy to beat
6458134 i think overall we expected more from the game but there are some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and analyse them
6458135 maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there and now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the qualifying game against andorra
6458136 hopefully we can build on that and take the positives but things under capello will take time to get right
6458137 the crowd were frustrated and the players fully understand that and we know we have to put on a better show

6458140 i remember doing it with webcke after training hes the hardest bloke ive ever tackled
6458141 i used to go out every friday and try and knock him over hed just stand there off two steps and block me and id fall on my arse that was about it but hes made of granite that bloke
6458142 i was guilty against the all blacks i fell off a few tackles and i was pretty dirty at myself so i dont want that to happen next game so i take pride in the defence and its got to be up there again
6458143 i imagine theyll probably chop and change a little bit there
6458144 de villiers is a very smart sort of player hes pretty nifty and he sort of controls their backline so as a 12 you have to be pretty on your toes to look after him because he obviously along with butch james controls where theyre destined to go in the backline
6458145 what is he six three or six four almost but hes quick too thats the other thing that you often dont see
6458146 im pretty stoked to be here and i dont take it for granted thats for sure
6458147 but the real reason for me coming across here was to play in different countries and to get that opportunity i think thats the greatest thing that rugby offers

6458150 there must be one more precious than others like the falcon among the birds the camel among all beasts of burden the palm among he trees and the sun among the stars
6458151 within these walls find what you seek and do not leave without it
6458152 i think maybe missing out on the world cup squad was something i took not hard but it was a big disappointment to me
6458153 i think everyone you see that plays rugby has a disappointment in their career they dont make a team they dont make a squad
6458154 that was something that i sort of sat down after and sort of said look its now or never not now or never but its time for me to step up
6458155 it was clean slate everyone was on a new piece of paper
6458156 obviously discipline was a part of my game that i lacked
6458157 i tended to have brain explosions or brain snaps where id do something stupid that probably at the time i thought was a good idea but you look back and it wasnt
6458158 so that was something that i have worked pretty hard on not actually physically doing anything but logically in my head trying to work that out
6458159 i just sort of said if it seems stupid at the time its probably not a good idea to do it
6458160 you can overcomplicate rugby it is just a game after all and you just go out there and do what you do do what you can do and do it to your best ability and thats all ive been really trying to do and robbie hasnt tried to change anything
6458161 i sort of went into this super 14 season wanting to play my best for the reds and hopefully that would sort of continue into a squad
6458162 when i first got called up it was something that was a pleasing surprise and each week has just been an added bonus to me but each week i want to make the best of my opportunities and now that im here i definitely dont want to give it up
6458163 each guy can do a job when theyre there weve got guys that arent in the squad that could definitely do the job and if i get given the opportunity i plan to do it to the best of my ability and do it as well as i can so that next week im still there with the job
6458164 i think weve got a very young bunch of guys there but theres a group of guys that want to be there and want to play and have the ability to play well
6458165 i think thats something that weve probably lacked in queensland a little bit self belief and i think to bring those young guys to have a bit of self belief to show that they can mix it with the likes of the other big super 14 franchises is going to be a challenge but it will be enjoyable
6458166 apart from the 74 500 spectators and the tv audience you mean
6458167 did you watch munster v toulouse in the hc final
6458168 losing vickerman elsom and lyons is a really really big hole in that waratah forward pack let alone the waratah team
6458169 thats something that really we need to focus on and its an opportunity for other guys to step up so thats a challenge
6458170 the waratahs do need to replace those guys and theres a fine line there youll have some good young talent and its whether or not theyre ready
6458171 the relaxation of being able to look at some other players overseas certainly gives you that option of bringing in maybe some seniority which ushers through the junior guys
6458172 what i saw from slightly arms length but i did spend a bit of time with the tahs this year was a pretty good values system if you like within the team
6458173 theres no substituing that experience but at the same time i think what you will have is younger guys stepping into a group that has a history of the right sort of mentality going into seasons and thats going to be helpful
6458174 i dont think you ever leave a job feeling like its all done youre always looking at whats next and how to improve
6458175 i was offered the job initially for two years to the world cup and i said look what im seeing its going to take three years for discernible change
6458176 on finishing the job my attitude is from now to the end of the year theres still a lot of improvement to be sought and gained but you walk away saying what ive promised ive hopefully delivered
6458177 apart from the 74 500 spectators and the tv audience you mean

6458216 its way too early to know which if any of these technologies is going to be practical
6458217 but its important for us to get ahead of the curve soldiers are always on the cutting edge of new technologies
6458218 in situations where it is important to win the hearts and minds of the local populace it would be useful to know if they understand the information being given them
6458219 its also important to develop antidotes and protective agents against various classes of drugs
6458220 how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands
6458221 i think most reasonable people if they imagine a world in which all sides have figured out how to control brains theyd rather not go there
6458222 most rational human beings would believe that if we could have a world where nobody does military neuroscience well all be better off but for some people in the pentagon its too delicious to ignore
6458223 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that some day there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects
6458224 experiments indicate that the advantages of these devices are such that human operators will be greatly enhanced for things like photo reconnaissance and so on
6458225 in the intelligence community there is an extremely small number of people who understand the science and without that its going to be impossible to predict surprises this is a black hole that needs to be filled with light

6458240 california led the way into our culture of car dependence so it is only appropriate that the state lead the way out
6458241 if you look at the no 99 b line you see people missing a couple or three buses before a bus comes thats actually able to take them
6458242 were negotiating with all our banks and every house is a case by case basis
6458243 this is just the direction that sterling chose to go it caught us by surprise
6458244 many people who would never throw for instance a plastic bag on the ground would go ahead and toss a cigarette butt on the ground and step on it and leave it there
6458245 because theres no nutritional value when an animal eats a cigarette butt or several cigarette butts they feel full and can actually starve to death
6458246 the mothers genescontribute more to the development of the thinking or executivecentres of the brain while paternal genes have a greater impact on thedevelopment of the emotional limbic brain
6458247 some imprinted genes work only if they come from themother
6458248 the same gene issilenced if it is inherited via the sperm rather than the egg
6458249 androgenetic mouse embryos died because certain vital genes had been switched off by the donor father
6458250 as the embryos matured cells that carriedonly paternal genes accumulated in clusters scattered throughout theemotional brain the hypothalamus the amygdala
6458251 cellscontaining only maternal genes were absent from the emotional brain instead they selectively accumulated in the brains executive region the seat of higher cognitive intelligence

6458258 the fact is oregon is part of the larger regional national and really global animal
6458259 slower levels of economic growth and likely recession mean demand for oregon goods tends to dissipate theres less spending around the country and really around the globe
6458260 were pretty busy right now with shipments to japan and were going into a new line of fixtures
6458261 the normal display opportunities are not there there are not as many people opening stores in some cases people have purchased displays and not too much later they close down which is unusual
6458262 for the industry as a whole as far as display its not a really strong market
6458263 its down about 60 to 65 percent from the peak of around 2005 2006 theres just too many houses now on the market that people want to sell
6458264 the commodity business is really weak prices of random lengths material are about as low as its been

6458270 the gop republican party of today bears no resemblance to lincoln teddy roosevelt or eisenhowers party or many of the other republican administrations that came after that
6458271 my decision came at the end of last week when it was demonstrated to the nation that mccain and this bush white house have learned little in the last five years

6458279 our results show that hot flushes night sweats sleeplessness and joint pains were less common in women on hrt in this age group
6458280 sexuality was also improved overall quality of life measures improved even when women did not have hot flushes and were well past menopause there was a small but measurable improvement in quality of life and a noted improvement in sleep sexuality and joint pains

6458282 there was no relationship between my leaving and the possibility the audit would say something negative
6458283 i felt like we did fine i didnt think we needed to tighten procedures we did a good job selecting projects and stayed within the procedures established by the metro council
6458284 to a great degree we try to utilize a small amount of public money to leverage a fairly substantial private investment and to guide the development in a way to meet a public policy goal
6458285 rrepeated investments with the same developer can make the tod program dependent on that developers success

6458293 really this is the continuing story of our immigrant country
6458294 and just like those before them these new immigrants will give us the same gifts of hard work innovation determination to make a better life and all the cultural riches the food the music
6458295 weve got to stop this immigration chain once someone comes they bring their 400 relatives
6458296 the environment cant take it weve only so much land and the country is not growing in size
6458297 our curriculum hasnt changed the system of educators administrators the entire culture hasnt changed to reflect the changing demographics since a time back when 5 percent of students were ethnic minorities
6458298 the system discourages them from continuing their education and the state is missing out on this vital human resource
6458299 its a gift anymore to have a legislator who can really dig into a complex issue and be able to mete out a fair deal the stuff that people used to do up here that make things work
6458300 when you look at the scope of the bill its pretty significant
6458301 one issue everyone has been afraid to touch is land use
6458302 everyone understands about using alternative fuel but land use has been the third rail ab 32 changed the equation because now land use has to be part of the solution to global warming you cant meet our goal just with alternative fuels you have to reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled
6458303 if people are going to drive and they are going to drive we need to plan in ways to get them out of their cars faster that means shrinking not the amount of housing not economic development not growth but shrinking the footprint on which that growth occurs
6458304 weve had two great exports from germany sauerkraut and the feed in tariff
6458305 germany has pole vaulted over other countries when it comes to clean energy technology and thats gotten peoples attention
6458306 the big energy companies have too many vested interests in sticking with conventional energy sources
6458307 it used to be only idealists were interested in solar
6458308 but now theres money to be made from the sun
6458309 if you force utilities to pay heavily subsidized above market rates somebody will have to pick up the tab and its going to be customers
6458310 this is the sharpest tool in the toolbox because its the most effective in driving investment into renewable energy
6458311 it also promises the tremendous side effect of making america competitive in green technology but we have to act soon because there isnt much time to lose
6458312 let me start over my name is tanya extending hand whats yours
6458313 ill give you 40 for it get off the bike and follow me home where i have the money
6458314 at the inverness airport having left her own car at glasgow airport she hired a car and

6458323 wheel weights have been identified as the largest new route of lead releases into the environment
6458324 by moving the industry away from leaded wheel weights we are helping to keep the lead out of our kids drinking water
6458325 we are pleased that the court has approved settlement of this matter so that we can move forward with our aggressive plans to eliminate the use of lead wheel weights in our products
6458326 by the end of this month we expect that all of the vehicles we produce will be equipped with wheel weights made from alternate materials 11 months ahead of the schedule set in the settlement agreement in california
6458327 for environmental reasons this is the direction the industry is going
6458328 we fully expect dozens of states to follow californias leadership and ban the use of lead wheel weights
6458329 our solution to the problem was a social enterprise kitchen
6458330 if you have a structural deficit why are you spending more money on food
6458331 processed stuff is much cheaper but youre not seeing the full cost
6458332 good foods are not the privilege of people who have money its the right of everybody
6458333 when we buy wholesale local and fresh we get a better product for a good price its the right way to do business
6458334 wed like to see them scale up to a full system beyond just tests sooner rather than later
6458335 the difference is we have molasses that degrades very quickly or oil that dissolves very slowly but provides enough dissolved material to feed the bacteria to do the same job
6458336 using vegetable oil it was definitely effective it just didnt have easy distribution they wanted throughout the aquifer

6458340 esto es lo que la barrick gold hace con sus trabajadores ofrecimientos y compromisos que nunca se hacen realidad
6458341 de esa manera mantener su imagen de empresa responsable adem s de indemnizar con migajas
6458342 se denuncie lo que hacen las empresas inescrupulosas como barrick ya que lo nico que les interesa es sacar el oro que existe en nuestra cordillera a costa de lo que sea y al menor costo econ mico posible
6458343 desde que se iniciaron los trabajos de exploraci n de pascua lama hasta la actualidad hemos tenido que lamentar siete accidentes con consecuencias fatales
6458344 se han debido a la falta de seguimiento de procedimientos espec ficos de prevenci n y seguridad por parte de las v ctimas
6458345 lo que hemos conocido de pascua lama ha sido una suma de enga os de ocultamiento de informaci n de omisiones y de falsedades
6458346 c mo le otorgan un premio si declaran no tener a nadie trabajando es absurdo
6458347 la actividad en el rea del proyecto pascua lama ces de manera significativa en el a o 2000
6458348 se paraliza toda faena relacionada con este proyecto quedando en forma permanente s lo 4 personas en el campamento de barriales a cargo del mantenimiento y protecci n del lugar as como del control de los caminos de acceso
6458349 eran los nicos que andaban trabajando arriba y tienen un accidente por qu no publican eso tambi n
6458350 ya no solo son los glaciares los riesgos de la contaminaci n de las fuentes de agua si no tambi n a eso hay que sumar el poco aporte socio econ mico que estas empresas hacen al pa s y a las regiones donde se instalan
6458351 todo constituye una suma en que el resultado final es absolutamente negativo para la comunidad y el pa s
6458352 opening this up to 3rd party development allows for a potentially rich user experience plenty of apps but with a
6458353 the difficulty with getting a good user experience both from distribution to use with applications across all these platforms is nearly insurmountable in my opinion and the cost of building to try to allow this good user experience across a myriad of java handsets along with symbian ms mobile etc is prohibitive the business models just dont make much sense
6458354 n o fazes tu outro h disposto a fazer isso
6458355 propose adopt and submit to epa for approval and implement regulations no later than jan 1 2008 to achieve the emission reduction goals
6458356 it necessarily follows that the district court also lacked jurisdiction to impose remedies based on the alleged deficiency in the baseline methodology
6458357 while we acknowledge that the baseline is a critical foundation this does not change our view that neither the baseline nor the methodology qualify as independently enforceable aspects of the
6458358 nor would the district court have jurisdiction to hold in effect that the epa improperly approved an invalid plan because it lacked enforceable emission standards
6458359 ich m chte betonen dass dieser sturm eine ernste hochwasserlage ausgel st hat
6458360 am anfang einer saison wird gern alles berbewertet ich lese nie etwas von methodischen ver nderungen immer nur ber architektonische
6458361 eigentlich interessiert es mich nicht was st ndig ber das aufeinandertreffen von mir und j rgen geschrieben wird das hat auch f r das spiel mit sicherheit keine relevanz
6458362 wir haben kein duell es gibt immer eine gro e wertsch tzung ich w nsche ihm erfolg nur nicht am samstag
6458363 und wir wollen f r die bayern wieder ein m glichst unangenehmer gegner sein
6458364 schmelzer ist schnell und aggressiv wenn ein spieler den n chsten schritt machen kann geht manchmal ein knopf auf
6458365 wir gehen mit der denkweise nach dortmund dass wir danach vier punkte auf dem konto haben
6458366 ich f hle mich fit und hoffe dass ich spielen kann ich will das adrenalin sp ren
6458367 i can kind of understand where rogge is coming from however it is not as if it was a photo finish the guy was back in his warm up kit after doing a lap and signing autographs before the others had crossed the line to then go say well done is probably more of a put down
6458368 its more special because im doing it with my best mate of 25 years to cross the line after all weve been through it just adds so much more to it
6458369 we knew wed win this time because we wanted it more than anyone else
6458370 i got up at 12 and my masseur brought me some nuggets
6458371 i came straight to the track and my masseuse again brought me more nuggets i just had two though because my coach was saying i shouldnt eat so much nuggets before the race
6458372 he still has to mature he is a young man but he should show more respect for his rivals that would be more in the spirit of the olympic ideal
6458373 he should shake hands with them after the finish line i have no problems with his showboating prior to the race but a shake of the hand or a tap on the shoulder immediately after the race would be a good gesture
6458374 theres so much pressure on here what with the training and not seeing the family anyone who works away from home will tell you they dont like being away now i can live a normal boys life for a while
6458375 i like swimming from the front but that last lap was a real struggle and the final section was a blur
6458376 i was delirious but the stretcher at the end was a bit mad i just wanted to lie down and have a sleep
6458377 i predicted new orleans would come back as a stronger and better city we helped deliver 126 billion in taxpayer money
6458378 who would have thought three years after the storm the president could come and say
6458379 i think the message here today is hope is being restored hope is coming back
6458380 let no one suffer the illusion that 126 billion has gone straight to where it is needed and where it belongs
6458381 everything must go were slashing prices on tons of films we acquired bargain basement prices
6458382 sie haben uns ber die entscheidung des russischen verteidigungsministeriums informiert die milit rische zusammenarbeit mit den nato staaten bis auf weiteres auszusetzen
6458383 weder das management noch die leistungstr ger m chten sich an diesem au erordentlich niedrigen kurs bereichern
6458384 he is wonderful preparing and drinking his tea but he is painfully and disagreeably human
6458385 the national census is out of date too costly and should be scrapped immediately a think tank has claimed
6458386 the number of migrants coming to the uk for a year or more has risen to a record level figures show
6458387 the price of a powerball ticket remains unchanged at 1 even though our players know that the cost of everything else has gone up since powerball sales commenced over 16 years ago we didnt want to raise powerballs price in our current economy

6458509 heavy marine traffic in the sydney area could interfere with the mothers ability to hear and locate her calf thats a possibility
6458510 a boat could have physically come between the mother and her calf and cause the separation as well a recreational vessel for example
6458511 calves could have been separated from their mother in a storm they could have been separated by the mother being attacked by orca killer whales or sharks it could be sonar destruction through vessels it could have just been bad luck
6458512 calves generally stay within two or three body lengths of their mother and if a calf strays beyond that we frequently watch mothers immediately respond to get them back
6458513 the bond between the mother and the calf is so intense that youd have to imagine that something has occurred that forced the separation other than abandonment even if the calf is sick
6458514 when calves do get separated the mothers do get stressed and they go searching for them
6458515 if the calf is born while travelling north and this is not uncommon this adds to the risk of potential separation because the mother is not likely to stop out in the open ocean because there are things that could hurt her such as the orca whales
6458516 shed be trying to get that calf up to the sheltered waters of the reef

6458527 hay tramos ciegos pero en teor a las banderas amarillas tendr an que ayudar en caso de que en una curva que no pudieras ver a la salida si hay alguien parado
6458528 del mismo modo continu hay partes que se estrechan bastante como la zona del puente pero son los riesgos y trampas que tiene todo circuito urbano m naco no permite ning n error y valencia pese a ser m s ancho menos bacheado y estar todo m s calculado no va a permitir tampoco errores esa es la salsa de los circuitos urbano
6458529 a trescientos kil metros por hora va a cambiar mucho respecto a las sensaciones al caminarlo hoy se va a volver todo m s estrecho y m s dif cil pero as a priori es de esos circuitos que te gustan bien preparado todo calculado a estrenar todo nuevo

6458627 were excited to open another hotel with the new candlewood suites exterior

6458630 at my company we are putting our money where our mouth is by creating this summer a new hotel finance program designed to help creative financing solutions
6458631 many hotel transactions are mired in macroeconomic doldrums but we must find ways to break out of this situation because we are beginning to see some pent up market demand
6458632 the debt shortage in the hotel industry is not serious enough to produce the sort of foreclosures we saw in the s amp l debacle of the 90s and current debt is being serviced though there is little room for slippage there is hope and some signs that private capital pools will help stimulate transactions taking up the slack from an almost non existent cmbs market and anemic banks
6458633 when sellers come to terms with the fact that their properties may not be worth what they were during the recent boom market we have to manage the unrealistic expectations
6458634 securing adequate capital is the primary issue today that determines whether a hotel deal succeeds or fails
6458635 with our new program we are moving aggressively to help our clients transact business we are rounding out the suite of services that the pkf family of companies offers from consulting hospitality research through brokerage
6458636 in order to close todays sales transactions timely and efficient sourcing of hotel debt is essential
6458637 our hotel finance program provides pkfs clients with financing opportunities for long term short term or bridge financing as well as
6458638 gives pkf the ability to prescreen finance deals with preliminary or soft quotes on acquisition financing so that both buyer and sellers can confidently go forward with the sales closing process
6458639 i am eager to take on the new challenges ahead of me in this new position
6458640 everyone at the mumford company has done a great job mentoring me during my time as a sales analyst and i feel very prepared to transition into my new role
6458641 its menstrual blood she wants us to clean it off
6458642 i think that we need a report to see the amount of calls that are made by the members of the police service to bars and nightclubs
6458643 we not only attend bars to evict people or for fights
6458644 friday and saturday night last week we actually did routine checks of all the beverage rooms in the city
6458645 to say theyre actually drinking in the bars and then wandering around outside wouldnt be fair for me to say

6458661 were achieving great performance with strong prospects in all of northcotts business lines
6458662 weve been doing very well in recent years and are doing relatively well in 2008 even in the midst of a soft economy we believe that northcott hospitality is well positioned for current conditions and beyond
6458663 our decision to seek a buyer is not a business decision its a financial and estate planning one
6458664 in early 2008 the trust that controls 100 percent of our parent company decided that it was in the best interests of its beneficiaries to diversify their personal assets that decision has led to this effort to sell northcott hospitality international
6458665 americinn has a solid track record of growth and a pipeline of hotel projects in development
6458666 we have a great franchisee community and our investment in a strong system wide reservations system is a valuable asset most importantly though we have a sustainable unique marketing advantage with our americinn soundguard construction that makes our hotel properties demonstrably quieter than others
6458667 the vast majority of economists agree that capitalism is the most sound system there is for producing wealth and responding to demand
6458668 we are excited to bring the sophistication of the kimpton boutique brand to the los angeles travel market with the launch of the hotel palomar
6458669 our amenities exemplary service and unique approach to business leisure and entertainment groups will set us apart as one of the finest destinations on the westside
6458670 the milk available at shows was getting to be substandard
6458671 its very important because the event is funded from milk if we have low quality milk and it isnt sold its very detrimental for the show
6458672 we want the consumer to know that this exists and we want tourists to know so that when they come and visit they can have local flavour
6458673 we want them to experience the local produce local baked goods
6458674 id rather if they were picked yesterday compared to picked three weeks ago and put in a truck
6458675 it takes a little initiative around here there are several plots of land that were used for farming now theyre just bare someone with the right initiative and the will they can definitely get some land
6458676 it depends on the size of the operation also how big of an operation do they have maybe they should consider expanding somewhat expanding their product line
6458677 it takes a few years to develop and get more space but you know i think there definitely would be a market
6458678 the fact of the matter is we would love to put local on but we have no local guys coming here saying why dont you buy our stuff
6458679 not one in six years has come through the doors and said look what ive got to sell you
6458680 im tired of chasing people yeah i want to promote your product but here i am usually if you have a product you have to sell it you cant have people chasing you all the time for it at one point you kind of get tired
6458681 people have been told they can only grow cabbage turnip and potatoes
6458682 nobody really tried anything different the first year that we grew corn we had people coming who had never seen corn grow before
6458683 its really hard to get anywhere with the department of agriculture
6458684 its hard to do anything with them i dont think they have a lot of faith in the ability of people to grow things like when i first started with the grapes i was told forget it they will not grow here and now theyre here and theyre here year after year and i get a beautiful crop
6458685 the only one i supplied was alex because he starts with fresh ingredients
6458686 the others they dont not that im aware of if there were more restaurants demanding that i would definitely do it
6458687 i had some tourists who said oh you actually do grow produce in newfoundland and labrador
6458688 every restaurant they went to they had frozen vegetables there they werent very pleased with it
6458689 the elderly people have grown up with carrots potatoes turnips and of course onions and thats what theyre used to and then their kids unless theyve tried them dont have much interest in it
6458690 most of what i grow is the old fashioned stuff
6458691 thats the biggest demand i got the market is not big enough
6458692 when you go in and taste a tomato in a store it tastes disgusting and then you taste a tomato that youve grown and its just phenomenal
6458693 it has to be education when i was growing lettuce my lettuce were big and green and i had several people tell me thats not what lettuce is supposed to look like because they had seen these little white things in the store and they told me what i was growing wasnt right
6458694 but you will see the change it may not happen as quickly as they think it should but i think people are starting to get their head around a different variety of produce
6458695 we are not aware of any blue green algae at this time
6458696 we are always looking for it blue green algae and we havent had problems in the past
6458697 the southern prairie region has more favorable conditions for algal bloom such as shallower stagnant bodies of water and higher nutrient levels
6458698 most of the lakes are deeper and colder than what would make ideal conditions for blue green algae bloom
6458699 the investor class is buying back oil as a hedge because the value of the dollar is weak
6458700 all else equal people would think that in a stable commodity market and a negative financial market people would have more faith in the commodity place
6458701 if the dollar does fall off a lot of these guys foreign investors are able to consume more and buy more on a pure dollar per dollar basis
6458702 running back to gold running back to oil so it seems we are seeing some of the running back to safe haven
6458703 running back to oil as a hedge against this risk again
6458704 the risk factors are back on the rise with the latest fears about fannie mae and freddie mac and that seems to have captured the imagination of the market
6458705 the reason why gas supplies are so tight is because refineries are not making any demand is not there
6458706 the summer driving season is coming to an end and if the refineries chose to they could ramp up the production of gas because they have plenty of crude but there is no desire to ramp up
6458707 we are going up for the same reasons we went to the highs concerns about the dollar the economy the feds ability to raise interest rates
6458708 it looks like we could potentially test the 120 area that would be the big number that everybody would be looking at
6458709 we believe that raids on the immigrant community are unjust unnecessary and counterproductive
6458710 we urge the federal government to fully respect the well founded principles of conscientious objection
6458711 as an agency ice is responsible for enforcing the immigration and customs laws enacted by congress
6458712 its the worst thing that happened in our lifetime and we consider ourselves patriotic americans yet america has become a joke to the world in certain circles
6458713 part of this concept was to show that just because some factions of the government are doing certain things it doesnt mean that everyone in america is bad or everyone supports exactly what is going on its been embarrassing at times and i think this movie is in some ways our reaction to whats gone on
6458714 we dont feel that the film is making any massive political statement were not even saying that its good or bad that guantanamo bay exists were just saying that itd gotta suck if you went there right
6458715 these touchy subjects are usually the perfect thing for comedy we grew up loving that type of social satire and as long as you keep it juvenile enough south park enough and you have a bottomless party in it then you can joke about george w bush and guantanamo bay
6458716 as un pc as the movie gets its not mean spirited
6458717 it does the opposite by including everyone in the movie and thats what makes it a joy to play
6458718 thats why hayden and jon much like harold and kumar get away with so much its really quite wide eyed and innocent yes we have a bottomless party but its like a 13 year old kind of perviness not adult pervyness
6458719 well have young ones who will have to be peeled from their parents and thats ok
6458720 well have youngsters wholl run up and yell ya hoo and thats ok too
6458721 but parents dont you yell ya hoo until youre out of the building
6458722 i do have to say we were disappointed with the democrats
6458723 he was frosty at first he felt betrayed when she dumped him for his friend lance but after a while he caved in and has been sweet to her
6458724 its retaliation were guilty of being within a reasonable proximity of a nuzzi
6458725 nobody said i would like you to lie about tom nuzzi
6458726 the district will defend itself and we believe we will prevail
6458727 that type of clerical support was excessive and an adjustment had to be made
6458728 the devil of company d because of his daring and bravery
6458729 as long as there is a monument on his grave they wouldnt do anything
6458730 three gentlemen were very interested in the letters and the medal and they sent me to the armory to see reuben moreno
6458731 i dont think i did anything out of the ordinary
6458732 as a vietnam veteran myself i was very proud to do it
6458733 i think we took a lot of people by surprise when we said we actually had a new record
6458734 people were starting to say when are you gonna start doing it
6458735 and if it didnt count it didnt get through its been very difficult choosing the singles to be honest
6458736 thats a great problem its not like people going ok thats the one i like and pushing all the other ones to the side
6458737 connies an amazing singer and the album wasnt conducive to any rapping as such thats how it is
6458738 the songs always tell you what to do i think they just sort of went in that direction just suited more this electronic melodic sorta vibe when we do it live things evolve
6458739 shes out the front sketching down things doing her homework at the last second but that kind of really works sometimes its very fresh and you dont question it other times its a bit more thought out
6458740 one is sort of oh shivers im in trouble id better get this done
6458741 squeezed under pressure some people deliver a bit gordon ramsay you know what i mean
6458742 this is the best part the very very best part
6458743 i dunno that latter lyric just seemed like the natural thing to say at that point didnt it
6458744 australia is without question the least pretentious place on earth but i like humour in music like the presets theyre the funniest guys ever and it comes through in their music like they take the piss totally camp it up theyre not gay but every other songs about loving boys its so funny
6458745 for those seeking a vacation home alternative in the bahamas the ritz carlton club provides a lifestyle like no other
6458746 it affords a carefree home ownership experience complete with a staff of dedicated ladies and gentlemen to assist members with their every need this island destination and specifically the abaco club is the ideal setting to expand our growing brand
6458747 the key ingredient to this new concept is member feedback
6458748 our members told us they are looking for enhanced flexibility when using their second homes as a result we designed a program as diverse as their travel plans
6458749 paulson has made it crystal clear that he stands behind that debt
6458750 gse papers rates always presupposed a federal guarantee those tight spreads made no sense based on their stand alone financials now that guarantee is being tested and the government has blinked any wonder the market is spooked
6458751 campaign finance reform booster scuttles it for cash obambi no more
6458752 johnson boo boo shows he can screw up on his own
6458753 quando criamos o prouni tinha um tipo de gente que fazia discurso assim contra o governo
6458754 a tinha um tipo de estudante daqueles que voc s sabem que vai para a reitoria querer bater no reitor
6458755 ah 18 alunos muita gente na sala de aula 18 alunos vai atrapalhar a educa o
6458756 eu digo todo dia governo para todos n o discrimino ningu m mas fa o como a minha m e se eu tiver um bife n o tem um filho mais bonito que vai comer sozinho n o todos v o dar uma lambidinha
6458757 a pol tica econ mica estabelecida neste pa s nos ltimos 40 anos fez gerar duas gera es de jovens sem oportunidades
6458758 porque economista uma beleza quando economista oposi o ele tem solu o para tudo quando ele chega no governo n o tem solu o para nada
6458759 se os jogadores da sele o ol mpica tivessem a mesma garra que os estudantes do prouni a gente teria agora que disputar medalha no domingo
6458760 the film business was a decadent decaying empty whorehouse and it had to be assaulted
6458761 you had that student film mentality lets pick up the banner of godard and walk in there and take over
6458762 it was an audience that had been politicized by vietnam and watergate whose consciousness had been changed with drugs
6458763 the filmmakers who influenced me the most i dont know their names because i would go see a film hate it and say ive got to remember
6458764 i heard about four pops and i thought maybe somebody was playing with fireworks but it was too loud for fireworks
6458765 he came out of the door he run down the stairs
6458766 its just really sad its just a few days before school starts and she has to go to the hospital and get stitches and theyre all upset
6458767 i wanted to destroy the car without crashing it or exploding it
6458768 weve seen that so many times and it wasnt something i wanted to do but i did want to express that feeling of ambivalence so many people have towards their cars
6458769 the guy at my garage told me i should be using it more but im worried about the environment and the price of petrol
6458770 cars offer us freedom but theyre also a kind of cage it feels to me like the car has reached a moment of crisis
6458771 i spent a lot of time sitting next to parramatta road inhaling the fumes and hearing all that noise
6458772 when the drivers saw me with a camera some of them thought i was a cop you get some annoying comments some people even mooned us as they passed
6458773 its also quite cinematic the thing about video projection is that its an impure medium it has elements of cinema performance electronic art and painting its a vessel where all these forms and rich histories can be contained
6458774 there have been at least three generations of video artists in australia
6458775 it has a longer history than most people realise but i guess it has come of age in the last 10 years its become cheaper and more accessible for artists and museums now have the facilities to deal with the technology
6458776 its now sitting in a bad state in the street outside my place in leichhardt
6458777 its probably fixable but i dont think its worth repairing
6458778 alsjeblieft trek een andere broek aan of doe een langer shirt aan
6458779 ik had de zenuwen dus ik heb een paar druppels gelekt
6458780 the internet is just a world passing around notes in a classroom
6458781 hes been a lot of help to me ever since he went down
6458782 hes definitely on my back all the time its starting to get annoying hes in my ear more than secondary coach dave campo more than the coach
6458783 that shows a lot of class a lot of guys wouldnt do that
6458784 the day he went down he came back to practice from doing treatment and he has stayed on me ever since then
6458785 has shown he can play he needs to play some more
6458786 he has great feet good technique its all about going out getting a feel getting some reps and having himself feel comfortable out there
6458787 once he does that hes going to be one of the best corners in the league
6458788 it makes me feel real good a receiver of that caliber praising me and just saying good things
6458789 definitely it makes me want to go out there and work hard it shows a lot of people are believing in me not just on the defensive side it builds up my confidence more than it is
6458790 i learned after the game when i got schooled on that in the end zone that once the quarterback rolls out of the pocket i can pretty much steer the receiver where i want to
6458791 on some players youd worry because he didnt start out well in the game had some problems
6458792 but mike jenkins is a competitor he keeps competing and he doesnt get down on himself he has some confidence
6458793 i think it was good he played against top competition and had some troubles because then he can go back and look at it
6458794 first and foremost the blog helps explain the very complex set of products services and events that make up the lifeway worship project
6458795 second it aggregates worship talk on the web pointing people to posts on other blogs and news sites regarding worship
6458796 the intent is to actively demonstrate that our section of lifeway isnt only interested in making resources
6458797 were interested in the dialogue that is occurring about the practice and theology of worship in the 21st century
6458798 the benefit of the blog is keeping the church informed about trends and preserving the integrity of worship in a changing world
6458799 the result is an informed group of worship leadership that can take new ideas and apply them to their congregations to equip their worshippers and ultimately grow the kingdom of god
6458800 we give tips on how to improve your marriage offer movie reviews provide updates on lifeways marriage events information on marriage resources to use in small group settings as well as experiential thoughts and research
6458801 i think people gravitate toward this type of interaction because its a different form of interaction its real and authentic
6458802 sharing what god is revealing to you about himself and discussing cultural insights into things that are happening currently in the world around you is something everyone can participate in
6458803 michelle ma belle sont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble tres bien ensemble
6458804 michelle ma belle some say monkeys play piano well play piano well
6458805 its all right its ok you may look the other way
6458806 its all right its ok you make love the other way
6458807 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6458808 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county
6458809 if it was a category 1 2 or 3 hurricane making a direct hit on jacksonville youd have something
6458810 this is the first day we can actually see the tops of the roads
6458811 were pulling in our plants and porch furniture making sure we have our supplies and gas for the generator
6458812 i still think we all need to stay on our toes
6458813 di vi no parece que lo hicieron justo para vos adem s te queda apretadito como se usa
6458814 the purpose of the blog was to have real conversations with the curriculums end users the teachers
6458815 my posts arent earth shattering they are based on the lesson in the study materials for that week im not re teaching the lesson but sharing personal stories or what god has been teaching me that relates to that weeks lesson
6458816 coming from the outside lifeway world i know what it is like to have no personal connection with lifeway
6458817 on the blog i hope i come across as being authentic while building credibility by putting myself out there
6458818 we used a few short term bible studies first from threads then migrated to lifematters
6458819 i visit the threads website often just for information and articles about teaching young adults and i just accidentally found this particular blog now that ive found it i rely on it each week
6458820 it makes me feel better to have another piece of material to pull from another example or illustration to talk about
6458821 sometimes i read the whole blog word for word to the class other times i just paraphrase or work it into my normal teaching
6458822 i e mail my class about twice a week with tidbits of information about the lesson or just life and i frequently use the blog material or parts of it in my e mail i like that its real life stuff that these young people can relate to even me at 40 something years old
6458823 this is the third quarter we are using the material and our study sessions have become ripe with meaningful discussions and connecting gods word to our young adults everyday lives
6458824 i check it out weekly to see what insights have been added regarding that weeks bible study
6458825 it gives some unique insight as i prepare for each weeks bible study the comments oftentimes clarify what it is god really wants us to get out of the material for that week

6458828 the resume is a key component of any business school application yet many applicants fail to tailor this document to the admissions process our guide has been forged from clear admit
6458829 clear admit does an excellent job in helping prospective applicants learn about individual schools through the school guides providing great information about specific programs in the context of how they compare to other schools on similar metrics
6458830 by bringing together student opinion official statistics and original research the lbs school guide offers an authentic snapshot of life in our program the cross school analysis presented in the guide is invaluable for candidates who are looking to go beyond rankings and understand the nuances of leading programs
6458831 this award confirms the role a powerful lead management solution can play in bridging the gap between marketing and sales to help companies take a more complete approach toward customer relationship management

6458839 cest naturellement un grand soulagement j tais super nerveuse au d part je suis pass travers mon genou j tais concentr e sur ma ligne droite et lorsque jai d marr je suis pass e travers mon genou ce qui fait quau lieu de me relever au fur et mesure je me suis mise directement toute droite je pensais que c tait fini mais jai quand m me tout donn lorsque jai pass le relais elodie jai d my reprendre deux fois nous tions presque la fin de la zone relais pour le reste tout sest bien d roul chez chacune et je pense que sans cette petite faute nous nous serions qualifi s pour la finale avec un temps tr s proche de notre record de belgique 42 75 je nai rien senti par contre de ma petite blessure au pied
6458840 je suis tr s contente lorsque jai pass la ligne jai r agi comme si j tais d j championne olympique les trois derniers jours nont pas t faciles mais finalement tout sest bien pass je nai rien vu des s ries du 200 m mais jai par contre regard la finale pour la finale de demain nous ne devons pas trop penser une m daille parce que ce serait trop de pression pour nous nous devons nous focaliser sur nous m mes notre temps d montre que nous sommes en forme comme c tait le cas aux mondiaux dosaka lan dernier ndlr o elles d croch rent le bronze aujourdhui c tait une kim 100 donc je suis contente davoir fait le choix de laisser tomber le 200 m
6458841 ce chrono est excellent surtout dans ces circonstances c tait l g rement humide et donc d licat pour se passer le relais maintenant nous de ne pas nous mettre la pression et de bien nous reposer si nos deux petites fautes ne se r p tent pas en finale alors nous pouvons esp rer
6458842 nous sommes vraiment soulag es parce que c tait seulement la deuxi me fois que nous courrions ensemble cette saison et les etats unis nous ont encore une fois d montr que tout peut arriver on a aussi pu voir que les entra nements ax e sur le relais et la coordination ont pay nous abordons maintenant la finale avec le m me sentiment quavant celle dosaka nous sommes peut tre la seule quipe qui ne se prend pas vraiment au s rieux

6458850 i am trying really hard to speak clearly about how what i did reflects jesus love and justice and so i hope the permanent judicial council acquits me
6458851 we were told that most likely our child would never walk talk ride a bike or go to school and we should maybe consider institutionalization
6458852 for a long time ive been wanting to meet as many people as i can
6458853 maybe it will help a family five years from now
6458854 coming from hearing that your child wouldnt do those things to watching his first steps and hearing his first words its amazing
6458855 you just live your life and think nothing is going to happen to you we dont take that kind of stuff for granted anymore
6458856 our family is going to continue to do as much as we can for him
6458857 for me i dont want to look 15 years down the road when he should be on his own going to college i want to see what i can do for him now
6458858 i just couldnt believe someone would steal money from a farmer who puts that much effort and hard work into a farm
6458859 were sorry it happened but we would forgive him the thief or thieves the biblical way is to forgive your enemies so we have no grudge against him
6458860 weve certainly learned from our mistake there is no access to any cash on our spot anymore its a lesson everyone should learn
6458861 the biggest thing i would suggest is not to use the boxes at all instead use a change apron
6458862 i dont think this will be an ongoing problem in the market but we just have to be aware of the fact that this is happening and let the public know as well there is a lot of attention on it so hopefully this person or persons wont be coming back
6458863 the basic fact that you have a distinction between low property wealth districts and high property wealth districts ultimately that leads down the road to gaps in education performance
6458864 its about using your information to make better business decisions
6458865 slap a bow on or wrap it and your wedding shopping is done
6458866 we certainly had more moisture than required but we should have had sun too it would have improved the crop a bit
6458867 we got into it 20 years ago stephen and i and kept expanding since then
6458868 theres a lot of work to them but nothing comes easy
6458869 two acres of hay will heat a home for the winter four per cent of the land in canada can produce enough hay to heat every home in canada
6458870 hay contains sand and potassium chloride and its ashes are heavy
6458871 when its burning the sand turns to glass thats an inch thick it builds up like a lump of lava rock it builds up in the pot and puts the fire out i had to find a way to break the glass back into sand
6458872 when i first put the hay pellets in the furnace within five minutes it was burning at 500 within seven minutes it reached 1000 i turned it down set it to boil hot water 212 f and four hours later i looked and there were no ashes
6458873 i want to see the farmers be able get their hay land back into production instead of growing bushes
6458874 one ton of hay pellets is equivalent to 700 worth of oil
6458875 short green grasses are not good for fuel but if the farmer lets his hay field go until the end of august it will dry perfectly if it gets rained on it doesnt matter once its dried out it can be made into pellets
6458876 every 50 acres of reed canary grass burnt as hay pellets in a hay pellet furnace prevents the emission of 1800 tonnes of co2
6458877 todays farm operations require a high level of skills and knowledge in areas such as food safety farm safety and the use of technologies
6458878 the training of people to work in the industry will help it become more competitive and sustainable
6458879 volunteers are quite susceptible to blight because there is nobody spraying them
6458880 my response was and is sure there are a lot of difficulties and challenges involved but its time to put seat belts on motor coaches
6458881 no one has been saying one size fits all in terms of seat belts and safety
6458882 but the recommendation has been that motor coach safety has been an orphan at the department of transportation and it hasnt been addressed and now we are seeing enough deaths on the highways in which its getting their attention the sad part is there would have been a lot of lives saved in a timely fashion if they moved forward on it 40 years ago
6458883 its premature to even speculate about that until we have scientific data
6458884 remember you have to do this right the first time were talking about human lives
6458885 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature

6458908 the single biggest change youll see is the way linux evolves to meet the growing market of users who are not themselves linux savvy but are looking for a low cost alternative to microsoft or even the mac that alone will stimulate enormous changes across the board but there are many other things coming down the pike in the next four years all well worth looking forward to
6458909 by 2012 itll be a brand name unto itself thanks to the exploding netbook market where linux has proven itself to be a solid way to build an inexpensive computing platform by that time many first tier manufacturers like dell ought to be offering such devices and those that already do like hp will probably be looking seriously at offering more linux based gear

6458920 any comments negative or positive about anothers share experience life program or remarks are crosstalk that is interference
6458921 a member may talk about his or her own experience as it relates directly or indirectly to anothers share but should not refer to that persons share even comments such as when you talk about it reminded me of my own experience are possibly inappropriate

6458923 in sharing during meetings we proceed in an orderly respectful manner
6458924 to please not interrupt someone elses sharing not to make comments about other peoples statements and to talk only about yourself
6458925 from the very beginning one drunk talking to another has made the a a program go round but in meetings of the other fellowship i feel it makes sense to refrain from crosstalk people are trying to free themselves from extraordinary shame when someone shares in response to something ive said thats okay but only so long as theres not even a hint of censure belittlement scolding or preaching all under the guise of sharing knowing theres no risk of judgment makes me feel safe
6458926 comparing notes many of us realized that nonjudgmental suggestions we had received in meetings in response to something we had shared was very beneficial to our recovery it is how we learn and thats what sharing experience strength and hope is all about also there is a thin line between guidelines and rules and experience suggests that in a a s benign anarchy rules rigidity and attempts to control dont work very well

6459000 we also had about 25 people trained in the sharing jesus without fear study
6459001 their whole purpose at the bash was to go out and start conversations and interact with the people who come we came out earlier and prayed over the field and our desire for the spirit to move in this place we have been intentional in that way
6459002 events like these help us grow closer as a church and help us to come together while we are also helping others

6459037 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6459038 being with these young people is so refreshing because you can see in them that they are truly excited about christianity and are really striving to live humble and broken lives in the lord
6459039 they made a group on facebook where they have been able to talk and stay in touch since last year
6459040 because of that the students have made lasting friendships that didnt end when the tour was over and everybody seemed excited about going on the tour again
6459041 to be perfectly honest there is not one dud in the group
6459042 from what ive seen every one of the choir members have great voices that they consciously use every night to honor god
6459043 in our devotional time we talk about worship and how its done in the bible
6459044 we have also heard a lot about our attitudes for worship and how it directly influences our personal worship as well as others worship especially if were leading them
6459045 memorization is important because if you mumble a lot up there or youre not confident in what youre singing the audience is going to pick up on it and it wont be as effective
6459046 yes we ask them to memorize the material so they can better engage their audience
6459047 they need to have that eye contact to make it a real spiritual experience actually an almost physical one its necessary to take down those walls and let worship really take place
6459048 we want to come away knowing that both our audience and our performers received a real taste of worship
6459049 its so great to get to know and become close with the other choir members the adult leaders and even with our nightly host home families
6459050 but at the same time its really hard to say good bye when its over you get so close in that weeks time i know ill just be bawling
6459051 after my release i do not intend to return to the oil industry
6459052 i intend to engage in humanitarian activities and dedicate myself to my family
6459053 there is a great deal of resistance to freeing khodorkovsky
6459054 i dont think that its on the cards this time
6459055 the church is not a business not an experiment not a product to be sold it is an outpost of the kingdom a sign of things to come in christs sovereign rule which is now hidden but will be made open and public then all the world will bow before him in recognition of who he is
6459056 all the categories of biblical theology must be kept in mind simultaneously to inform the christian worldview
6459057 but because of the absolute blackout on information there we have been unable to do that
6459058 reliable witnesses say that 400 people have been killed in the region of the tibetan capital
6459059 killed by bullets even though they were protesting without weapons their bodies were never given back to their families if you consider the whole of tibet the number of victims is obviously higher
6459060 ten thousand people have been arrested we dont know where they are imprisoned
6459061 makes me think that this colonisation by the army is destined to last
6459062 a project of long term brutal repression is under way
6459063 but we were quickly disillusioned our envoys came up against a wall there was no opening
6459064 real autonomy because we know what chinese style autonomy is a trap
6459065 everyone recognizes that for children to be children they need time to play
6459066 play at any stage of a childs development helps instill a sense of accomplishment delight and both intellectual and social growth what is equally important to understand is the opportunities that play provides parents to engage with their children to praise and encourage them in ways that instill strong and enduring bonds we at hearthsong have always believed that play is a critical component of a childs learning and development
6459067 laughter and engagement in active play is essential to the well being of your child
6459068 every aspect of ordering parts to keep our equipment in working order is mission critical and that includes the edi system we use to automate the transaction flow
6459069 we selected seeburger as our first in house edi provider because they offer a proven platform small supplier connectivity solutions that will virtually eliminate the need for paper based transaction processing and the shortest learning curve and strongest customer references of any vendor we evaluated
6459070 the e studio2330c is a perfect color solution for lean and fast companies or remote offices that want to use color to differentiate themselves from their competitors in todays aggressive business landscape
6459071 the e studio2330c provides this market with fast color speeds image quality and compatibility all in a competitive cost per page package that is in line with todays small and mid sized businesses sensibilities
6459072 an unidentified man asked for barack obamas and mark warners stands on the employee free choice act
6459073 they have to cooperate with management so they all grow
6459074 its important to take god seriously and not take yourself too seriously
6459075 most people dont include the lord in their life all the world was in business before i showed up and will still be functioning long after im gone
6459076 i think it makes it easier i dont have to wake up every morning and wonder what im going to believe today it releases you from tension and struggle
6459077 the most important issue facing america is how we treat each other and our respect for the sanctity of life
6459078 it took women 150 years to get the right to vote it took people of color 200 years to come to a place of acceptance
6459079 i am convinced with all my heart that god almighty gave us this land and capacity to survive because we had elevated human life what a magnificent elevation and celebration of the human spirit
6459080 we believe in no soldier left behind we risk able bodied men and thousands of dollars of equipment to rescue a wounded soldier his value is not in his function but in his person
6459081 its not causing people to be angry its causing people to think it is this type of approach that is reducing the number of abortions in cities where vitae is advertising
6459082 it is saving human life it is elevating human life
6459083 if you believe that your own life has value how can you devalue another person
6459084 i wont rule out making another race sometime right now im focusing on helping senator john mccain get elected
6459085 i dont think senator lieberman would be a good choice republicans want a republican i dont know that he would be a good fit to be vice president
6459086 its got to be somebody hes comfortable with somebody to help him get his message out hes pro life he does support traditional marriage and the sanctity of human life his opponent does not
6459087 how wonderful people are i came away encouraged by what i saw in people
6459088 running for president wasnt nearly as brutal or savage as anything i ran for in arkansas
6459089 the person being disciplined almost immediately in the process admitted that he had failed to live by the teachings of the covenant that he had signed
6459090 he knew that he had violated the promise the commitment that he had made to the body sadly he was put out of the body we still pray for him
6459091 the real issue is not having a covenant but the real issue is using a covenant
6459092 and you will use a covenant either more or less depending on your seriousness about regenerate church membership
6459093 the idea of a covenant is very much a part of what were talking about
6459094 churches if they want to be healthy there has to be a standard there has to be a sense of this is who we are an identification if you want to identify as a part of the body of christ then there are some expectations
6459095 i find people everywhere who are discouraged about business as usual and actually the seeker sensitive stuff has become business as usual
6459096 its not producing a really healthy church in many cases its not healthy because its mainly filled with non believers so i think the first issue of health is to deal with who are the believers and try to have a regenerate church membership
6459097 weve got to be able to walk that tightrope and allow the holy spirit to lead us in this
6459098 weve got to have standards weve got to have expectations
6459099 wise pastors in those countries are unhappy with western methods that are coming over
6459100 were transporting all this methodology that weve had thats really produced a very unhealthy church
6459101 church is the one place where we expect the least out of people and you get what you expect a lot of times
6459102 thats why we are dealing with over half of our folks not even showing up on sunday morning and thats a base measurement of whether they are committed or not
6459103 according to the needs of the hour according to the conflicts we face
6459104 it fits with james when he talks about if youre a christian your life should measure up in certain ways
6459105 its hard to measure love and yet paul puts love at the top of the list every time in each of the new testament books
6459106 he keeps coming back to this issue of love being the supreme thing so really in gods mind what is a great church a great church is a church that loves
6459107 this morning july 22 i was with these men and they were all saying ive never been in a church like this where people loved each other like this where you have such a unity in the body thats not measurable on a piece of paper but it certainly is known by the people who are experiencing it
6459108 theres something very valuable about the process of coming up with a church covenant that drives it home to the people
6459109 i would suggest that pastors and some key people come together intentionally to study the whole issue of what needs to be put in a church covenant by reviewing many church covenants and weighing what they believe is best
6459110 it brings together then the true members at least purifies the church considerably
6459111 quit being pragmatic and look at what god requires the church to be
6459112 god might call a church healthy but some church growth specialist might not
6459113 were really doing a very big disservice to people who are not believers to keep them on our rolls its not loving and its almost aiding and abetting their sin
6459114 weve focused more on the external than helping people truly become transformed
6459115 and behold some men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed and they were seeking to bring him in and lay him before jesus but finding no way to bring him in because of the crowd they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before jesus
6459116 who is this who speaks blasphemies who can forgive sins but god alone
6459117 why do you question in your hearts which is easier to say your sins are forgiven you or to say rise and walk but that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins
6459118 the open court rule which is extremely historically important has now become distorted by the effect of massive search engines so that documents containing all sorts of personal information find themselves searchable worldwide

6459136 and despite the negative news about the economy the midmarket is a great growth opportunity for value added resellers

6459209 es pedirle a la c mara lo que no hace el poder judicial o los otros poderes del estado que definen asignaciones que las fijan en forma arbitraria nadie los cuestiona por ese tipo de cosas
6459210 absolutamente injusto y arbitrario para los diputados que tenemos un n mero importante de comunas que representar
6459211 hay parlamentarios que son de santiago y no gastan ese dinero hay otros que son de la quinta regi n que han aparecido paradojalmente hablando de este tema y que no deben gastar ni un tercio de ese dinero
6459212 una situaci n que sea equivalente a las zonas que representamos y no como hoy d a en donde todos tienen la misma asignaci n cuando en definitiva no gastan toda la plata en bencinas quiero que se haga justicia en este tema

6459231 the competition is still out there that im not ready to declare a starter nick has had better days than steve and steve has had better days than nick at the end of spring steve may have been a little ahead nick has closed that gap if not more but its all speculation weve got another four or five practices before ill declare for sure and even if then

6459234 we think he has a chance for the starting job

6459250 if patients dont respond well to carbamazepine or one or two other drugs it is reasonable to consider surgery that targets the root of the trigeminal nerve
6459251 the evidence of efficacy of medications other than carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine is about as strong as the evidence of efficacy of surgical procedures targeting the gasserian ganglion or microvascular decompression

6459253 based upon cost local expertise and availability and patient preferences obtaining trigeminal reflex testing or head imaging are both reasonable next steps
6459254 some experts believe patients with trigeminal neuralgia failing to respond to first line therapy are unlikely to respond to alternative medications and suggest early surgical referral
6459255 practice parameter the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia an evidence based review

6459417 after nearly a year of investigating sheriff pat hedges on eavesdropping allegations state investigators said wednesday they would not press criminal charges because of insufficient evidence
6459418 after consideration of all the information it doesnt appear that there is sufficient evidence to sustain any criminal charges beyond a reasonable doubt
6459419 our office will not be taking any further action in this matter
6459420 the undersheriff and i are pleased but far from surprised by this outcome
6459421 there was never any real dispute as to what had occurred nor that we were investigating allegedly criminal conduct which under the law allows us to record that meeting
6459422 this is obviously the conclusion reached by the attorney general
6459423 the decision of the attorney general does not exonerate the actions of the sheriff it merely identifies that they may not be able to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt
6459424 the attorney generals decision is irrelevant to the merits of hovings claims
6459425 the attorney general examined only elements of state law hovings federal claims center on constitutional law

6459469 we have pointed out to the international community from the very start that the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo could present a dangerous precedent

6459507 choosing to shoot the film in new york was a risky decision as the drama industry works very differently in the us from the uk
6459508 but the huge amount of strategic planning and the leap of faith are delivering a first rate calibre of cast there is a real buzz about the project in manhattan as quentin was a much loved and notorious figure everyone has an anecdote to tell about him
6459509 and weve been touched by the number of friends and admirers of his some of whom he never knew who have wanted to help with the project in myriad different ways
6459510 we are delighted to be making another film about quentin crisp given the naked civil servant was such a landmark film for itv
6459511 its a real thrill and honour to be bringing an actor of john hurts stature back to the channel to reprise such an iconic role
6459512 this is largely down to the quality of brian fillis wonderful script which completely captures the extraordinary and outrageous character of quentin crisp
6459513 weve checked with a variety of music executives at major labels and none of them have heard about it not happening
6459514 it is encouraging to know so many people are looking for stuart and offering us their support

6459528 zo ging het de vorige keer ook nu heeft de commissie duidelijk gekozen om bepaalde organisaties hun plan uit te laten voeren in plaats van half half
6459529 het is voor ons heel moeilijk om publiek te bereiken
6459530 we kunnen bovendien nu de muzikanten eindelijk een beetje fatsoenlijk betalen een aantal mensen in de band had er een baantje naast dat kan op zich best maar in de praktijk zorgt het ervoor dat we soms gewoon niet beschikbaar zijn voor een boeking
6459531 we zijn wel even euforisch maar je durft haast niet te juichen omdat je weet dat andere mensen juist niets krijgen
6459532 we hebben nu drie van die optredens gepland staan maar het is een erg dure productie nu willen we zeker meer van die avonden organiseren

6459535 while the facts are still in dispute the detailed reports that cluster bombs have been used in the conflict in georgia are deeply disturbing
6459536 ireland totally condemns the use of these appalling and indiscriminate weapons in all circumstances which is why we have taken a lead in efforts to promote a worldwide ban through the cluster munitions convention agreed in dublin in may

6459554 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6459555 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6459556 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6459557 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6459558 he was a tough negotiator but always reasonable and respectful with the ultimate goal of growing the game
6459559 charlotte and sam do this party every year with publicist amanda silverman

6459565 wont produce their first kilowatts of electricity for many years
6459566 from my perspective obama needs to introduce a game changer and fast before public opinion starts to gel around the notion that he is a phenom who deserves great respect but is not seasoned enough and would be too much of a risk in the oval office
6459567 the mccain campaign believes that some of hillary clintons tactics especially questioning whether obama is ready to lead can be a real winner
6459568 the mccain team has been very open that they went to school on the hillary clinton campaign that they learned from that
6459569 and on this 3 a m ad whats very striking as some have pointed out over the last few days is that barack obama was winning a steady streak of victories against hillary clinton
6459570 and then she ran that ad and she really went on the attack on the experience question and she won the bulk of the primaries thereafter in the closing months of the democratic primaries and won 500 000 more votes than he did and almost took it away from him
6459571 which candidate do voters believe is better qualified to deal with russia mccain by better than 2 to 1
6459572 going after more centrist voters more swing voters more conservative voters who will be a much bigger deal in the general election than they were in those primaries and caucuses
6459573 what the clinton campaign demonstrated is when you bring obama back down to earth its a better battle
6459574 along comes mccain who not only has he doesnt like to talk about his religion very much and then he talks about it openly but he has a very powerful story thats emotionally connected to the audience
6459575 its the candidate who can connect emotionally to middle america who will have the big advantage going down the stretch
6459576 the big question now is whether obama can successfully regain control of the campaign agenda as we head into the democratic convention

6459593 knowing that that theres radio play now and that a larger audience is hearing it means that i feel responsible for what i put out there

6459606 all the information we have suggests its not going to be a serious problem at all the most recent numbers suggest less and less and less protestors there are some folks out there that want to cause a disturbance therell be a few of them well take care of it i dont see it as being a significant problem we have planned for any eventuality no matter what happens i think we have contingencies plans in place but we dont expect it to serious at all

6459610 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6459611 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6459612 i guess if youre making 3 million a year youre middle class
6459613 its not the job of the government to define who is rich
6459614 raise taxes on your income your electric bills even your life savings
6459615 the real fault lines are over how to treat people in the highest tax brackets it gets to the heart of their economic philosophies
6459616 both tax plans take for granted a big peace dividend from ending the war in iraq
6459617 been law for eight years now and taxpayers are used to those rates
6459618 allowing them to expire would be tantamount to a massive tax increase

6459627 while many americans are living paycheck to paycheck to effectively protect ourselves for the future we need to start saving paycheck to paycheck
6459628 our study shows that americans are better at saving money when they are thinking about it month to month on an ongoing basis rather than a long term goal
6459629 we plan on pay raises work bonuses and other monies to come forward but we cannot be thinking this way we need to start saving money every day
6459630 planning too far in advance not only makes consumers over optimistic regarding how much they will save but it also makes them behave in more aggressive and risk seeking ways in other financial arenas
6459631 the easiest thing to do is to be a smarter consumer and make spending and saving decisions thoughtfully on a daily basis that extra cup of coffee every morning carpooling with a co worker and cutting out the extras
6459632 the harder and more prudent thing to do is to mindfully take a portion of your earnings each pay period and save it in the bank
6459633 americans cant solely depend on their retirement plan it will be painful but like that mortgage or car loan payment we need to start thinking about a savings transfer every pay period
6459634 when a man receives hormone therapy initially the treatment works well and his psa prostate specific antigen level goes down
6459635 but inevitably the psa will start climbing again and that is usually the first sign that the treatment is beginning to fail its a sign that the cancer in the prostate is making a comeback
6459636 the androgen receptor acts differently in different cells in prostate tissue
6459637 its always been assumed that blocking the androgen receptor will stop all prostate cells from growing but we have found that thats not the case since current treatment acts non specifically on all the cells having androgen receptors in the prostate blocking the androgen receptor will give mixed results
6459638 while the androgen receptor is really driving prostate cancer in another sense it appears that the receptor also normally inhibits the spread of cancer cells it seems to have a dual role manipulating the androgen receptor can increase or decrease either of these actions depending on precisely how its done
6459639 the effects of the androgen receptor on hair growth in men vary dramatically depending on where in the body the receptor is working
6459640 when the receptor is very active in the mustache area more hair grows when its very active on the top of the skull toward the front hair falls out and men become bald and the hair on the back of the head is insensitive to the receptor the effects of hormones depend on the location
6459641 we found that the same is true within the cells of the prostate itself
6459642 at the bottom of the sea we find mountains which are about the same height as the alps
6459643 these are partially overlaid by sediments so that we have to look beneath the surface to find clues hinting at the geological history of the mendeleev ridge
6459644 up to july 2008 this year has been cooler than the previous five years at least it still looks like its warmer than average
6459645 as long as the commodity side of the business is not being detrimental to our results were satisfied with that
6459646 that was obviously not the picture in this quarter and it wont be next quarter either
6459647 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6459648 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county

6459657 mccains choice of pawlenty appears to lift his support by 13 points 25 of undecided voters and initial obama supporters report that pawlentys presence on the ticket would pull them over this could be enough to move minnesota into the republican column for the first time since 1972
6459658 i had to think of how i would reassure big that nothing happened with pac i hadnt been completely innocent while i was in los angeles id had sex occasionally with and id even seen roger the nba player a few times when he was in town so technically i had cheated on big but not with tupac

6459670 weve stepped up to a whole new level since the world championships but what is more surprising to me is not so much that we have done that because there are reasons for that our preparation our training and our planning but that some nations have underperformed and the gap has been exaggerated

6459739 these type of sexualised messages should not be allowed in the public domain

6459816 if australia were to follow the racps recommendation to include adhd as a disability category eligible for additional support funding special education budgets for all australian educational jurisdictions would skyrocket
6459817 schools and educational systems will not be able to cope with the demand and as such each additional supported child will receive less

6459846 ja rintje is in nrc handelsblad altijd 4 tot 5 jaar oud gebleven maar is nu toch wel op leeftijd hoor als pup was hij een adhd hondje maar het voordeel van ouder worden is ook bij foxen dat ze een karakter ontwikkelen en dat ze net als veel mensen geleidelijk aan rustiger worden
6459847 tijdens mijn studie aan de rietveldacademie ben ik begonnen met een jaar theatervormgeving en vroeger ging ik met mijn oma vaak naar de schouwburg dus ja het zat er wel in mensen vagen me vaak of het ontwerpen van een decor mij niet een heel gekke opdracht voor mij is iemand die gewend is op een klein vlak te werken en nu ineens een grote ruimte tot zijn beschikking heeft maar ik ervaar dat niet op die manier voor een boek een verhaal of een illustratie bedenk je een steeds een eigen universum en voor het decorontwerp van coppelia is dat ook zo
6459848 het is er een van verleiding het decor wordt gemaakt in samenwerking met de decorafdeling van het muziektheater een fantastische ploeg met een enorme rekwisietenafdeling daardoor word je enorm verleid om gebruik te maken van special effects maar ik heb me desondanks weten te beperken tot wat de directe kracht is van mijn tekeningen ik wilde een decor dat er uitziet als een sprookjesboek als tekeningen waar dansers in dansen het is een driedimensionaal decor maar in zekere zin toch ook plat het lijkt net een papieren decor zodat kinderen en volwassenen denken dat je een sprookjesboek binnenstapt
6459849 het is gebaseerd op hoffmans vertellingen het gaat om een mad wizard genaamd dokter coppelius die bedenkt een ideale vrouw janine brogt de dramaturge van coppelia heeft het verhaal lichtjes verplaatst naar nu naar de total make overs zoals je die nu bijna dagelijks ook op tv kunt zien dus komen we nu in het lab terecht van die griezelige dokter in alle oude coppelia producties zie je dan een oud mannetje met een knijpriddertje in deze versie is dr coppelius een heel verleidelijk mannetje een dr robert schumacher achtig type het verhaal draait eigenlijk om zwaantje en frans die gaan trouwen maar frans wordt verleid door de creatie van dr coppelius en zwaantje besluit hem te redden
6459850 die kast in de aangename ruimte van de kliniek van dr coppelius is eigenlijk een poppenhuis met achter elk deurtje een creatie van dr coppelius dat er is opgeborgen die creaties zijn moderne archetypen van droomfiguren zoals james bond catwoman en een prinses stereotypen op wie jij en ik eventueel zouden willen lijken
6459851 ik was helemaal vrij maar natuurlijk wel gebonden aan het aantal aktes dat er is en de handelingen die er moeten plaatsvinden voor het overige ben ik totaal vrij gelaten het is een feest om zo vrij te kunnen zijn in de derde akte zijn we bijvoorbeeld op een groot feest de grote bomen die er staan zijn overdag zwart wit zijn maar s avonds veranderen ze in lampions
6459852 ik wilde graag een grafisch decor waar je de tekening er nog aan af kunt zien mijn grote voorbeeld is david hockney de ontwerper van the rakes progress hij baseerde zich voor die ontwerpen op gravures ik wil ook graag een tekenachtigheid in de decors
6459853 ik ben aanvankelijk alleen voor de decors gevraagd maar in mijn boeken trek ik een hele wereld op dat wilde ik op het podium eigenlijk ook doen ik wilde kunnen bepalen hoe de hoofdpersoon er uit zou zien vandaar dat ik er concepten voor heb bedacht ik wilde heel duidelijk de tekenlijn terug laten komen in de kostuums de stoffen worden daarom met de hand beschilderd zodat je er een handmatigheid in houdt
6459854 er wordt op dit moment hard aan gewerkt over acht maanden moet coppelia in premi re gaan als je opeens een proefopstelling ziet op een immens podium dat is heel wat anders dan een tekening in mijn studio voor mij is het wel wennen ook dat ik me overal tegenaan moet bemoeien
