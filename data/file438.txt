4380012 the pattern has changed this time macroeconomic weakness has complicated the problem
4380013 because of the macro environment we are conservative about future investment
4380014 i said i imagine yall are here to watch drew right
4380015 they kind of laughed and felt bad that they werent there to watch me i relayed to them that one of my career goals was to get where im good enough where someone might actually go to a golf course pick up a pairing sheet and say ill follow bob heintzs group today
4380016 thats kind of a vague career goal but they started to tease me about that as the day went on i guess ill follow you now id rather have attention than you know have nobody know who i was
4380017 if i was to point to something and say this could be stressful for me right now it would not be whether i get into the fedex cup
4380018 it would be you know am i going to be able to finish this year in the top 125
4380019 am i going to be able to finish in the top 150
4380020 this golf course actually sets up better for me than forest oaks did
4380021 this is more of a placement off the tee kind of golf course and hitting the greens and making some putts forest oaks was more of a shootout see how many birdies you can make if you hit it long you had an advantage
4380022 over here you dont youve got to place it around the golf course which is kind of more suited to my game

4380025 theres been no problem in the camp which we know of anyway
4380026 theres nothing like that happening within the club the players have responded to all weve given them
4380027 in our household we actually put the scraps in the refrigerator until the night before
4380028 we put things like chicken scraps as an example in the freezer
4380029 then we put it out in the bin and its going to be less fragrant and therefore less attractive for the scavengers
4380030 just think about what youre putting out because theyre scavengers and theyre going to come looking for easy food sources
4380031 animals just see that as an invitation to dinner and do not put out that invitation unless you want them to come
4380032 how do you simulate something when the conditions are entirely different
4380033 understand the dynamics of what would cause the accident the way it did
4380034 we didnt think that was as important because when the accident happened both vessels had entered a pool of open water
4380035 we are convinced that there were lookouts on the quarterdeck of the sir william alexander at the time of accident
4380036 i think quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4380037 mr dion says he doesnt support the government but wont say whether he will defeat us or not i dont think thats a tenable situation
4380038 this is the prime minister who made a virtue of passing fixed election date legislation and now hes threatening to cross sussex drive and go see his neighbour the governor general and ask for an election because hes fabricating a crisis where none exists
4380039 a major part of whatever is dysfunctional is coming from the government side
4380040 he is choosing to cover over that which is another reason why people dont trust mr harper
4380041 we are going to make sure that atlantic canadians are not tricked into voting for a carbon tax that would damage the region
4380042 it would hurt families here it would hurt industries here
4380043 this is tragic not only for us the family but for people in general
4380044 right now a lot of us are still post traumatized by this
4380045 what can you say theres nothing we can say theres nothing we can do other than believe the systems going to run its course
4380046 i think that the accused have to know that there are people here who care again representing jennifer
4380047 jennifer was a very loved person we still love her we love the memories of her and its going to grow and grow
4380048 she was just a wonderful warm kind loving individual and again i cant say enough about her character and her innocence
4380049 we cant bring jennifer back but this is one way that we can honour her memory
4380050 actually i am in the process of doing that right now your honour
4380051 i do have somebody looking into it right now they havent given me a yes or a no
4380052 after the revelations last month about the depth of my own convict ancestry perhaps i should feel at home here
4380053 i am almost a thoroughbred when it comes to my convict past
4380054 one of my forebears from seven generations back was transported to sydney in 1789 then sent on to norfolk island at the time the only convict settlements in the british empire more remote than port arthur
4380055 this is the most significant convict heritage site in our nation
4380056 in bricks and mortar this stark landscape confronts us with the dramatic story of our nations beginnings a story so familiar that we easily lose sight of just how remarkable and improbable it is
4380057 the story of a faraway land populated by the cast offs of an empire men and women who remain in the blood lines of so many of us today
4380058 the scale of convict transportation to australia was far greater than any other penal colony in the world whether we measure it in terms of the numbers sent the duration of the journey or the vastness of the areas settled
4380059 five died on the spot while the wounded were rushed to montevista district hospital and davao regional hospital
4380060 the marketing people for these companies are smart and they go after the top athletes the gold medalists
4380061 so someone who is finishing lower in the rankings if they see the gold medalist wearing this new suit they are going to want to try it out as well
4380062 they looked at fish and sharks and tried to recreate a surface that is similar to what they would have on their skin
4380063 its similar to the non stick frying pans you use to cook your eggs if you have a smooth surface then instead of water sticking to the suit which would cause friction it slides along it with less friction the athlete then is able to move faster
4380064 the team is here to monitor changes in ground deformation which is a key parameter in explaining the volcanos ongoing abnormal behavior
4380065 they should look deeper into it we suspect these are the handiwork of a third party whose aim is to worsen the situation
4380066 this isnt over yet we expect more harassment and bombing
4380067 in the heat of the moment everybody can get carried away but its important that we respect referees and opponents and its important for us as professionals to give a good example
4380068 its up to us as a group of players to move forward and make sure we are responsible for our actions on the pitch
4380069 i hold my hands up and say that at times i have over stepped the mark but we are here to move forward this is a step in the right direction
4380070 i think the idea is terrific its designed to cut out excesses and thats what we are trying to do
4380071 everybody is signed up to make it work and it will be great if it does
4380072 america is like a healthy body and its resistance is threefold its patriotism its morality and its spiritual life if we can undermine these three areas america will collapse from within
4380073 the us is in very real danger from a politically ignorant uninformed electorate
4380074 when an audience does not complain it is a compliment amp when they do it is a compliment too if unaccompanied by violence
4380075 the men american people admire most extravagantly are the most daring liars

4380077 a liberal is someone who feels a great debt to his fellow man which
4380078 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
4380079 no free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms the strongest reason for people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is as a last resort to protect themselves against tyranny in government
4380080 i personally think hes the best coach in the history of the league and wed be lucky if we can get him here that said hes not the coach of the galaxy cobi is thats the way it is as of today
4380081 theres information encoded in the molecules that results in getting certain size and spacing of features with certain desirable properties
4380082 thermodynamic driving forces make the structures more uniform in size and higher density than you can obtain with the traditional materials
4380083 if you only have to pattern every fourth spot you can write those patterns at a fraction of the time and expense
4380084 i would see this as very on line with what forster recommended
4380085 he recommended a flatter structure greater performance greater accountability increased transparency and ensuring that the majority of our 8 5 billion budget is directed at clinical services
4380086 this will allow larger and better resourced districts to deliver local health services and important hospital building programs
4380087 more than anything people are saying to me there is confusion and some lack of clarity which can be rectified and there needs to be a decision as to where the accountabilities lie
4380088 waiting lists have continued to grow and not enough new beds have been delivered despite numerous promises rhetoric and now more restructuring
4380089 sayesha try not to faint this year youre holding the flag and leading the procession

4380095 the u s government has spent some 7 billion building a repository for nuclear waste at yucca mountain in nevada
4380096 coal is making us sick oil is making us sick
4380097 on june 3 the department of energy submitted an 8 600 page application to the nuclear regulatory commission seeking approval of the yucca mountain site for waste storage just one day later nevada urged the agency to reject the application
4380098 no u s plant worker or member of the public has ever been injured or killed by an accident caused by nuclear power

4380130 while im not going to comment about those specific allegations its my view that anyone who is illegally involved in diverting water in the murray darling system during this crisis is engaging in an act of terrorism against the people of australia
4380131 it is a criminal offence and anyone siphoning water off illegally in my view should be locked up rather than the fines that i am told are currently in place
4380132 anyone who is doing this sort of thing is unbelievably treacherous to the national interest and its an act of terrorism against the australian people
4380133 i dont think people are too keen to take positions into the weekend mr herring said
4380134 wall street provided a good lead but weve seen spot gold come off oil was a bit weaker overnight and there was a fairly sharp rally in commodity stocks yesterday
4380135 equity traders remain sceptical as overbought commodity prices tumbled through the week on slowing global growth and stronger us dollar he said
4380136 gt day eight of olympic sale get a great deal on
4380137 with our groovy applications apples iphone can literally be transformed into a mini computer that doubles as a phone
4380138 our iphone apps bundle covers a huge spectrum of the most popular activities carried out by the general public on their home computer making this the greatest collection of iphone applications ever
4380139 we are the first and only company of our kind offering this exclusive package
4380140 and with a price tag of only 24 95 its a steal
4380141 for the first time in my life i was amazed by the mastery with which putin is able to hold onto power
4380142 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located we wont allow the deaths of our compatriots go unpunished
4380143 in any case i think this too is an indirect indication of who is more important in this ruling tandem
4380144 you see thugs differ from normal people in that when they smell blood its hard for them to stop
4380145 otherwise people would begin to call into question his ability to run the country and accuse him of being spineless
4380146 the political process can always be looked at either through a telescope or a microscope
4380147 if you look up close of course much is changing but if you take the longer view it turns out that the system was totalitarian and continues to be totalitarian
4380148 there were enormous complexities and there are some loose ends that we have not nailed down we have figured out most of the solutions however
4380149 weve made enough progress on our system issues to begin shipping from some of our distribution centers today and will continue to work though the night to have shipments available to run all distribution centers tomorrow
4380150 i probably wouldnt have noticed if they hadnt informed me
4380151 this time the sites been up but our shipping system is down its worse than it was in march were really backlogged
4380152 there is no divide to the air that we all breathe or the clean water that we all depend on
4380153 there is no divide between our common desire to make the border region an economic powerhouse
4380154 we know that when storms or other natural disasters occur they do not respect political boundaries
4380155 itll depend on where she is now how important the case is how much it would cost the taxpayers and whether witnesses are still around
4380156 she was a rather bizarre character and seems to have a strange circumstance now
4380157 there was a strong aroma about her and i told her this needed to be taken care of before i went to court with her
4380158 she must know shes a fugitive in at least one state
4380159 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4380160 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4380161 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4380162 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4380163 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4380164 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4380165 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4380166 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control
4380167 there is nothing in here about the inviolability of georgias frontiers
4380168 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4380169 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4380170 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4380171 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4380172 oxygen levels are something that we would monitor on a consistent basis
4380173 i know we dont have the situation that they have in the gulf of mexico
4380174 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4380175 its the kind of attack we have not seen much of in recent years
4380176 if theres one thing that always strikes me after a tragedy like this its the way the development community pulls itself together and really demonstrates its resolve to continue to work in this country
4380177 many people believe the insurgency is reacting to some extent to the progress in the country and the fact that they havent been able to stop the progress
4380178 the three parks being opened is based on the constitution of china that people are allowed to demonstrate if they have some issues
4380179 i think thats one step further for china to open up and i think its very good gesture
4380180 i think a few a very few people come here to pick to be critical and dig into the small details and find fault with that
4380181 that does not mean that were not fulfilling our promises
4380182 if anyone has applied it hasnt gone down to our level yet
4380183 we allow the refugees to stay in any unused building they can find
4380184 you can blame whomever you want but in the 21st century this is completely unacceptable
4380185 people who went north either went to their relatives or refugee camps
4380186 people who were left homeless and are still in south ossetia are living with their relatives or neighbours

4380197 we believe that he is the best man for ghana out of all the ministers we have had under this present government it is very clear that major courage quashigah has excelled in terms of honesty discipline and foresight he is liked by all ghanaians
4380198 it is time for ghanaians to eschew certain cultural and historical habits we elect people based on tribe and political affiliation ghana belongs to all of us it does not belong to any tribe political party or religion for that matter if we are to vote we have to look at the competence of the person his fairness and honesty we are advocating that he goes as an independent candidate
4380199 in ghana you and i agree that there is a lot of favoritism whom you know and all that this man has been able to stand out we have credible people who can run this country better but because of political parties and their memberships they have not been able to contribute meaningfully to the development of the country
4380200 we do not think it is an issue it is a matter of principle that if he indeed thinks what we are saying is true then he must listen to us as we all know he always listens to the masses

4380243 normally i belong to wanderers as well but they are not in operation yet this year
4380244 so bedford has been kind enough to let us go out there several times a week and use their facilities to throw on
4380245 but i never left dartmouth because its such a great club
4380246 it atmosphere was a little different because it is kind of a home game for us but is so close to pittsburgh that a lot of pittsburgh fans drove to the game
4380247 i think its going to do well for the nfl
4380248 we have to get the crowd a little bit more into it and it happens with time
4380249 when the regular season comes its going to be different because the first team will be out there for the whole game
4380250 but to be up here with the fans has been awesome
4380251 i dont care about this medal i wanted gold this will be my last match i wanted to take gold so i consider this olympics a failure
4380252 im extremely happy im overwhelmed at the response received here
4380253 you had jesse owens you had paavo nurmi carl lewis and now you have phelps and thats what we need to have
4380254 to have a piece of his gold medal with you and with every person on our team is just inspirational
4380255 i am considerate of the environment but im doing it more for my own pocketbook
4380256 north dakota is the largest state in terms of carbon sequestration and program participation
4380257 its hard enough to contain a species once it makes its way into nonnative waters
4380258 when each mud snail has the ability to produce large quantities of embryos without a partner youve really got a problem
4380259 where theyve gotten into streams in the western part of the country theyve caused a lot of problems
4380260 theyre taking over space that should have other native species living in it
4380261 i could sum it up in one word nothing the permit doesnt change a thing
4380262 weve got a lot of pride here i just wanted to make sure we didnt get lulled to sleep
4380263 you cant always have a good performance but you can come here and play hard
4380264 keep the game tight is what i wanted and the guys came through
4380265 i was able to hit the zone with all my pitches but the sinker was most effective for me
4380266 thats the edgar renteria ive known for a lot of years
4380267 i just didnt have the guys ready in the bullpen to do the job
4380268 i thought the frasor would be my best bet but he couldnt get the job done
4380269 we had opportunities to score but he just kept shutting us down
4380270 he runs a lot of balls down and he has a big forehand
4380271 if i play it his way it will be tough he is very quick around the court
4380272 i think i was a little more consistent on the big points
4380273 ive been playing here since i was 12 and a lot of the guys around have won
4380274 anderson has won jockel has won 2007 champion mathieu girouard has won so id like to be in there too with this being the 100th anniversary it would be extra special
4380275 evidence of its failure to do so is the fact that historic steps have been taken which are having a positive impact on reconciliation and prosperity in northern ireland
4380276 these developments will allow the region to look forward to the future with hope and this is reflected in the monument which is being dedicated at the 10th anniversary commemorative ceremony
4380277 embraced each other as family as friends as one suffering community
4380278 the people of omagh can take rightful pride in the remarkable contribution they made to the consolidation of an historic peace that is surely growing and deepening by the day
4380279 i probably hit 18 greens and i dont remember chipping so that was good too
4380280 it always feels good when you have no bogeys on your scorecard
4380281 i think my game has always been there its more emotionally sometimes you have ups and downs and distractions and youre tired
4380282 ive played solid the last couple of weeks ive had my rest and my time to practice and get motivated i dont want to get too far ahead this is just one round hopefully it will continue to go in this direction
4380283 i got off to a great start and made tons of putts
4380284 i missed a few opportunities on the second nine but i made a birdie to finish on a high note so im very pleased this course is tough and 5 under id take that any day here
4380285 id say the difference between the back nine and the front is the greens theyre not as undulating
4380286 but i want to say i had a career putting round
4380287 i cant remember the last time i had 10 putts on nine holes thats what you need to score here
4380288 youve got to be careful off the tee to hit the fairways thats going to be the key all week
4380289 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4380290 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4380291 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4380292 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4380293 i have deep ties to memorial basketball and have a strong ambition to see the mens team compete with the best teams in the country
4380294 i want to make the team into something that the community can support and be proud of
4380295 its been a long while since ive had a round with no bogeys
4380296 i had plenty of them last week thats for sure
4380297 its always nice to get one early in a tournament
4380298 now consumers can decide ill watch tennis or football let them choose
4380299 youve got to be careful off the tee to hit the fairways thats going to be the key all week
4380300 i got off to a great start and made tons of putts
4380301 i missed a few opportunities on the second nine but i made a birdie to finish on a high note so im very pleased this course is tough and 5 under id take that any day here
4380302 id say the difference between the back nine and the front is the greens theyre not as undulating
4380303 but i want to say i had a career putting round
4380304 i cant remember the last time i had 10 putts on nine holes thats what you need to score here
4380305 i dont think the trend of today rounds of 5 under or 4 under are going to continue the rest of the week
4380306 i dont think well see 11 under or 10 under on the very last day maybe 8 under or 7 under will win it
4380307 watching from afar with lebron he handles the ball a lot
4380308 i think that i can take a load off of him handling the ball at times hes a guy that kind of sets his teammates up a lot i think i can relieve him from that that will help him as far as being a little fresher at the end of the season
4380309 mos quickness with the basketball is something we havent had since i got here
4380310 we need to continue to get better we know that if that means some personnel changes need to happen then so be it
4380311 my actions are going to speak louder than my words
4380312 i know what it takes to win and its no secret it takes defence to win
4380313 it was hard to see them and keep an eye on them
4380314 all the hard work and stuff that ive done over the last 23 years is what allowed me to get here
4380315 this is really the show this is where we get to have a good time
4380316 the doctors basically said sit on the couch for the rest of your life
4380317 i probably spent a thousand nights thinking gee if i could only wrestle again what would i do differently
4380318 i dont think its very often in life that you get to really grieve over being done something and then think about what youd do differently forever and then get a chance to actually do it
4380319 what im doing now is the best thing i can think of doing im doing everything i wanted to do and didnt do
4380320 i had to hire a coach theres no canadian coach really the women and the freestyle men have dedicated coaches and a full time system
4380321 theyre all organized to get going ive been in the freestyle system long enough that i understand their organization and ive just done my own parallel organization
4380322 were not even halfway into the games right now and were a second half team weve always been a second half team
4380323 i would have loved the medal the first medal for canada would have been awesome to have
4380324 i couldnt pull it through but that doesnt mean we wont be having one soon
4380325 we have talked about this scenario many times before and it has not phased us in the slightest
4380326 we are ready to go same time same channel but friday
4380327 fourth place is probably the worst spot you can get at the olympic games
4380328 we still have 10 days to go at the olympics and there are going to be lots of medals coming from canadian athletes
4380329 i think it should be successful i did everything he asked me to do
4380330 as part of the reinstatement review he was given an opportunity to submit any relevant information he would like to provide he was asked to do that by this friday if he chose to do so
4380331 i didnt do them to influence the commissioner i did them to better myself as a person
4380332 they were normally things that i have been doing besides staying out of trouble thats what im trying to do
4380333 while im not going to comment about those specific allegations its my view that anyone who is illegally involved in diverting water in the murray darling system during this crisis is engaging in an act of terrorism against the people of australia
4380334 this essentially does breach that agreement because it does allow for water to be diverted out of the flood plain for irrigation
4380335 it is a criminal offence and anyone siphoning water off illegally in my view should be locked up rather than the fines that i am told are currently in place
4380336 anyone who is doing this sort of thing is unbelievably treacherous to the national interest and its an act of terrorism against the australian people

4380346 street fighter 4 you will see that the url streetfighter4

4380349 a possible motive for the killing is beginning to emerge concerning the lifestyle of xi zhou and zhen xing yang
4380350 community intelligence supported by the examination of computer equipment and mobile call data has shown that both of the victims have been involved in fraudulent activity which has angered and upset a number of people we are currently investigating this as a possible motive for the killings
4380351 given the recent nature of the cats death and where it was found it is reasonable to assume that those responsible for the two murders also killed the cat
4380352 adecco notes the announcement made this morning by and announces that it is still considering its position regarding a possible offer

4380365 despite the withdrawal of georgian armed forces and the unilateral declaration of a ceasefire russian military operations continued beyond south ossetia into territories under georgian government control
4380366 the continuation of these violent discriminatory acts constitutes an extremely urgent threat of irreparable harm to georgias rights under the cerd in dispute in this case
4380367 as a matter of utmost urgency to order the following measures to protect its rights pending the determination of the case on the merits
4380368 bring out of the camp the one who cursed and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head and let all the congregation stone him 15 and speak to the people of israel saying whoever curses his god shall bear his sin 16
4380369 i am a citizen of those whose god fights for them

4380373 speak to the people of israel and say to them
4380374 you shall count seven weeks of years seven times seven years so that the time of the seven weeks of years shall give you forty nine years

4380381 the marketing people for these companies are smart and they go after the top athletes the gold medalists
4380382 so someone who is finishing lower in the rankings if they see the gold medalist wearing this new suit they are going to want to try it out as well
4380383 they looked at fish and sharks and tried to recreate a surface that is similar to what they would have on their skin
4380384 its similar to the non stick frying pans you use to cook your eggs if you have a smooth surface then instead of water sticking to the suit which would cause friction it slides along it with less friction the athlete then is able to move faster
4380385 but youd have to be very stupid to be caught by in competition testing these days
4380386 the real value of testing is the out of competition testing which is effective and a deterrent
4380387 they were on us right away as soon as the plane landed
4380388 they say they were random tests but they started with tyler christopher gary reed dylan armstrong and priscilla lopes schliep
4380389 i would like to pick my lottery numbers that randomly
4380390 theyre aggressive they stay in a room they challenge you and when they arrive you only have an hour to produce its why we have to know an athletes whereabouts all the time so they wont be charged with a missed test
4380391 as long as testing is out in the clear and its done equally with no exceptions our sport will be cleaner in the long run
4380392 the reality is that there are many expectations for the next 10 days
4380393 but there is also an expectation to go deeper into specific strategies to get the medals in london 2012 and beyond
4380394 and putting them together with skilled coaches in the environment where theyre most likely to be successful
4380395 there is a spare land line capacity of 60 000 in the district and a spare capacity of 30 000 for wll which could help provide instant connections to as many persons

4380397 i send greetings to those celebrating the 62nd anniversary of india s independence
4380398 led by mahatma gandhi the indian people engaged in non violent protests and campaigns in the pursuit of freedom
4380399 on august 15 1947 they achieved their goal gained their independence and became a democratic nation this accomplishment demonstrates that though freedom can be delayed it cannot be denied
4380400 it is also a time to remember the rich contributions that the indian americans have made to our country and reminds us of the close ties that our nation shares with india
4380401 laura his wife and i send our best wishes on the occasion
4380402 if they evolved recently they must have passed the ability to metabolise arsenic to each other by lateral gene transfer
4380403 it was quite tricky to culture the critters because if you give them too much arsenic its still toxic even to them but once we had figured out the right dose and gave it to them at regular intervals they flourished on the stuff
4380404 i remembered the first and second time my dogs were killed so this is a serious threat to my life
4380405 the government needs to start the process now as to curtail the growing wave of armed robberies in the country i think the issue of fighting armed robbers should be one of the major priorities of government because we went to school for long time now back in the country to contribute our quotas in the midst of sacrifices we are making it is completely unacceptable for these bad guys to threaten us as government officials

4380407 these indian vendors are increasingly being considered for strategic service deals and will augment or in some cases replace todays acknowledged megavendors by revenue in this space by 2011
4380408 the emerging megavendors have more than doubled their revenue in a four year period with the 2007 revenue being 2 6 times the 2004 revenue
4380409 the nuclear agreement that we are negotiating with developed countries will end indias nuclear isolation it will open up new opportunities for trade in dual use high technologies and nuclear materials and equipment opening up new pathways to accelerate industrialization of our country it will enable us to provide electricity to meet the needs of our farmers our artisans our traders and our industry
4380410 we must apply modern science and technology to find long term solutions to our energy problem our crude oil and gas reserves are limited we must find alternative energy sources i would like our scientists and engineers to find ways in which we can make better use of solar energy wind energy biogas and other sources of energy
4380411 all over the world there is growing realization of the importance of atomic energy to meet the challenge of energy security and climate change it is a clean environmental friendly and renewable source of energy indias atomic scientists and technologists are world class they have developed nuclear energy capacities despite heavy odds
4380412 we have inadequate production of uranium the quality of our uranium resources is not comparable to those of other producers many countries have imposed sanctions on trade with india in nuclear materials nuclear equipment and nuclear technology as a result our nuclear energy programme has suffered
4380413 mtnl which has 2 6 lakh broadband customers in delhi plans to attract more customers with this reduction
4380414 the younger generation should be aware of legends like p u chinnapa thygaraja bhagavadhar and the man who produced the first tamil film nataraja mudaliayar
4380415 this book has been written in english because people in other countries are now closely watching indian cinema this will help them know about our cinema legends
4380416 our doors are always open and will continue to be open for anyone interested in dialogue i invite everyone to join us to discuss the problems of the state of jammu and kashmir so that its people can lead a life of peace and dignity if violence continues then our response too will be hard
4380417 as long as they continue their terrorist attacks our armed forces will be alert and give them a fitting response
4380418 it is our humanitarian obligation that we assist the state in all possible ways so that the people there can live in peace and harmony
4380419 in this conflict common citizens may also be affected at times i have said before and i am repeating once again that there is no issue that cannot be resolved through a process of discussion and dialogue
4380420 in this hour of crisis divisive politics will lead us nowhere i appeal to all political parties to keep the long term interests of jammu and kashmir in view and come together to find a permanent solution to the problems of the state
4380421 i am confident the gdp growth will be close to 8 per cent this year
4380422 factors inimical to growth included the sharp rise in global commodity inflation especially food and crude oil and tightening in credit and equity markets following the subprime loan crisis in the us
4380423 it is still possible for inflation to climb further up it could touch 13 per cent but by december it will start declining and possibly moderate to 8 9 per cent by march 2009 with coordinated policy action
4380424 if i get the health departments recommendations in the morning our department will study the proposals take the decision and clear it by evening
4380425 we have not attacked anybody we ourselves ran for our life some of our friends are still missing 8 9 farmers are in one hospital and 2 died in apollo hospital we don t know anything about others
4380426 those who were responsible for disrupting law and order have been identified and till now 19 people have been arrested under various sections law and order situation in the area is absolutely normal
4380427 terrorism extremism communalism and fundamentalism have emerged as major challenges to the unity and integrity of our country the recent terrorist attacks in bangalore ahmedabad jaipur and other parts of the country have shocked the nation what words can i find to condemn such acts of barbarism i share the sorrow and grief of people affected by terrorism the government of india will take concrete steps to rehabilitate and help such families
4380428 we wish all our neighbours well we welcome the strengthening of democratic forces in our neighbourhood especially in bhutan nepal and pakistan the recent blasts in our embassy in kabul july 7 have cast a shadow over our efforts to normalize relations with pakistan and to bring a lasting and honourable peace in our region i have personally conveyed my concern and disappointment to the government of pakistan
4380429 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take the terrorists and those who support them are enemies of the people of india and pakistan of friendship between the two countries and of peace in the region and the world we must defeat them
4380430 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated let us resolve today to stand together to strengthen the unity and integrity of our country and to stand firm in our determination to build a new india of our dreams
4380431 i commend our security forces and intelligence agencies for the dedication with which they are dealing with the problem under difficult circumstances but i agree that we have to further strengthen our intelligence agencies and police forces to deal with the problem of terrorism
4380432 whatever resources are required will be provided whatever manpower is required will be provided we are firm in our resolve to meet the challenge of terrorism i urge the state governments all political parties civil society groups and social and religious leaders to cooperate with us in rooting out terrorism from our country
4380433 i am confident that we will overcome these challenges but this requires hard work and unity of purpose this requires a politics of consensus not confrontation this requires dialogue among communities not discord the challenge of communalism of extremism and of terrorism cannot be won by a nation divided
4380434 we have nothing to eat the place where we used to sleep we are cooking there and if a vehicle passes by the house it splashes more water into the house the situation is very critical here
4380435 wherever you go the situation is the same in patna it is very difficult for the children it is pathetic
4380436 students need to comprehend that it is lack of judgment not only lack of skill that increases the risk of injury to ones self and others not wanting something bad to happen is simply not enough in addition to giving teens the knowledge and teaching them the technical skills injury prevention programs must also address teens attitudes about being immune to illness and death as a means of changing high risk behaviours such as driving while impaired

4380449 i think you have to be realistic as to how incredible this effort is
4380450 it has to do with his physical ability his ability to race his ability to keep his focus to get excited when he needs to get excited to get down when he needs to get down

4380466 la fifa est punto de resolver estos casos porque son jugadores sin contrato la fmf fue avisada por un comunicado que los clubes argentinos tienen de plazo hasta ma ana viernes para soltar el pase el de grecia insiste en que tienen raz n pero yo creo que fallar n a favor de indios y de malague o pero hay que esperar lo que diga la fifa
4380467 y si en un a o los clubes que reclaman a estos jugadores no demuestran que tienen raz n los pases provisionales se convertir an en definitivos pero el jugador ya estar a actuando es lamentable que suceda este tipo de cosas pobres muchachos y pobres equipos que invirtieron dinero y no pueden utilizarlos

4380500 isra miraj itu mengingatkan kita kepada kearifan nabi muhammad saw dalam berdakwah
4380501 some of these roles have been new to these guys and when you start putting guys in different roles it takes guys a while to react to that
4380502 i think our fans expect us to play good they come to the game wanting us to win and why shouldnt they thats why they come to the game they pull for us to win and when we lose and things like that and were not doing good more than likely in philadelphia theyre going to boo you but they do that everywhere else too
4380503 if you want to know the truth i think its a good test for our team
4380504 if you stay in the hunt and you battle it out and we win i think that tells us what kind of team we are theres two ways to look at it if we get down and we dont come back were not champions and were not men
4380505 were busting our rear ends its not like were trying to lose
4380506 we got outpitched outplayed you dont get swept in a series if the other team doesnt outplay you
4380507 its tough man everybodys going out there were trying right now its just kind of unexplainable
4380508 were not getting a lot of hits and getting key hits when we need them right now its just weird ive never really been a part of anything like this before
4380509 whoever controls the past controls the future and whoever controls the present controls the past
4380510 getting these guys is equal to making a big trade like milwaukee getting cc sabathia
4380511 if they johnson and sanchez pitch like 2006 well be in the hunt until the final out
4380512 it was kind of cool to sit back there and watch all that happen
4380513 that was the first time that i tried doing it i was all in
4380514 i dont believe ive ever seen that especially between two pitchers
4380515 i dont believe ive ever seen four in a row between two pitchers and that many runs given up in a one run ballgame with two outs
4380516 you see a lot of special things whether its a guy hitting his 500th home run this was more like you probably wont see it again you might see it once if you play the game for 10 or 15 years
4380517 the first two you dont feel it the third one is the one you start feeling it three in a row
4380518 we havent gotten to this point on the back of any one player
4380519 a lot of times fans worldwide in general they say well you are making all this money you are supposed to take it or i paid to come to the game so i can let you know anything and say anything i want
4380520 well i have kids ive got a wife ive got mom and dad before i was a ballplayer i was a person and i am a person the same way you are so you say something as a person forget the uniform as a person i could say something back but because of the uniform i the fans can say anything i want to you and thats your armor thats your shield its just not true not at all
4380521 i might catch some flak for saying this but you know theyre front runners when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you
4380522 its not me its booing the guy who is out there working hard and busting his butt
4380523 thats when i really get upset ive always said that whatever you want to do against me i can deal with myself and im sure he could deal with it too but thats my teammate i know the work he is putting in i see what he is doing trying to get better and you are crushing him thats what makes me upset
4380524 in the 8 years weve been getting closer and closer last year we finally got over one obstacle and we are still working to get over another one
4380525 and its our fault as players for saying well we understand why because of this
4380526 i never want them to win as long as im playing dont get me wrong but take the team that you have and push them to be better dont take black friday i just found that out dont take black friday and put it on these new guys half of them dont even know it i didnt know it until 15 minutes ago 20 minutes ago black friday i was like is that like palm sunday you know about the history of the team dont get me wrong but when you are there you are trying to change that for that time period my tenure here were we successful thats all you can control
4380527 i dont think right at this moment hes a dl possibility
4380528 i dont need to talk about the all star game

4380540 our engineers continue to work around the clock to restore normal operations in the meantime were notifying affected customers via personal e mail and weve posted a notice on the netflix web site were as frustrated about this as you are and we once again apologize for the inconvenience
4380541 we live in some wonderful areas like the hills of berkeley or oakland or downtown san francisco but many of these areas are geographically challenged for cell phone service
4380542 i dont think thats a great way to undertake good customer relations

4380544 an effective response rate of seven out of seven is remarkable
4380545 if this type of response rate can be replicated at these durations it could be a very effective therapy
4380546 the picture is completely absolutely 100 per cent on schedule on time there were no delays

4380554 get the notion of counting things out of your system
4380555 the more we learn about anything the more we have to tune the vocabulary we use to describe it
4380556 how many scientists get to have their business in the op ed pages in comic strips
4380557 its that debate that exposure of issues to people thats more important
4380558 this is helping to expose a little bit more of the messy side of science this clash of ideas and its a good positive thing
4380559 the time has come to discard the useless words and reinvent an entire system to respect the level of science we have achieved
4380560 were interested in which objects exhibit similar characteristics so that when we send spacecraft out into the solar system we can understand these things better
4380561 keep the game tight is what i wanted and the guys came through
4380562 as far as being able to go out and do the things he wants to do hes been able to do that
4380563 thats so much better than a number on a scale

4380567 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4380568 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4380569 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4380570 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4380571 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4380572 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4380573 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw
4380574 no decisions have been taken denying the mere fact of carrying out this action
4380575 so far only one state announced a possible variant having done it not very distinctly other states according to data available to us are assiduously preparing for it
4380576 you have stated on several occasions that russia was the first to launch an assault on georgia but on august 8 the majority of tv channels broadcast footage where georgia attacked south ossetia
4380577 first georgia was in control of south ossetias major part and thus couldnt attack it we responded with firing at tskhinvali after soldiers from that city had killed our peace keepers and civilian population this is what happened the tanks russian tanks kommersant moved from the north and it was necessary to use long range artillery not to allow them to enter the enclaves that we controlled and we did it in response they opened mortar fire and we used artillery once again
4380578 our air force twice bombarded the roksky tunnel we tried to stop a column of russian tanks and managed to drop a few bombs but we didnt bomb tskhinvali i know what i say we really bombed the roksky tunnel and with that halted russias tanks for a while i prohibited our military to use aviation against tskhinvali and shell buildings other than those administrative i controlled it myself i ordered that they should report to me every two hours the city of tskhinvali was destroyed by the russian air force after russias soldiers entered it there were so many bombs dropped that there is simply no city anymore russia succeeded in turning it into another grozny demonstrating once again its attitude toward the people of ossetia and the world as a whole you cant sacrifice minor ethnic groups for the sake of your exaggerated geopolitical ambitions its my principal position but i think that russia has no interest in south ossetia what is happening in georgia is a clear cut attempt to topple the government and restrict or eliminate georgias independence
4380579 as you gave an order to annihilate the bases from which in your view fire was opened on georgias settlements did you think that youd have to deal with russia in the end
4380580 russia had spent three months preparing for it it built the infrastructure both in abkhazia and south ossetia it built a base in java it issued leaflets for the russian army describing the way they should free georgia from my yoke the preparation for the war was obvious and absolutely barefaced they chose the perfect time the olympics i was to depart on that day and if i hadnt put off my departure it all would have caught me unawares on board the plane meanwhile the worlds leaders were in beijing bush spent four days there while the situation developed sarkozy was there and the rest too perfect time by that day russias railroad construction troops in abkhazia had finished the repair of the railways and the abkhaz infrastructure was ready their goal was creating at least two enclaves completely free from georgians and creating a buffer zone round those enclaves and suppress georgia economically too and topple the government we received this data from our partners intelligence services a few months before the operation was started we had no precise numbers only the outline of russias doctrine so it was not surprising to us at all
4380581 maybe you shouldnt have kicked against the pricks cancelling the ceasefire moratorium
4380582 we had no other way out russia was going to swallow georgia as it had once done now we wont get swallowed not only shall we preserve our sovereignty well also drive out russias forces from georgia whatever the cost i am not going to make any concessions to putins regime
4380583 with the help of our people and the friends throughout the world it was suggested to me you may stay in power all you need to do is agree to the open status of south ossetia and abkhazia no never you can rest assured georgia will never yield a centimeter of its territory to russia or anyone else well fight to the bitter end the people of georgia have demonstrated brilliant self mastery at the moment when 1200 tanks furrowed our land only advanced peoples are able to keep cool we have rapidly developed within the 15 years and russia has somehow missed it this time it caused quite a tragedy many people died
4380584 russia reports at least 2 000 thousand killed people in south ossetia as a result of georgias shelling
4380585 utter nonsense there were no 2 000 people there russia had evacuated all women and children our army had practically no contacts with civilian population all villages were empty if anyone stayed in tskhinvali they could only die from russias aviation so its a lie a big lie just like their assertion that we launched an assault on them as germany attacked poland it also asserted that it was poland that attacked first as the ussr attacked finland stalin claimed that mannerheim attacked first such things always start with a big lie perhaps they havent learnt anything except for using the principles described in all those textbooks of totalitarian regimes its a classic scheme
4380586 did it take you much time and effort to seek george bushs help
4380587 this is no help america has just taken control of our airports and ports its a hallmark in the present campaign and in the geopolitics of the region on the whole
4380588 why didnt the usa take you under its umbrella immediately
4380589 no one knew that russia will go beyond humanity and unleash the hostilities even the ussr didnt do such things russia has incurred so much loss upon georgia its infrastructure peoples lives but russias reputation in the world has been affected more the russian government is heading to a pit theyll have difficulty getting out of russia is a great country but its authorities behave in an inappropriate manner
4380590 are you going to oust russias troops with the help of americans
4380591 i didnt mean it we consider russias troops occupation ones and no occupier will feel at ease on the georgian territory aggressors and invaders must get out russia could have georgia as a friend but now i dont know how many centuries it will take to let the georgian society recover russias jets like carrion crows flew over us and threw their bombs it wont be erased from the memory of the georgian people
4380592 russias government has stated that it wont have any contacts with you anymore it means that the status quo in south ossetia and abkhazia will remain for a long time
4380593 were not going to conduct talks about our territorial integrity with russia russia has violated it and now we can have negotiations about one thing only the withdrawal of russias troops we are ready to discuss all other matters ceasefire and things like that but russia wont acknowledge georgias independence and its integrity under such circumstances its difficult to begin talks as soon as it gets back to the initial positions and acknowledges the united georgia and its borders itll be easy to negotiate now we can only conduct talks about normalizing the situation and putting an end to the monstrous crimes committed in our country
4380594 arent you afraid that world war 3 may start because of you
4380595 ive seen so much vileness within a few days that im not afraid of anything
4380596 the intent behind it is not only to do activities but to really make young people teens included informed users of the environment so they can take responsibility and make informed decisions
4380597 the san francisco bay is alive and it is critical to protect it
4380598 when youre teaching people about their own community and in this case its about their watershed it also helps to get outside
4380599 beginning last year we resolved there would be no more driving to school and driving home
4380600 we found we could cover 10 miles a day as a family without much challenge
4380601 they really helped bridge the gap from what was just going on at school to what was going on at home too
4380602 i think its just funner um more fun than riding in a car all day
4380603 instead of sitting down all buckled up you get to feel the air and see pretty plants
4380604 china doet het het beste op de olympische spelen en heeft dus de meeste medailles
4380605 i think when we set out to do over 1 000 in a year we didnt realize how rapid a growth rate that was for this area
4380606 we are still looking to grow to 1 000 jobs we just dont have a specific timeline to do that
4380607 were having significant problems in lafayette filling open call center positions as well as many other positions in the area
4380608 were facing a tough scenario where there doesnt appear to be enough qualified people
4380609 what were having trouble finding is people who are customer service oriented
4380610 these are good jobs for people trying to enter the workforce
4380611 weve got to make sure everyone in acadiana whos eligible knows about them
4380612 ashleys rehabbing very hard thats where shes at right now
4380613 she obviously had some issues this summer with the shoulder but shes in good hands
4380614 when she gets here well see dr duval and see what the protocol is from there
4380615 for the average american these inflation numbers are very bad news it means that their purchasing power has been cut and their wages arent going very far
4380616 all of their costs are rising very quickly and they are getting hammered
4380617 were retired and you can see it in the grocery stores
4380618 its the membership that picks the winners not the national board and not the le cajun board
4380619 some are misconstrued on that because they think its the national board thats picking it
4380620 la tactique sera simple il faudra essayer de se mettre labri et de g rer notre avance
4380621 et si on est en avance il faudra aussi essayer de capitaliser le but est d tre devant tout le temps
4380622 dann habe ich mich umgedreht und alles war sch n
4380623 ich dachte ich bin in einem traum wache gleich auf und stehe dann auf dem startblock
4380624 ich habe mich nur auf mich konzentriert bin mit geschlossenen augen geschwommen
4380625 theyre still going to fight theyre still going to fight for years to come
4380626 theyve still got cockfighting in every state they just hide it from the law
4380627 cockfighting may still be going on with much smaller venues in the back woods but my understanding is there hasnt been any big activity since the gambling ban
4380628 can you imagine putting a man in jail taking him away from his family and job because what he used to do to support his family is now illegal
4380629 i am so sad to see a multi million dollar industry in an economically depressed place like st landry just ripped out of our culture and out of out economy
4380630 louisiana has too much potential to build their economy on activities such as cockfighting
4380631 were losing out on an opportunity to keep our heritage and our culture
4380632 i always look for him because if i know hes there its like i know it will be ok
4380633 when i came back i just didnt set my expectations very high
4380634 i dont know if anyone really expected anything from me i was shocked at how well i did
4380635 i knew it meant id be going to the olympics i had tears in my eyes
4380636 my mom was in the stands and she came down and joined me on the floor
4380637 nobody told me id be good at it i just started doing it one day and i did it well
4380638 any talented sports kids will veer off here and there
4380639 usually you can tell when they walk through the door if they have the talent
4380640 but the real question is do they have it in them are they willing to put the work into it
4380641 thats when a lot of them quit its not all about having talent some of the ones who have the most talent dont make it because they dont work as hard they think they can just rely on their talent
4380642 i moved to lafayette because i liked it a lot down here
4380643 the gym was wonderful and i still think that its one of the best tumbling gyms in the united states
4380644 hes knowledgeable and experienced hes given so much help to the u s as a whole
4380645 if it wasnt for them sending me everywhere i probably wouldnt be doing what im doing now
4380646 chris called and said pack your bags youre going to china
4380647 i thought it would be too expensive but those guys found a way to get me out there
4380648 wenn wir langsamer fuhren wurde auch der volvo langsamer beschleunigten wir gab er auch gas

4380650 were coming up on the back half of the games
4380651 so well remain optimistic and of course well cheer for everybody who wears the maple leaf
4380652 i have failed those who trusted me i failed as a father to my children and a husband to my wife
4380653 by viewing what i viewed and doing nothing to stop it i failed as a human being
4380654 so when newfoundland finally joined together with us in confederation in 1867 we all say it was like a family reunion
4380655 weve been at the forefront of getting programs operational and weve recycled now hundreds of tonnes of electronics
4380656 weve been at the forefront of getting programs operational and weve recycled now hundreds of tonnes of electronics
4380657 we talk about it all the time but its really really true
4380658 they really think that because theyre young that they could survive anything that young people dont die in hospitals its only old people that die in hospital even if youre in an accident
4380659 hes really pleased he thought it was good news i think hes hopeful
4380660 its another chance for us to argue why the u s officials should be held liable for sending maher to syria to be tortured and i think its a great sign that the court decided to rehear the case on their own
4380661 so when newfoundland finally joined together with us in confederation in 1867 we all say it was like a family reunion
4380662 even in their absence the court believes it has authority to proceed with the case
4380663 when she looked at it she determined that due to flooding the river could actually could have been up to that level where the bones were found at that time it deserved a second look
4380664 all these years its been a very long struggle even looking at the river sometimes doesnt feel right
4380665 i guess i am glad that they have this kind of technology now
4380666 when she looked at it she determined that due to flooding the river could actually could have been up to that level where the bones were found at that time it deserved a second look
4380667 all these years its been a very long struggle even looking at the river sometimes doesnt feel right
4380668 i guess i am glad that they have this kind of technology now
4380669 at the end of all that process the dna remaining inside the bone samples themselves is in very poor shape and it makes it very difficult to retrieve any dna out of it
4380670 for instance if we have some found human remains and we develop a mitochondrial dna type from there we can now compare that type to suspected brothers or sisters of that individual we can also look at mothers and aunts or female cousins along that line
4380671 i have a plane to catch mr szabo why dont you want to hear from me pat
4380672 while im not going to comment about those specific allegations its my view that anyone who is illegally involved in diverting water in the murray darling system during this crisis is engaging in an act of terrorism against the people of australia
4380673 it is a criminal offence and anyone siphoning water off illegally in my view should be locked up rather than the fines that i am told are currently in place
4380674 anyone who is doing this sort of thing is unbelievably treacherous to the national interest and its an act of terrorism against the australian people
4380675 you have been found not guilty you are discharged from these proceedings and you are free to go
4380676 you should not have any second thoughts about your decision
4380677 you will never be better informed than you are at this moment
4380678 i have a plane to catch mr szabo why dont you want to hear from me pat

4380680 dnd does not employ compass security or uspi and neither does the foreign affairs department

4380683 me voy a reunir con el presidente de bolivia evo morales y con algunos m s tambi n
4380684 i would see this as very on line with what forster recommended
4380685 he recommended a flatter structure greater performance greater accountability increased transparency and ensuring that the majority of our 8 5 billion budget is directed at clinical services
4380686 this will allow larger and better resourced districts to deliver local health services and important hospital building programs
4380687 more than anything people are saying to me there is confusion and some lack of clarity which can be rectified and there needs to be a decision as to where the accountabilities lie
4380688 waiting lists have continued to grow and not enough new beds have been delivered despite numerous promises rhetoric and now more restructuring
4380689 the health minister and his new director general should stop wasting time and tinkering at the edges of the departments organisational structure
4380690 saya tidak mau berjuang lebih luas dulu sebelum saya sendiri mampu mengatasi kondisi anak anak saya
4380691 the sunderland fans dream about playing in europe and we should aim to get there why not
4380692 i think we have a team to finish in the top eight the lads did a good job last year and we have some quality new signings i really think we can do something we just need to believe in ourselves
4380693 this can be a really big club we have a big game on saturday a fantastic game and we can show people what were about and where we want to go
4380694 i want to be a legend here i feel good and im happy to wake up and come to training here at sunderland
4380695 why not score on saturday i would love to do it but if i get an assist for a team mate and we win that is just as good i play for the team and work hard for them
4380696 i have nothing to prove people know el hadji diouf is a good player thats it the liverpool defender who is up against me he will know i have the magic to score or give an assist
4380697 people say it is a tough start but for me its just one game in the premier league season its the same if i play liverpool newcastle or bolton i play to win
4380698 im getting there i would expect all our new signings to start in terms of the three ex tottenham lads and dioufy
4380699 my decision to leave manchester city last summer has paid off because i have got straight back into the premiership at the first attempt
4380700 i am a lot different as a player and a person now to how i was 12 months ago and hopefully i can show that
4380701 i like the way adebayor plays he is a great player with great strengths there are a lot of players in the premier league that you can take tips off and hopefully i will be able to become one of those top strikers
4380702 kev is a great player and his departure puts more pressure on the rest of the strikers to score
4380703 it is a difficult task so we have to pull together and get the job done
4380704 players could become star struck but it is football at the end of the day and 11 versus 11
4380705 anything can happen and hopefully we can give it our all and get something out of the game
4380706 if i could score a goal at the emirates it would top any other goal that i have scored
4380707 i can confidently say he can score goals in the spl and the championship because weve played hibs and sheffield wednesday now well see if he can score goals in the premier league
4380708 hes scored goals for every team hes played for and that includes his country he just wants to score goals and we think that weve unearthed one
4380709 if you can unearth a striker its like swimming the channel theres a lot of expectation on him and im sure hell do okay
4380710 we took on the two german teams very early in our preparations but its stood us in good stead
4380711 since then our pre season has gone great were delighted with the way weve played so lets hope we can take it to upton park tomorrow
4380712 justru harus mendapatkan treatment atau rehabilitasi supaya kembali normal lagi
4380713 we all know that most teams prefer to stay away from newly promoted teams in the early part of the season because they often start like a house on fire
4380714 i cant say that is a draw if you like we would have chosen but you play every team twice and take each team as they come
4380715 hull might not be one of the teams tipped for one of the top places but we are fully aware that they will be firing on all cylinders and we will have to be at our best to get a result
4380716 im sure we will be nervous as they will be and it will be an exciting encounter
4380717 im sure hull will be counting on that but it wont be the only time during the season we will have to face that situation
4380718 we will have to go to places like anfield and there are plenty of grounds where the atmosphere is going to be fierce and the support fanatical
4380719 we have to come to terms with that and it is part of the beauty of the game
4380720 if hulls supporters can help them to win games then congratulations to them but i would like to think we are strong enough to cope
4380721 we are going to treat hull with the respect they deserve after having a great season and getting promoted through the play offs which is a tough thing to do
4380722 we are preparing for a match that will test us to the limit

4380732 steve hadley the u s national security adviser voiced objections to ahmadinejads trip when he visited ankara a month ago
4380733 the attitude was weve allowed them to host manouchehr mottaki and saeed jalili respectively irans foreign minister and chief nuclear negotiator but having ahmadinejad was sending the wrong signal
4380734 however the turks explained that he had been pressing for a visit to turkey for a while and that they couldnt say no any longer to meet american reservations they promised they wouldnt sign any major energy deals apart from maybe something on electricity and would pressure ahmadinejad to accept the u n security council incentive package in exchange for suspending uranium enrichment
4380735 it is our neighbor after all its realpolitik we are obliged to this evil
4380736 we are planning it it depends on many factors i cant give you the date we have stopped building up troops
4380737 we are not there to defend the ports we are there to provide humanitarian aid
4380738 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4380739 georgia is an independent and sovereign state and i think this formula the principle of sovereignty is broader than the formula of territorial integrity
4380740 the debt standard accreditation demonstrates to our clients both individuals experiencing financial difficulties and creditors seeking the best returns from their debtors that we are committed to finding the best solutions for them
4380741 some areas of the debt industry have gained a dubious reputation but there are lots of companies who dont deserve to be tarred by the same brush this accreditation mark identifies the best providers in the market that customers can trust
4380742 its exciting every young guy growing up in south africa keeps a close eye on the county game and always read about the lords final being the highlight i never ever dreamed i would be a part of one
4380743 its huge theres no doubt that wherever you go in the cricket world everyones aware of the greatness of lords anyone who knows about cricket knows how big a deal it is
4380744 for my first few years here getting to a lords final seemed miles away so this is a huge day the guys have certainly put in the work over the last few years in developing into a one day outfit
4380745 the players themselves two years ago were pretty disappointed with their one day performances we had lots of discussions on how to get better there was a pooling of ideas with the experienced players in the set up to improve our one day cricket
4380746 the final thing is we have a brilliant captain who is excellent in one day cricket he is able to keep the necessary calmness on the day one day cricket is a tough game to captain because it moves so quickly
4380747 we are just trying to play it down and see it as another days cricket we will treat it like a normal one day game try and go about our business in much the same way the same preparations thats been the way we have played the big games over the last few years go out and hopefully have some fun we dont see it as anything different if its got us this far why should we change it

4380749 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4380750 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4380751 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4380752 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4380753 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4380754 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4380755 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4380765 the situation we face is a situation of stagnation and steep slowdown
4380766 the german economy has got to get through a rough patch for growth in the coming months
4380767 but overall theres no reason for excessive pessimism based on the development of the first half of the year
4380768 there is a good chance the economy is already in recession but even if it isnt the outlook remains for subdued growth in the quarters to come
4380769 net trade is still likely to make a small positive contribution to gdp growth this year and next
4380770 but this will be due to a weakening in import growth as the domestic economy weakens rather than a major strengthening in export growth and it will not be enough to prevent the u k from entering a recession and from activity slowing by even more than the bank of england expects
4380771 todays reports paint a similar picture sharp corrections in fixed investment and exports those having been the main engine of growth over the past few years and stagnating private consumption
4380772 for this purpose let him first read perseveringly through the kuran in any of the good translations europe possesses assisting himself by such illustrations and commentaries as may fall in his way he is not likely to find the occupation attractive first and he must be content to share the feeling of goethe the universal critic who after recounting the fabulous stories of christian and jewish religion the amplifications of every kind the boundless tautologies and repetitions that compose the body of this holy book describes it as repelling you every time you approach it then attracting you as you advance then impressing you with a feeling of astonishment and at last forcing from you a sense of respect and admiration

4380784 i have expectations that north korea will come forward for comprehensive dialogue and economic cooperation because now is the most opportune time for the north to make change
4380785 opening the age of the pacific and the age of eurasia simultaneously a unified korea will leap toward the center of the global community
4380786 this is the first baby step for christopher neil in terms of having him held accountable for the international sex crimes he is accused of committing

4380800 on setting up diplomatic relations between the two countries at the level of ambassadors
4380801 one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4380802 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
4380803 to reactivate the work of the joint committee to demarcate the lebanese syrian borders within a mechanism and a set of priorities
4380804 it is not possible to mark the borders in shebaa farms as long as there is still israeli occupation the occupation must end
4380805 to activate and step up the work of the joint committee on people missing from both countries
4380806 to continue with the process of change in democracy and peace
4380807 the bolivian government is going to guarantee autonomy for all of bolivia but within a framework of legality and constitutionality
4380808 i feel the opposing governors only want the silver money and do not wish to deal with other matters without considering what the bolivian people think
4380809 i conclude that the bolivian people want autonomy they want a new political constitution
4380810 now no governor can talk about two thirds more than two thirds of the people want to unite the new constitution with the statutes for autonomy
4380811 its just a terrible thing to see one of your old friends pass away like that
4380812 i came out with damien last night because we wanted to say face to face to the family what had happened
4380813 we need to give the family time and space now and prepare for the funeral so we will be heading away
4380814 they tried everything they could doing cpr for two hours is pretty harrowing
4380815 its been like this as far as i can remember we build houses then fighting occurs we leave and return home and build our houses again

4380817 the prime minister never offered to absorb 20 000 refugees in israel the prime minister again reiterates that under any future agreement there will not be any return of palestinian refugees to israel in any number

4380821 im in the process of doing invisible man right now and im working with some conceptual artists in tandem with writing the script im actually working with one of the artists from batman begins and the dark knight so it could be magneto or it could be the invisible man next
4380822 continuation of a competitive investment scheme is a positive step as is further clarification of the green car fund
4380823 concern for the industrys ability to compete on a global scale
4380824 australia at 10 per cent makes it tougher for local manufacturers in competing and drawing innovation and new technology to australia
4380825 we need to look at this on a fair playing field basis theres other countries out there that value their automotive industry greatly their tariffs reflect that
4380826 in some peoples mind industry policy is only about tariffs they are wrong its an incredibly old fashioned idea
4380827 if it tariffs has to decrease wed like a more gradual decrease as an industry we are pretty united on that the tariff is a big issue for us
4380828 here at holden were turning the corner on profitability here and if we have to spend money to price compete with some of the people that bring products at very low cost into this country it diverts some of our reinvestment opportunities in the future
4380829 recognises the complexities of the industry in a global framework
4380830 as far as being able to go out and do the things he wants to do hes been able to do that
4380831 thats so much better than a number on a scale

4380835 the left hand trait is really impressive for how fluid secure and precise it is
4380836 despite all the perplexity that it may cause also regarding the lack of information on its provenance the work is at least for now the most important find since the identification of the lady with an ermine
4380837 there were only very few artists of that caliber then
4380838 there are collectors who keep these works of art in bank vaults but it is likely that well find others
4380839 we know of artworks that have been documented and that we havent found yet
4380840 for the first time in my life i was amazed by the mastery with which putin is able to hold onto power
4380841 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located we wont allow the deaths of our compatriots go unpunished
4380842 in any case i think this too is an indirect indication of who is more important in this ruling tandem
4380843 you see thugs differ from normal people in that when they smell blood its hard for them to stop
4380844 otherwise people would begin to call into question his ability to run the country and accuse him of being spineless
4380845 the political process can always be looked at either through a telescope or a microscope
4380846 if you look up close of course much is changing but if you take the longer view it turns out that the system was totalitarian and continues to be totalitarian
4380847 last time i was here they made it for me this way
4380848 that shield is certainly putting a crimp in my day
4380849 government security contracts in the iraq theater have cost taxpayers at least 3 billion dollars since the war began but offer substantial taxpayer savings according to a report released tuesday
4380850 in the past everything was grown together and we often didnt even know what grapes were going into the blend
4380851 today its important to communicate that we dont only have one wine
4380852 its true that the overall alcohol levels in vinho verde are increasing
4380853 not only is there the influence of global warming but the vineyards are now planted more properly with the right varieties and were seeing more work and care in the vines
4380854 with the new systems of viticulture we can get higher levels of alcohol and more ripeness but we still try to preserve the classic style
4380855 loureiro is best near the atlantic where its light fresh and very aromatic
4380856 azal gives citrusy aromas while arinto usually has green apple flavors with good structure and richness
4380857 alvarinho needs at least six or seven months in the bottle and preferably even one year
4380858 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
4380859 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
4380860 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
4380861 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
4380862 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
4380863 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
4380864 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
4380865 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
4380866 ranting about how americans and israelis are the real terrorists and that democracy is really fascist
4380867 until rotberg responded that he would not be called a f ing jew
4380868 the store manager came over to me and told me not to swear i told him that i was the one being sworn at he said that it didnt matter he gathered up the books on the table and escorted me to his office at the back
4380869 because these totalitarians just stopped my right to lecture and are swearing at me and who knows what they will do next
4380870 i heard you said some things at the lecture just as objectionable as what was said to you we are going to issue our own press release and you may not be happy with what it says
4380871 i heard that you said that all muslims are terrorists
4380872 i definitely did not say that if you put out a press release with such nonsense i will sue to protect my reputation
4380873 inappropriate behavior and racist comments both from the guest author and some of the attendees at this particular event
4380874 a racist is a conservative winning an argument with a liberal
4380875 has little to do with the facts but with what she thinks i must think of her
4380876 it is hard enough to exercise freedom of speech when your unpopular opinions expose you to physical intimidation
4380877 but when you cant get any backing or support it becomes a martyrs game
4380878 i feel that only now after four years with the trial upcoming and the country waking up to the mark steyn are people waking up to what happened to me and what it means
4380879 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
4380880 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
4380881 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
4380882 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
4380883 new book out and making the move to open access
4380884 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
4380885 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
4380886 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
4380887 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
4380888 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
4380889 for mild to moderate cases of neuroma treatment options include
4380890 the cocktail to blame is the super dry vodka martini
4380891 almost 75 percent of my vodka martini drinkers are very very afraid of vermouth
4380892 they dont even know what it tastes like but a friend who gave them their first dirty martini didnt use it so they dont want it in there
4380893 by the 1890s its like every drink has vermouth in it
4380894 people dont like it nobody drinks it straight and its used in a few cocktails the most important of which is the martini and when making martinis people dont use it
4380895 youd smell it and imagine yourself being transported to a mountain meadow
4380896 my objective from the very beginning was to make something that people would enjoy drinking straight
4380897 we continue to try to get people to think of it on its own but so far that doesnt seem to be happening
4380898 this is going to sound totally dorky but i did a vermouth intensity chart where i rate them from the most to least intense
4380899 that boldness when youre using half an ounce in a cocktail it showcases your vermouth rather than losing it
4380900 when i try to use the carpano antica or the vya i really have to think whats going on here
4380901 the carpano antica is a linebacker and the cinzano is a soccer player theyre both muscular but one lets you know when it hits you
4380902 theres so much flavor going on in the antica and even the texture it makes its presence known if youre using it you need to have something big strong and bold enough to go up against it or youre going to have to really cut back in its proportions
4380903 in that case you want a strong bourbon and a strong vermouth that can help tame down the absinthe
4380904 i think vermouths most important attribute is its alcohol content
4380905 its not much more than wine and it helps tone down big gnarly spirits like whiskey and gin even tequila
4380906 martini amp rossi is the only vermouth for a negroni period
4380907 its the only one that can handle the campari on a 1 to 1 ratio the sugar levels just arent there in the more esoteric vermouths so martini amp rossi is what i use for that one and i serve a hell of a lot of negronis
4380908 since the wine was getting a little old i wasnt going to crush anything by adding botanicals to it
4380909 there was no delicate balance i was going to screw up
4380910 i have three guests who drink this exclusively before dinner ive actually set bottles aside for them because i know ill run out by the end of the summer
4380911 youll make a drink that seems like its missing something and its a running joke that you just add sweet vermouth to it
4380912 i always order a wet martini when i go out these days
4380913 people used to look at me like i was insane but now theyve clearly heard of it
4380914 people have an aversion to vermouth and quite frankly its well founded
4380915 even if you keep your vermouth in the fridge after a week youll notice it has a different flavor if you keep that vermouth on a shelf its going to taste terrible thats why people dont like vermouth
4380916 i am totally loyal to this company and would not think of working for anyone else
4380917 so am i unless i can get a better offer from another company
4380918 coupled with his being unburdened by the old dogmas allowed him to outperform his generals in the ability to see change and harness it to his purpose
4380919 behind the curve in keeping up with the global telecommunications revolution
4380920 i just dont want to create so many sales that we will not be able to handle them
4380921 hey guy just got word that we are going to increase prices by 7 and well hey tough situation take care and call me if you want to chat
4380922 law is made for everyone therefore its unprecedented violation is a dangerous precedent being set by the senate
4380923 in the absence of the president and protempore the senate secretary should nominate anyone senator to preside instead of resorting to bye election as most senators are opting
4380924 what the senate can do to regain its image is to reconsider its action base on its illegality and the outcry of the public and flouting of the constitution and for the sake of peace
4380925 the ward committee members are responsible for revenue mobilization linking various project with line ministries and take the needs of the people to the ward committee meeting so that development projects would be implemented in their communities
4380926 what i want you to know mr chairman is that our members were buried in mass grave and buried behind the ministry of gender and development they did not only bury them in mass grave but they also brought them to our door steps to abuse to humiliate us and somebody in the country say pal brought the confusion and should apologize mr chairman what is the true meaning of this commission what is it supposed to do
4380927 mr chairman i want you people to seek permission to go the post stockade to dig up that place because i am of the conviction that our members were buried there
4380928 we were arrested in march and thrown into the post stockade
4380929 they beat us and we thought that would have been the end of us
4380930 you make such a noise falling you scatter all my winter dreams
4380931 low born and low dwelling songless peevish thing you live not in the upper air and you cannot tell the sound of singing
4380932 o these autumn leaves they make such a noise they scatter all my winter dreams
4380933 now let me say this to you mr chairman when swaray came here and said he saw the president in uniform the executive mansion issued a release to that effect i expected you to have responded to the mansion and tell the president not to undermine the work of the trc you did not do that im disappointed
4380934 luomo per natura un animale egocentrico e prepotente siamo riusciti a colonizzare ogni angolo del nostro piccolo pianeta ciononostante non siamo noi lapice dellevoluzione quello un onore che spetta agli scarafaggi non a noi uno scarafaggio pu vivere per mesi senza mangiare restare in vita per settimane con la testa mozzata o resistere alle radiazioni pensiamo di essere stati creati dal signore a sua immagine e somiglianza ma forse non cos forse dio uno scarafaggio
4380935 this is a socialist country and uses a socialist system but the people are still free to believe its guaranteed in the constitution
4380936 if you have any doubts about this have a look and see how many worshippers there are look at the community theres so much been provided for muslims like schools
4380937 we get about 500 to 600 worshippers here on a friday much more than in the past
4380938 what i mean of course is that there are more mosques now the government has never controlled us
4380939 to curtail their stay in china and leave the country earlier
4380940 maybe abroad you dont understand this issue tibet is an inalienable part of chinese territory some there want a split and this is not good
4380941 i notice that most of the people in these demonstrations are non chinese so they dont understand i dont think the media should encourage this the olympics are where you come to make friends and understand each other only with this can we resolve issues and not stir up trouble
4380942 while the chinese government has built a gleaming new building for its official mouthpiece and its public relations strategy has become more sophisticated the propaganda it uses to maintain its iron fisted control over tibet remains the same
4380943 you dont look on the redeem team for the 100 meter champion
4380944 somebody that tall should not have that kind of turnover
4380945 if he gets the same start he got in new york forget about it
4380946 this year we were just planning for the 200 meters in beijing
4380947 i know everyone there expects me to set a world record
4380948 with three guys who can run 9 7 anything is possible
4380949 in order to win i have to run 9 6 most likely thats what i trained my mind to do
4380950 you see i had some friends once before whos not so much my friends anymore destruction of a person builds character
4380951 hes a very manly man and wants a boy to do guy stuff with
4380952 we will continue to reduce the number of british troops in iraq
4380953 of course future decisions will be based as i have always said on the advice of our military commanders on the ground
4380954 but just as last year we moved from combat to overwatch we would expect a further fundamental change of mission in the first months of 2009
4380955 although it is hoped that the uk military presence in iraq will decrease significantly in the future it is still too early to discuss the size and shape of a reduced uk forces footprint
4380956 in his statement to the house of commons on july 22 the prime minister set out our intent to make a fundamental change to the uk mission in iraq in the first months of 2009
4380957 as ever this will be based on conditions on the ground the plans of our coalition partners and the military contribution requested of us by the government of iraq under a long term bilateral relationship
4380958 as a key coalition partner the us is intimately involved with the development of our future plans

4380973 i dont have to really think about it im not interested in whether youre correct i dont care about the truth im certain i already have it if you want me to learn the truth you have to show it to me because im not willing to check it out on my own

4381007 canadas housing market is running into some seriously foul weather amid the weakest affordability in nearly two decades
4381008 while we still doubt that canada will stage an instant replay of the trauma in u s markets even a mild version would be bad news
4381009 we find that house prices play an important role in household spending decisions for several countries
4381010 the link is stronger in countries like australia canada the united states and the united kingdom
4381011 the apparent overvaluation of house prices in several advanced countries is an ongoing concern since a significant downturn in prices would have adverse effects for consumer spending and the aggregate economy
4381012 as it indicates that the extent of the cooling in the canadian housing market may have accelerated in july
4381013 however since the declines were mostly in the western cities where prices were not too long ago appreciating at a double digit pace we remain confident that the extent of the slowdown nationally will remain measured
4381014 there is no doubt the canadian real estate market is pulling back from the record sales and price increase levels of 2007

4381053 with rising gas prices supply increases and budget cuts small businesses need every cost saving advantage they can get their hands on to thrive in todays economy our goal with the office next door is to provide high quality and timely off site business support to clients who typically dont have the space or budget for in house staff but do have the same critical office work load as any other business
4381054 by using our services business owners have more time and money to focus on income producing activities in turn the team and i get to work from our homes and spend more time with our families instead of spending time and money commuting to an office we do the tasks small businesses need to get done and instead of incurring the expense of an in house assistant they pay us only for the hours we work everybody wins

4381056 the time we spent in france last week was an excellent bonding session for the players i only used the players who had done a full pre season with us but next week we can bring in the players who didnt feature in the games against perpignan and montpellier every available player will get a game next week as we have a curtain raiser against sedgely tigers kicking off at 6pm this game will give some of the younger players the chance to play on edgeley park for the first time
4381057 the premiership is the toughest league in the world and we will need every member of the squad to be able to step up to the mark when selected if we are to achieve our targets we are also in tough groups in the edf challenge cup and heineken cup but to be one of the leading clubs you have to play well regularly as we did when we won the championship

4381062 it is a tough league and there are some very good teams but we never got embarrassed at any stage which was good
4381063 we were a side that would always score goals but we knew we conceded too many
4381064 we have a really tough start against oldham because they are normally one of the better teams but we will give it our all
4381065 there are a lot of players who did themselves the power of good with how we performed in the last five games of last season so hopefully the new players can come in and enhance that
4381066 what these guys did is an absolutely amazing story and without them people would be a lot worse off theyre heroes every day
4381067 where resources are provided in order to directly police football matches the costs are fully recovered
4381068 currently recovery of any other associated costs is at the discretion of the divisional commander or their deputy
4381069 however the force is currently reviewing its charges for policing football matches and other events
4381070 the law is quite clear clubs pay for any policing inside the ground and on immediately adjacent property under their control on match day
4381071 any other provision deemed necessary is covered by the state its what people pay their taxes for with the premier league alone contributing more that 700million a year to the treasury let alone the tax take from the 13million fans who attend premier league games during the course of a season
4381072 we performed really well at wycombe last saturday and now i want the boys to put on a show against rotherham
4381073 it has been a tough start for us especially when we have so many new faces in the team but things are shaping up very nicely
4381074 i am not going to get carried away with getting a point on the opening day of the season but that performance at wycombe was so much better than the one we turned in there last season
4381075 that defeat still hurts me because i felt let down and the boys knew that but they put it right at the weekend and we can still improve
4381076 the new lads are still gelling in but there are good signs both on the training ground and in matches
4381077 i have said all summer that we needed that little extra know how
4381078 players here have done a fantastic job for me over the years but it became apparant that i had to improve
4381079 and i think that showed on saturday neil wainwright showed what a good player he is and we looked like a good unit with a tremendous work ethic and thats what you need in league 2
4381080 it should be a good crowd on saturday because its the first home game and i hope the fans get right behind us because they do make a difference

4381103 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

4381156 its still early to say its the end of the super cycle but if the markets continue to fall like they are doing now i am sure many people will be talking about it very soon
4381157 the region around 750 is very important because this is a long term gold uptrend support so if its broken golds really gone
4381158 i am not surprised to see a breakthrough of 800 now and i guess whats coming into play now is more technical selling below 800
4381159 well have some people targeting 750 but i think we would need to see a continuation in that dollar strength to give it sufficient momentum to head that way
4381160 near term support should be around 12 38 then 12 00s
4381161 on a more bearish note we could in fact head all the way down to 11 50s because the long term uptrend seems to be breached as of todays sharp downward movement

4381169 its a negative shock but it wont lead to a major collapse of growth or an overshooting of the exchange rate or a major financial crisis like in the 1980s and 90s
4381170 argentina is the worst off by far in that its policy mix is leveraged very significantly on commodity prices
4381171 argentina has used the extraordinary income from export taxes to boost spending so with less income wed have to cut spending or find a way to roll over debt
4381172 without oil revenues its going to be very difficult for the government to maintain the trade balance the fiscal balance and the level of government spending to keep chavezs people happy
4381173 it would likely take a sustained drop to the 65 75 per barrel range for the government to likely be forced to make difficult fiscal trade offs

4381182 at this stage it is not really an issue for me and its not an issue for the club
4381183 to be honest i havent really thought about that its not really an issue its not something that i think too much about im more worried about geelong tomorrow night
4381184 i never set out to be a 20 year coach and that certainly hasnt change

4381189 against the kangaroos in round 18 we had 12 guys who had shots at goal but we openly had three goal kickers
4381190 those small medium forwards when you get two or three shots at goal it makes an enormous difference if you kick three or none out of your three shots
4381191 purely the conversion accuracy is holding us back in terms of those small medium forwards
4381192 weve won there the last three times the players seemed to like playing at the gabba

4381203 the scale of convict transportation to australia was far greater than any other penal colony in the world whether we measure it in terms of the numbers sent the duration of the journey or the vastness of the areas settled

4381322 c mo es posible que margarito aguantara esos cantazos como si nada de hecho no soy el nico que piensa as el mismo el nuevo d a describe c mo margarito se impuso con una impresionante muestra de fortaleza resistencia y voluntad sin mostrar pice de dolor o cansancio ante las tempranas embestidas del ahora ex monarca cag e o claramente el reportero de el nuevo d a ten a la misma sospecha que yo vamos c mo t coges cantazos de miguel cotto sin mostrar un pice de dolor usando esteroides y con ayudita de afuera claro
4381323 yo creo que es bastante claro que margarito no s lo us esteroides sino que stos fueron provistos por el mism simo comandante cobra
4381324 voy a ir m s all yo creo que la siniestra mano de cobra est detr s de los ltimos reveses que ha sufrido nuestro pueblo pi nsalo son demasiado seguiditos lo de cotto que nuestro equipo nacional de baloncesto no clasificara para las olimpiadas que ingrid rivera quedara en la quincuag simonovena posici n en el certamen de miss universe y por supuesto las acusaciones contra nuestro gobernador cobra ha reconocido la importancia de puerto rico en el mundo y pretende pisotearnos
4381325 la organizaci n cobra quiere asegurar al p blico que los esfuerzos de su bienamado l der el comandante cobra est n completamente enfocados en dominar el mundo y destruir a los comandos g i joe las alegaciones de su mano en la derrota de cotto son rumores infundados tomados de comentarios sacados de contexto y para los cuales no existe fuente period stica alguna

4381327 despu s de ver la repetici n de la pelea y comprobar la paridad de fuerzas entre margarito y miguel hemos decidido que no queremos verlo en el mismo zip code en que se encuentre margarito
4381328 as que por los pr ximos meses estar haciendo ofertas fatulas dise adas para que margarito las rechace y si acaso acepta alguna de mis rid culas ofertas utilizaremos nuestros considerables recursos para comprar excusas m dicas o falsificar radiograf as que muestren huesos rotos para poder anunciar con gran pesar la cancelaci n de la pelea
4381329 de hecho ya redact mi primera oferta en la que ofrezco a margarito la oportunidad de que me pague 250 000 por pelear contra miguel en micronesia coste ndose l mismo su estad a y sus pasajes
4381330 anoche mismo me sent con evangelista cotto y comenzamos los preparativos para una revancha contra quintana o alg n otro muerto contra el que miguel pueda lucir invencible
4381331 lo importante es conseguir a alg n rival al que cotto ya le haya ganado y que cuente con una reputaci n totalmente inmerecida pero que haya pasado incre blemente incuestionada quintana definitivamente llena esos requisitos a la perfecci n
4381332 bendito mijo cu ntame cu ntos pay per views vendi esa pelea si vendi cinco mil fue mucho lo m s seguro en puerto rico todav a creen que es campe n y eso es si alguna vez se enteraron de que hab a llegado a campe n es el rival perfecto para miguel en estos momentos
4381333 durante los primeros asaltos el boxeo de miguel era demasiado para margarito por m s que trataba margarito simplemente no pod a alcanzarnos
4381334 para una revancha contra margarito de seguro continuar amos explotando esa ventaja de hecho en vez de entrenar con chatas podemos contratar un entrenador de pista y campo para trabajar con la est mina de miguel y as poder correr por m s de seis asaltos y adem s de eso en vez de ponerle zapatillas de boxeo podemos ponerle patines ah s que no nos alcanza
4381335 con que hagamos par de ajustes la revancha ser a m s pareja por ejemplo en vez de usar guantes de boxeo podemos usar dos bloques de concreto pa darle por el cocote podemos tambi n realizar la pelea en un ring circular para evitar la man a esta de miguel de quedarse parao en la esquina golpeando los pu os de margarito con su nariz
4381336 todo eso es posible definitivamente a margarito que se cuide que una vez volvamos a hacerle creer a todo el mundo que estamos al nivel de mayweather y oscar de la hoya vamos pa encima

4381340 claramente no es pol ticamente correcto poner a agentes gubernamentales persiguiendo ni os con escopetas
4381341 debe ser obvio para cualquiera que si el gobierno estuviera persiguiendo a un ente extra terrestre s lo se armar an con walkies talkies y de ninguna manera con armas de fuego con las cuales defenderse
4381342 que ya ver s c mo cambio digitalmente el disfraz que se puso e t quien francamente parece estar vestido de puta

4381353 el cambio ha sido del cielo a la tierra la ltima vez que vine fue un domingo a las nueve y no tuvimos tanta gente esper ndonos pero para hoy s bado pr cticamente desde que entramos estamos acumulando papeles flyers y brochures de cuanto vendedor nos encontramos en el pasillo evidentemente en se al de apoyo a nuestra candidatura

4381442 no hace falta decir que estaremos tomando cartas en el asunto porque este fiasco no se puede repetir de ahora en adelante todo fraude estafa o invento deber ser aprobado por el directorio del partido como en los viejos tiempos
4381443 a m lo que me pas fue que la caja que me dieron era demasiado grande y cuando me preguntaron sobre los proyectos del gobernador no pude encontrar el embuste que estaba buscando
4381444 es que nosotros en la c mara estamos acostumbrados a cajitas de zapatos que son mucho m s manejables para los embustecitos del diario
4381445 para esta campa a lo que nos repartieron fueron cajas de hacer mudanzas y para encontrar embustes all hay que estar al menos tres d as

4381450 die arznei der unsterblichkeit und ein gegengift das den tod verhindert vielmehr erm glicht fort und fort in jesus christus zu leben
4381451 denn nicht wie gew hnliches brot und gew hnlichen trank nehmen wir diese dinge sondern wie jesus christus unser heiland durch gottes wort fleisch geworden um unseres heiles willen sowohl fleisch wie blut besa so ist nach unserer lehre auch jene speise f r die mit einem auf ihn selbst zur ckgehenden gebet dank gesagt wurde und mit der sich unser fleisch und blut entsprechend der wandlung n hren fleisch und blut das fleischgewordenen jesus
4381452 es ist daher offensichtlich dass das blut christi nicht dargebracht wird wenn dem kelch der wein gebricht und das opfer des herrn nicht mittels der vorschriftsm igen weihe gefeiert wird
4381453 handelt gewiss jener priester wahrhaft als christi stellvertreter der das was christus getan hat nachahmt und er bringt gott dem vater in der kirche dann ein wahres und vollkommenes opfer dar wenn er es so darzubringen anf ngt wie er es selbst von christus dargebracht sieht

4381590 people today are afraid to be alone this fear is a dominant mark of our society many now ceaselessly sit in the cinema or read novels about other peoples lives or watch dramas why simply to avoid having to face their own existence no one seems to want and no one can find a place of quiet because when you are quiet you have to face reality but many in the present generation dare not do this because on their own basis reality leads them to meaninglessness so they fill their lives with entertainment even if it is only noise the christian is supposed to be very opposite there is a place for proper entertainment but we are not to be caught up in ceaseless motion which prevents us from ever being quiet rather we are to put everything second so we can be alive to the voice of god and allow it to speak to us and confront us

4381638 house speaker nancy pelosi on thursday firmly rejected the idea of a house vote solely on the issue of offshore oil drilling calling it a hoax on the american people backed by oil companies instead she said she wants congress to tackle a compromise comprehensive energy plan that would include alternative energy sources and curtailing tax breaks for oil companies pelosi said she wants to end what she called the failed energy policies supported by two oilmen in the white house referring to president bush and vice president dick cheney former oil company executives
4381639 the media constantly repeat the claim that it would take a decade to get the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr into oil production and about as long for offshore continental oil to start flowing most accounts promote the views of extreme environmentalists to make the issue appear so hopeless that we must instead change our way of life rather than tap into proven oil reserves in july cnn repeatedly reported that offshore drilling would take seven to 10 years to get into production yet brazils petrobras expects its new finds in extraordinarily deep waters to already be producing 100 000 barrels per day in just two years what is wrong with american oil companies that they would take so long in fact the world oil shortage is political not geological
4381640 when leases on private land pay royalties of 12 to 25 why should taxpayers only receive 12 to 16 what about decades of royalty underpayments on taxpayer owned land and indian tribal land and allotments what about the 68 million acres already being leased but not being drilled why grant more oil shale leases when the five current demonstration leases are years from producing commercially viable oil from a source whose promise of bonanza has failed three times in the past 120 years bankrupting dozens of companies and soaking up hundreds of millions of dollars in government subsidies nonetheless the rush is on and the republicans have an ace up their sleeve the ban on additional off shore leases must be renewed each year by september 30
4381641 electricity is so commonplace that no one gives any thought to not having access to it few give any consideration to how it is generated but we are now being inundated with the most virulent nonsense about how wind or solar power is clean and practically free every week theres some new proposal to cover the nation with wind farms and solar panels the problem for everyone who wants to get rich with these energy sources or those who think they are the answer to our energy needs is that neither wind nor solar can ever power anything more than relatively small projects like a farm or a local stadium a nation of more than three hundred million people however needs a lot of generation capacity
4381642 women age like fine wine the older they get the better they are
4381643 as early as 1992 the adam smith institute propagated the use of marketable permits for tackling high co2 emissions this cap and trade system means that while the government has limited the overall value of emissions firms polluters can trade their pollution permits the incentive to reduce emissions is created by the cost of buying extra permits and selling your surplus if you are more efficient so only 13 years later the eu entered phase i 2005 2007 of its emissions trading system that sought to do just that over the same time period co2 emissions in the eu rose 1 9 why does the market approach appear to have failed

4381646 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4381647 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4381648 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4381649 tomorrow is going to be a tough race for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4381650 anybody can say whatever they want but i know im clean
4381651 people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts i have the results to prove it
4381652 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4381653 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4381654 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4381655 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4381656 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4381657 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4381658 i really couldnt breathe that last 50 i was just digging deep and couldnt breathe
4381659 a silver medal is still a silver medal in the olympics i gave it everything i couldnt have given more
4381660 im very proud of how ive handled the heavier workload

4381663 that kind of money is not going to change anything however i see these initial funds as important elements to create a new economic paradigm for the amazon
4381664 it is much more important they the funds are used to develop alternatives not only for law enforcement
4381665 otherwise it will be very difficult even with large inflows of money to protect the forest because you almost need a police state you almost need the army deployed all over the amazon
4381666 it just postpones deforestation but its not a final solution the final fix is to create a new economy that can give jobs to several million people
4381667 the amazon lacks badly entrepreneurs perhaps thats the thing it lacks the most to go there with good ideas and translate biodiversity wealth into economic wealth
4381668 you can even think now of a system in which using the satellite you will spot the deforestation and a couple of months later that person if he is unable to explain that was legal immediately that person is blacklisted for loans
4381669 that will have a tremendous impact because most of the operations they depend on those loans
4381670 even if all countries stop deforestation tomorrow and then within 100 years global warming changes 4 5 degrees further then forget it the tipping point will have been reached
4381671 nanotechnology is one of the three pre eminent environmental law issues
4381672 once people get a handle on climate change theyre going to look back and say this is really the other big thing we need to be focusing on
4381673 theres interest in nanotech in the legal field because of the unknowns and the nuanced challenges it creates for existing frameworks
4381674 attorneys and law firms doing regulatory law see a fundamental disconnect between the current setup and the reality of nanomaterials the novel and fundamentally different properties they bring
4381675 the fundamental question seems to be are nanomaterials new chemicals or existing
4381676 epa decided that there is no subcategory of nanomaterials under tsca size is irrelevant
4381677 the scientific consensus on nanomaterials is that nano does not mean merely tiny but rather materials that have the capacity to act in fundamentally different ways
4381678 our concern is that health and safety research and environmental impact research is absent
4381679 the shape of litigation in nanotechnologies remains to be seen in many ways
4381680 for nano related products liability the high stakes health effects are still a ways down the road and were unlikely to see it until next generation device and pharmaceutical spaces
4381681 insurance companies and reinsurers are similarly interested like lawyers because they see this great unknown that is moving forward
4381682 insurance companies and reinsurers are ahead of the curve in terms of risk projection risk identification quantification and management but thats who they are and what they do
4381683 the big challenge is coming to grips with the fact that there is a considerable amount of ambiguity and uncertainty associated with the commercialization of nanotechnology
4381684 in the past a vacuum of regulation has proved unhelpful to insurers
4381685 lack of regulation is never helpful to liability insurers and the insurance industry should lobby for clarity
4381686 currently agencies seem to be more focused on studying the issues than regulating them
4381687 that trend may be moving toward more regulation it may be that nanotechnology transitions toward a more mandatory regulatory type scheme than what currently exists today
4381688 one of the ideas behind the project is to make csr methodologies more transparent to multiply the sources of information and to use the wisdom of the crowd
4381689 a companys reputation has a very big impact on stock prices and the reputation is what the stakeholders think about a company hence the idea of asking them to rate the companies we are not a rating agency and dont intend to become one our job is complementary to the job currently carried out by extra financial rating agencies
4381690 opensri will provide stakeholders with a method to express their opinions and promote responsible behaviour for companies in a constructive and sustainable way while offering a place where people will feel at ease to discuss and tackle relevant questions
4381691 opensri was born with the idea of a collaborative site where users spend a lot of time because they are involved in a project where every opinion has the same weight
4381692 opensri stakeholders have the ability to be heard by others and by the companies the sources are not anonymous for us but they will be anonymous for the public as all stakeholders will have a pseudonym to protect themselves but we will have the basic personal information at the moment of the registration
4381693 i think we were a touch oversold and euas were looking a bit cheap
4381694 euas should probably stabilise at current levels since we need a good reason to keep going higher
4381695 from a technical standpoint it will be difficult to close above 24 20 euros today
4381696 the link is fundamentally a negative for euas but its also a positive for the market in that it brings assurance for compliance buyers who have stayed on the sidelines until now
4381697 a much stronger incentive to use up their phase ii 2008 12 cer quota since unused quota may no longer be carried over
4381698 surplus cers can always be swapped for euas however which can then be banked
4381699 investors are likely to bank a portion of the credits in order to sell in the post 2012 market if they feel this offers better prospects

4381704 i told robin that i saw mike with some girl at the movie theater last night it just came out of my mouth like word vomit
4381705 fucking wonderful what did you come up with oh great one prophet to the gods
4381706 well thats the thing even if god exists who says he cares about any of us
4381707 if i believed in god then id probably say faith is what says he cares about any of us isnt god whatever it is supposed to be the divine creator anyways why would he stop caring about us
4381708 look in the bible i forget what book it is but its the old testament
4381709 one of the old bits talks about these people in and around isreal who commit these horrendous sins rape pillage worshiping false idols that sort of thing
4381710 sounds like the old testament did god turn everyone into pillars of salt
4381711 not exactly but he warned this shepard he said that he was going to punish all these people for their sins and this shepard brought this message to everyone and they shaped up
4381712 what if god was at one point trying to tell us how we were fucking up and we just stopped listening what if god isnt talking to us anymore
4381713 shut the fuck up dont pass any fucking judgments on me
4381714 no im just saying that maybe if god still cared about us youd believe in him like yknow it would have shown itself to you in some way spoken to you somehow
4381715 well i do if god doesnt care about us then whats the point of living
4381716 just i dont fucking know just be the best person you can i guess help others or something

4381724 yeah its not like back home in boston where everyone is rude

4381740 he knows it doesnt matter how small i am hes not going to overlook the size of my heart and what i try to do to win
4381741 will no doubt one day get a chance to play in pro hockey
4381742 hes been invited here because he had a very good season
4381743 itll be a good challenge to see how he fits among the top guys in the country
4381744 its always tough playing against the best you have to be prepared every day
4381745 luke has very good skills now and the expectations are that he will build them with another year or two of development he is going to get stronger and he is going to get more proficient on the scoring side we need his size and physical play
4381746 ryane clowe is a great role model for me and he is definitely someone that i look up to for inspiration
4381747 ryane was always nagged about his skating and people said that he was too big and he wasnt going to make the nhl but look where he is today in my opinion he is one of the best power forwards in the national hockey league i work out alongside of him during the summers and being able to push along with him is great training ryane is in the nhl so i know what its going to take to get there its great to have a role model like ryane clowe
4381748 clowe is a hard working guy and really contributes well to the sharks if luke sticks with his example and follows his pattern hes got the potential to be a long time nhler theres a lot of upside to lukes game if he follows ryane clowes lead it will be the work that gets him there and the amount of goals will keep him there
4381749 ryane clowe is a very good player i think that would be a real good deal for the buffalo sabres
4381750 tyler myers is going to be a very good defenseman
4381751 it was a guy that was moving his tailgating equipment and trying to take it all down he had a tv in his hands he was dragging a tent and a cooler and his girlfriend had all the chairs they are running back to their car to load it all up and then get into the game i thought if someone could take that off their hands and they are not in such a rush they would be able to enjoy their whole game day experience and enjoy tailgating it just takes a big load off their shoulders
4381752 no matter how big the party is we make it feel like you are actually tailgating because we only use 10 x 10 tents
4381753 no matter how big your group is it could be under one 10 x 10 tent or five of them
4381754 in january the online sheet was filled out but apparently it was posted incorrectly the unintentional violation of the deadline annoyed me deeply it was a blunder of mine from which i will certainly learn dealing with the reporting requirement is still quite new for us but this may no excuse for my mistake
4381755 would you like to go to the country side this weekend
4381756 little pig little pig ill blow your head off and ill take out your piglets cause theyll be better off

4381758 even if tzipora livni makes the decisions this doesnt mean that she is fit to do so

4381760 brought upon israel the repercussions of the disengagement the second lebanon war and a series of embarrassing affairs
4381761 defense minister and labor leader ehud barak is a hysterical person on the verge of collapse
4381762 it is obvious that at the helm of a party on the threshold of bankruptcy there is an hysterical man whose conduct in the past few days only reinforces our conviction that barak understands kadima is a strong party
4381763 is losing his temper and restraint and showing signs of distress
4381764 because your boyfriend will be there and you just want to go and see him
4381765 well if you think that you can go with me and see for yourself
4381766 what would you think if an old guy like me got up there and took a shot
4381767 the newspaper is of necessity something of a monopoly and its first duty is to shun the temptations of monopoly
4381768 nothing in the world can take the place of persistence
4381769 this isnt a job this is play and i get paid for it i get to go to events other people had to buy tickets for
4381770 its the movies we watch that kind of language is in all the movies we like to go to
4381771 its hard enough to contain a species once it makes its way into nonnative waters
4381772 when each mud snail has the ability to produce large quantities of embryos without a partner youve really got a problem
4381773 where theyve gotten into streams in the western part of the country theyve caused a lot of problems
4381774 theyre taking over space that should have other native species living in it
4381775 i could sum it up in one word nothing the permit doesnt change a thing
4381776 ive only got like two rows to go em i need to see this movie i asked and the guy told me they had it in the delete bins its not my stupid fault they dont organise these things
4381777 well what does the cover look like i cant even remember what were looking for thats how long weve been here mitch please
4381778 its called down with woodstock and its got a picture of a tough asian girl with a fat lip and her arms crossed its supposed to be like this intense psychological revenge story ive heard amazing things about the actress shes from vancouver
4381779 and for your information shes second generation laotian and half irish but since gay marriage is acceptable i will take her as my bride i will not accept any slander of paige sue namoon she is an impish freckled prodigy dont you think wed be a cute couple
4381780 we are going to my place right now to watch this afterwards you can tell me about your new irish boy and ill talk about how effing cute paige sue no doubt is in down with woodstock
4381781 i know about what happened with you and sean dont call me
4381782 yo no paraba de decir esto es demasiado extra o
4381783 claro d jame recordarte eres mi mejor amigo l es mi marido esto es un poco extra o
4381784 no me hab a planteado c mo funcionar a mi qu mica con l desde
4381785 the skies still cry to the tune of moreys guitar
4381786 cripes emily did you eat a live wookie or something your insides are making chewbacca noises
4381787 oh thanks my grandmother in ireland knit it for me its striped like the irish flag i guess my years spent in boarding school there didnt make me aware enough of my heritage for her liking your scarf is pretty nice too
4381788 thanks its also hand knit but my friend aja made it for me
4381789 oh apologies so now that i know your friends name can i get yours
4381790 its the only number ive got in toronto or else id write those other ones down too i know how creepy it must seem to meet someone on the subway but the ball is in your court so to speak no pressure or anything i would just like to get to know you better
4381791 its very important to keep those standards going as we move forward
4381792 our backs had been against the wall before that test in auckland and we just had to win and you know to be fair i think we are in the same position here
4381793 the tri nations is up for grabs and we have to win the game so it is about getting the motivation and desire we had for the auckland test for this game now
4381794 its going to be another huge challenge for us and i believe we need to improve on our game from auckland if we are to come out of here with the desired result
4381795 it was a good display but the springboks will present us with an entirely different challenge again
4381796 they will provide us with different opportunities and different circumstances than the wallabies did so we always need to be evolving our game
4381797 the springboks are a side who like to cut down your time and space with the ball so we need to look at a way of adjusting our game to counter that
4381798 it will be a totally different style of game so you cant really judge it too much on our last outing
4381799 the test in dunedin proved that this weekend is going to be a massive challenge for us anyone who can come there and win is a decent team in my books
4381800 obviously we want to win more because the tri nations is on the line for us rather than going out there just to beat them for the dunedin test
4381801 we really want to keep the tri nations alive and to do that we have to win no excuses
4381802 yeah its a week off from rugby but we are still training hard
4381803 it does help though coming off two really tough test matches against the wallabies it is good just to get a bit of a break and re focus towards this game
4381804 we will be looking for more of the same as in wellington really
4381805 we need to look to dominate them up front and if we can do that our game will flow from there it will enable the backs to have a little more time on the ball which is going to be crucial if we are to get the win
4381806 and there is no getting away from the fact we have to be ultra clinical as the springboks are not going to present us with too many chances at home
4381807 if we can take our chances and keep an advantage in the forwards then we have a real shot at winning this one
4381808 obs deutschland im plus stiftung f r private berschuldungspr vention
4381809 but we have so much catching up to do its been over six years since we really talked to each other
4381810 uh weve actually probably never really had a conversation i dont see why we should start now
4381811 em are you saying this needs to be a one night stand
4381812 this was a mistake im sorry i was feeling really awful about myself and you started talking to me in has bean and you obviously didnt recognise me and i just needed to know that im better now than i used to be i went about it the wrong way i know but nobody understands how i can be so insecure about something so stupid and im sorry sean i need to go
4381813 can you stay to at least talk about this i have an iron you can save yourself the trip home
4381814 no i need to mull things over but thanks for a few seconds there i actually forgot about her
4381815 him him mal my boyfriend i think well he used to be
4381816 las prostitutas extranjeras han empezado a atacar chicas de la universidad de pek n partido comunista y ciudadanos chinos vuestro mayor reto ha llegado
4381817 hombres de sangre roja de china a la carga denle un abrazo a esta chica
4381818 hermanos si no atacamos ahora cu ndo lo vamos a hacer
4381819 probablemente sea un gesto amistoso deber amos expresar nuestra bienvenida a los amigos extranjeros durante el abrazo
4381820 isnt she just perfect shes so strong and fucked up and her accent is so cute
4381821 it sounds like le fortress or it could be shit what was the name of morey leforts original band it was something totally stupid
4381822 i think they were called rhinocratic oath but he was also in wicketkeeper
4381823 so i watched down with woodstock the agreement was that i could tell you about malachi
4381824 and you know that i would have listened to your boy gossip even if you hadnt seen the movie i just wanted you to know who the bride is when i send out wedding announcements
4381825 i can see why youre getting the lesbian vibe i get it too thats how i know shes straight you know how bad i am with this kind of thing remember roland i had absolutely no idea he was gay and i could have sworn that anthony from high school was closeted until you um proved me wrong
4381826 thats true youre really bad when it comes to that
4381827 mal i dunno he dressed well he spoke highly of his grandmother i guess but he certainly started flirting with me so im going to say that hes straight
4381828 well now youve jinxed it hes out doing unmentionable things to his hipster boyfriend as we speak
4381829 you should totally call him and interrupt that love fest
4381830 you know i only met him for three minutes right i know nothing about him other than hes irish he smells good and has the greenest damn eyes i think ive ever seen oh and i met him on the subway
4381831 thats a shame all good romances need to start on eastbound trains thats why so many songs are written about them
4381832 yeah he was skinny and had floppy hair and hadnt shaved that morning im thinking either a musician or a student
4381833 then yeah you should call him there needs to be a good love song about a northbound train
4381834 lamest justification ever mitch now if youll excuse me i have a boy with a very sexy accent to call
4381835 if you dont want to see foghorn choir again you shouldnt have to i mean theyre not your scene right you told me you didnt really like the venue and that they were really boring
4381836 i know but aja already bought tickets and maybe fcll be better this time aja says theyve gotten a lot of buzz lately plus theyre the opening band i dont know if well stay for the rest but the other groups could be good its just bad timing mostly i hate having to cancel plans with you i see you so often and i still cant get enough
4381837 aww i just dont like that youre changing our three month anniversary plans two days in advance what if i had something really cool planned
4381838 er no not really i was going to take you to dinner at a nicer than usual place though and maybe bowling
4381839 thats fine when do i get to meet aja anyway
4381840 soon i guess she wants to meet you too she says she wants to know if i talk about her when im with you i told her that i talk about her just as much as i talk about you you could come to the show with us on friday
4381841 theres no effing way that stupid foghorn choir sold every ticket
4381842 sure i guess its not like i have anything better to do that night anymore
4381843 you really talk about me as much as you do about aja
4381844 of course its either you or complaining about how much i hate my job and wish i was in school like the two of you are mentioning how great my relationship is going is much less negative than anything else ive got going on

4381849 we get from time to time people saying youre biased in favour of the labour party every time i ask people show me a case of that bias explain to me where we got it wrong and why what we said was so unfair they seem to be unable to do so
4381850 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias
4381851 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground

4381866 if this type of response rate can be replicated at these durations it could be a very effective therapy
4381867 we get from time to time people saying youre biased in favour of the labour party every time i ask people show me a case of that bias explain to me where we got it wrong and why what we said was so unfair they seem to be unable to do so
4381868 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias
4381869 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground
4381870 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil

4381941 people enjoy more freedom people are living a good life everyone is happy thats a fact of course there are exceptions like in any other country but they need to take the legal process and procedures to resolve any issues we cannot allow this country to be in chaos

4381945 the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people
4381946 poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4381947 above all it seems that the americans changed their opinion as a result of the situation in the caucasus
4381948 it sends a signal to moscow that people are not going to be intimidated
4381949 it is this kind of agreement not the differences between the us and russia over south ossetia which could lead to a real rise in the tension in russian american relations
4381950 the threats from russia create unease i take them very seriously
4381951 reiterates with the greatest firmness its condemnation of the coup that took place in mauritania
4381952 the cessation of hostilities announced by moscow has not yet reflected particularly into any improvement in terms of access for humanitarian aid workers
4381953 we appeal to all sides when we address humanitarian issues
4381954 the secretary general is extremely concerned by the impact of the recent conflict on the civilian population in georgia which has suffered loss of life and injury significant damage to civilian property and infrastructure as well as sizeable displacement
4381955 the critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4381956 the authorities in principle are ready to give us access but we are being told that there are ongoing security concerns
4381957 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4381958 reiterates with the greatest firmness its condemnation of the coup that took place in mauritania
4381959 ooh a previous winners solo project thats good for at least two column inches

4381967 on the day of the ceremony there were actual footprint fireworks from the south to the north of the city
4381968 however because of the poor visibility some of the previously recorded footage may have been used
4381969 youre looking at a cinematic device employed by zhang yimou here this is actually almost animation a footstep a second 29 in all to signify the 29 olympiads
4381970 we said earlier that aspects of this opening ceremony are almost like cinema in real time well this is quite literally cinematic
4381971 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared with the actual fireworks
4381972 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished
4381973 we have a perfect voice and a perfect image and representation
4381974 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country

4381976 i take my two sons to nearly every home game at the emirates my lads like to fit in with the rest of their friends who watch arsenal and that means they like to have the latest shirts but it is becoming very difficult to furnish them with the shirts every year so we normally buy them for christmas or birthdays but i cant help looking back and thinking that these shirts have a shelf life of a year and that we are wasting our money now
4381977 this year i have said enough is enough instead of paying out on the latest kit ive bought a retro shirt which will give me more years than the latest updates on the home shirt

4381984 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4381985 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4381986 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4381987 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4381988 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4381990 the main push has been a firmer us dollar across the board as well as weaker commodities
4381991 the us is not out of the woods but seems to be improving compared to the rest of the world
4381992 thats why the sentiment towards the us dollar has changed
4381993 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a trade off strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background

4382027 in this difficult situation we must refrain from blaming attacking and discrediting each other for the sake of momentary political gains
4382028 frankly speaking the year 2008 is a difficult period and wrought with challenges the price of oil has reached the highest level in history the price of food all over the world has drastically soared the world economy is threatened by a recession

4382037 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
4382038 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
4382039 we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4382041 we believe were one of the top three or four alternative search engines in the marketplace
4382042 youre going to see more and more search engines become part of other applications so we think that this application will be particularly well suited for when youre looking for people or companies or entities of any nature
4382043 the reason why people wanted to develop semantic web search engines is because its a more real way of finding stuff
4382044 keeping in mind that the content is growing faster search engines need to be more effective at reflecting the thinking of real people
4382045 some people think that the behaviour of how people express their information needs has been established by google so even though they dont express it in natural language they do use just a couple of words

4382047 the fujifilm finepix s100fs is a true alternative to a dslr camera fitted with a super zoom lens though hardly a compact camera it sports a relatively compact and fast wide angle to super telephoto 14 3x zoom lens of very high quality the relatively large 11 million pixel super ccd imaging sensor delivers great quality pictures even in less than ideal lighting conditions and the tiltable lcd allows more interesting angles of view as a serious travel camera it has few rivals and the price makes it affordable for any enthusiast
4382048 sales of the finepix s100fs have exceeded our expectations this is the first year that eisa has had a best superzoom category which just goes to show that demand for bridge cameras is increasing fujifilm is extremely proud of the finepix s100fs and winning a prestigious eisa award is a great honour for a photographic manufacturer to receive the finepix s100fs won a tipa award earlier this year and to win the eisa award as well proves that it is the best in its class

4382055 clearly spain has become a tremendously important market for formula 1 over the past five years and the addition of a second spanish race to the calendar rightly reflects the sports success and popularity in the market
4382056 we launched the vodafone mclaren mercedes partnership here in 2007 and the city was a stunning backdrop to the event
4382057 everything weve seen about the city and the organisation of this event leads me to believe it will be a fantastic success and set a new standard for formula 1 more importantly it marks a return to city racing something we will also witness in singapore and next year in abu dhabi and thats something that really engages the people and fans far more than at a purpose built circuit out of town this is an important time for the growth of the sport and everybody at vodafone mclaren mercedes will be hoping the weekend is a fantastic success both for the team itself and the sport as a whole

4382064 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long

4382068 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4382069 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4382070 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything

4382143 the problem we have faced in the past is producing enough of these coiled carbon nanotubes at a reasonable cost to make a difference
4382144 because our current method produces coiled nanotubes quickly in high yield it can be readily scaled up to industrial levels after formation the coiled nanotubes can be peeled off in one piece and placed on other surfaces to form instant cushioning coatings
4382145 if you move your hand backward as you catch the egg and increase the time of contact over which the impact occurs the impact will be less forceful and the egg will not break it is the same phenomenon experienced in catching a baseball
4382146 manganese is an element found naturally in the body in addition the manganese in the nanobialys is tied up so it stays with the particles making them very safe
4382147 when we looked at the particles with an electron microscope we saw they are round and flat with a dimple in the centre like red blood cells but also a little irregular like bagels
4382148 i came across the word bialy which is a polish roll like a bagel without a hole that can be made with different toppings so i called the particles nanobialys
4382149 even though it seems that gadolinium affects only those with severe renal failure physicians have decided not to use gadolinium even in those with moderate renal failure
4382150 a lot of patients with diabetes or hypertension develop renal failure so that decision potentially affects many people our goal has always been that our nanoparticle technology should be able to help everyone and with a growing number of people having diabetes and related cardiovascular problems we knew we needed to find a substitute for gadolinium based particles nanobialys are our first step in that direction
4382151 as nanotechnology scientists we face a challenge similar to the one faced by structural biologists half a century ago determining the structure with atomic scale precision of a whole range of nanoscale materials
4382152 if we can understand how peptides self assemble at the surface of a nanoparticle we can open up a route towards the design and synthesis of nanoparticles that have complex surfaces these particles could find applications in the biomedical sciences for example to deliver drugs to a particular target in the body or to design sensitive diagnostic tests in the longer term these particles could also find applications in new generations of electronic components
4382153 it is possible that nanoparticles of precious metals are suitable candidates for catalysts in important reactions in the chemical industry
4382154 seven uncharged gold atoms form a triangle with an additional vertex
4382155 uncharged gold atoms probably prefer this structure as it is easier for the electrons to avoid each other
4382156 the clusters are rather unstable you cant just buy them as a powder
4382157 this means we have to repeat the experiment with around 200 different wavelengths of the infrared laser

4382159 the more you smoke the more likely you are to have a stroke
4382160 certainly quitting is the best thing you could do but cutting back does offer some benefit
4382161 our study adds strong evidence that cutting down helps reduce stroke risk but quitting is unquestionably the best option
4382162 what are you a moron the piranhas in there are friggin the ferocious can die
4382163 young people are like the energizer battery they never say die i mean they dont know how to spell the word die
4382164 young people nowadays dont know what is appreciation they have no qualms leaving their company which has taught them everything from a to z and made them the knowledgeable person that they are today
4382165 ahem well some companies dont know how to appreciate their staff thats why people leave
4382166 aiyo cannot say like that one did the company not pay you your monthly salary to feed you your dog your parents your spouse and your hungry children if you have any at home
4382167 of course you do but the opportunity to grow professionally career advancement and exposure are also very important factors to a baby calf like me or else how can i transform from a whiny little cow into a fucking loud bull
4382168 thats why i said young people like you are unappreciative only talk about money and money only
4382169 what to do my religion is mom baptized me in ungai wang since the day i was born
4382170 wait till you are old like me youll feel the pinch especially when age is catching up and you have godzillions tiny little mouths to feed leaving the comfort zone is equivalent to asking myself to be thrown into the piranha infested waters and attending interviews is like sending myself into the lions lair
4382171 true one hear the word interview the legs already start to shake violently like the leaves
4382172 antique like me has been staying in the top position for waaaay too long and am forever the one interviewing others and no chance to be interviewed back so when the roles are reversed you say i sweat like a pig or not leh
4382173 yeah i get what you mean but no pain no gain my friend would you choose to stay in a position where you dont get to learn much low stress good pay or one that you can get to learn a lot high stress very good pay
4382174 if im still young single and have no family obligations then ill opt for a good pay learn a lot job knowledge is power but once you get married your priorities will change youll prefer something more stable and routine something which gives you less headache put food on the table allow you more family time and pay you well enough and beyond until the day you retire
4382175 there you go you have said it yourself if you are young and have no family obligations youll give it a shot too
4382176 now dont you stop me for wanting to play in the piranha infested waters
4382177 however robert dudley remains chief executive pending completion of the appeal process

4382180 they will discuss issues related to structure management including personnel changes and the ipo
4382181 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4382182 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4382183 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4382184 i just want to find out whether he can get better at his age
4382185 we are seeing things unfold at the moment you are seeing olympians at 30 plus years of age winning goals medals im not sure why our game is any different
4382186 i want to talk to him about whether he thinks he can get better from here on end
4382187 james hird won a best and fairest at 34 and i think shane crawford and matthew richardson and these sorts of guys are having great seasons at their age and they are two or three years older than him

4382192 eliminate many of the inconsistencies that existed in the system over the first three years of the a league
4382193 the regulations were reviewed because we wanted to ensure that footballs disciplinary provisions are not only consistent with those of the sport internationally but also with community expectations within australia
4382194 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4382195 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4382196 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4382197 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4382198 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4382199 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4382200 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4382201 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4382202 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry

4382213 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4382214 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4382215 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4382216 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4382217 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4382218 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4382219 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4382220 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4382221 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4382222 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4382223 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4382224 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4382225 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4382226 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4382227 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4382228 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4382229 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4382230 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4382231 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4382232 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4382233 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4382234 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4382235 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4382236 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4382237 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4382238 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4382239 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4382240 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4382241 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4382242 in which our industry and our business have been under considerable downward pressure
4382243 continue to be negatively impacted by high inventory levels foreclosures a challenging financing environment at the higher home price levels and other market pressures the uncertainty about price declines seems to be driving the headlines and that has definitely had an affect on consumer confidence as well
4382244 clearly the timing of a housing recovery remains the greatest variable and challenge facing the industry today
4382245 most of this unit sale increase is from increased foreclosed home sales activity
4382246 the hamptons is also showing weakness although the rental market over the summer remains buoyant
4382247 which both performed fairly well for most of 2008 but in the last two months have weakened considerably
4382248 we believe higher commission rates are a function of lower average sales price and to the extent that average price continues to fall we would expect the average broker commission rate to remain steady or slightly improve
4382249 identify and assist brokers who have been adversely affected by the housing downturn
4382250 we believe there are very early signs of a developing bottom the issue of course is exactly when we do think it is sooner rather than later but of course we cant know for certain
4382251 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4382252 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4382253 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4382254 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4382255 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4382256 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4382257 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4382258 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4382259 i didnt know i had as little time as i did i didnt even have time to go into the ready room
4382260 i went from the ceremony straight into putting my parka on and goggles cap and go it was about two minutes
4382261 it just kind of flowed it just happened it felt great i just kept it strong and powered to the end
4382262 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4382263 it becomes very unimportant for me to comment on these reports i have been hearing all this for the past many months
4382264 musharraf will neither face impeachment nor be prosecuted we expect a major development in the next 48 hours
4382265 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4382266 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4382267 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4382268 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4382269 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4382270 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4382271 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4382272 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4382273 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4382274 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4382275 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4382276 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4382277 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4382278 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4382279 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4382280 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4382281 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4382282 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4382283 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4382284 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4382285 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4382286 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4382287 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4382288 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4382289 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4382290 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4382291 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4382292 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4382293 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4382294 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4382295 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4382296 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4382297 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4382298 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4382299 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4382300 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4382301 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4382302 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4382303 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4382304 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4382305 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4382306 who are open to doing something on the production side
4382307 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4382308 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4382309 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

4382320 here i express on behalf of the nation deep remorse and humble condolences for all of the people who fell victim
4382321 face up to history and refrain from making the foolish mistake of repeating the unfortunate past again today
4382322 i prayed for the souls of those who offered their lives for the country to rest in peace
4382323 its nonsense that neither prime minister fukuda nor the emperor are paying homage
4382324 i have my doubts about a shrine honouring the military

4382331 the film is both a bittersweet love story and a memorial to the tsunami victims
4382332 where on the screen i am invariably a sonofabitch in life i am a dear dear boy
4382333 for me it was like how do i manipulate this kid so he can do this and hes comfortable which is all part of directing
4382334 how can one be a maverick independent filmmaker and be an attentive loving husband and father
4382335 it is the subjective fever dream of a psyche carving fantasy out of reality as he goes
4382336 theres a whole postmodern hall of mirrors you can wander through with the idea of a digitally re colored final cut of a 10 year old directors cut of a 26 year old movie
4382337 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier

4382341 spore was very much inspired by many different types of sciences
4382342 we spent a lot of time meeting a lot of scientists very early on in developing this game to find out what areas would be interesting to bring into the game
4382343 were using spore as a nexus for explaining these theories on evolutionary biology
4382344 millions of people contribute content like planets buildings and creatures to your game but its not real time
4382345 youre seeing copies of peoples stuff so you can go up and blow up a planet and you havent ruined their experience
4382346 were exploring using these databases to populate other games where we might have all of the vehicles from the vehicle editor used in a different game under the spore umbrella thats a very different experience than spore

4382353 gee thats a good offer and all but i checked with a few dealers that told me this was what the car was really worth
4382354 its at the point now where some stars might decide to have more kids just to collect the money from their photos
4382355 its outrageous theyve gotten very sophisticated the rights are bought up now even before the celeb enters the hospital they hire extra security so its impossible to obtain a photo illegally
4382356 in reality this project has no relation to the iranian missile threat but is aimed against
4382357 we have finally got an understanding of our point of view that poland being a crucial partner in nato and an important friend and ally of the united states must also be safe
4382358 while im not going to comment about those specific allegations its my view that anyone who is illegally involved in diverting water in the murray darling system during this crisis is engaging in an act of terrorism against the people of australia
4382359 it is a criminal offence and anyone siphoning water off illegally in my view should be locked up rather than the fines that i am told are currently in place
4382360 anyone who is doing this sort of thing is unbelievably treacherous to the national interest and its an act of terrorism against the australian people
4382361 we are watching and we see the clips and so on but were focusing on the teams performances and in assisting our athletes
4382362 sper s joc la gala i sunt preg tit fizic
4382363 i dont blame you hiring a coach etc therapist copywriter trainer consultant can be a big decision can you share with me what specific aspect of my services you are concerned about
4382364 yes i can see how this can be a big decision you know i found that typically my clients are initially concerned with one of the three things is the problem important enough to solve it now is this the right solution for your situation can you afford the solution which one of those concerns you the most
4382365 hmmm i see let me ask you lets say we get started on this project what are the downsides
4382366 great what kinds of questions do you think they might they ask
4382367 good idea i always discuss decisions like this with my partner or spouse but let me ask you a question what will you do when your partner doesnt like the idea of us moving forward with this
4382368 yes its a solid investment i tell you what i know this is only worthwhile if you produce solid results right whats the one result you would want to be absolutely sure we could produce in the next month months six days 90 that would have you really happy you hired me great why dont we make this our top priority and get started right away
4382369 not really how does this price compare to what its costing you to do nothing about this problem
4382370 hmmmm how long have you been dealing with this issue if you havent solved it on your own so far what makes you think you can do it now
4382371 yes i suppose you could but let me ask you something when was the last time you saw heard of a heart surgeon performing an open heart surgery on himself
4382372 with all the respect i must disagree if you thought you could solve this problem on your own we wouldnt be talking right now tell me how would things be different if you could rely on an unbiased opinion to give you a fresh perspective of this problem
4382373 yes it will take some time to address this issue how much more time per week could you devote to other revenue generating activities if you could eliminate dealing with this problem on ongoing bases
4382374 thats funny you just told me it takes you 10 hours a week to deal with this problem wouldnt it make sense to hire someone like myself and solve it so that you can use your time on more productive tasks
4382375 wow if you are that busy and you are still not getting the results you want perhaps it would make sense to start the project by helping you better prioritize your activities and leverage your time more effectively
4382376 sometimes i catch myself thinking and wondering just how it is that i ended up being the coach of the russian national team and being a part of that tradition russia is no longer the u s s r and im no longer that 13 year old boy things happen but they happen for a reason
4382377 the amazing thing ive found and its good that it is that way is that basketball is basketball
4382378 the great equalizer is the game itself the places and the political circumstances and the faces may change but the game it advances but its basically the same its probably what naismith had in mind when he created it
4382379 were all recreating bits and pieces of things weve learned along the way
4382380 i dont have any particular burning desire to work in the nba
4382381 if a situation presented itself that was satisfying and fulfilling to me on a professional level then id certainly consider it
4382382 so far no ones knocked my door down and they certainly dont have to but if you look around europe im probably one of the easiest guys to cross over because i have the background and the high level euro experience

4382398 en los ltimos dos o tres a os se registra la aparici n de un grupo de unas diez droguer as marginales cuyos nombres se reiteran en estas investigaciones
4382399 hay unas 400 causas en relaci n con la comercializaci n irregular de medicamentos muchos de ellos han sido robados a programas nacionales en especial el de sida a las droguer as adem s de la denuncia penal se les inicia un sumario administrativo por el cual hasta hace poco se les aplicaban multas irrisorias de mil o dos mil pesos hace unos meses empezamos a darles de baja

4382422 the us is still cheap its still a good holiday but its got a lot more expensive
4382423 get the notion of counting things out of your system
4382424 the more we learn about anything the more we have to tune the vocabulary we use to describe it
4382425 how many scientists get to have their business in the op ed pages in comic strips
4382426 its that debate that exposure of issues to people thats more important
4382427 this is helping to expose a little bit more of the messy side of science this clash of ideas and its a good positive thing
4382428 the time has come to discard the useless words and reinvent an entire system to respect the level of science we have achieved
4382429 were interested in which objects exhibit similar characteristics so that when we send spacecraft out into the solar system we can understand these things better
4382430 we had a good summer and most of the team was there four days a week in open gyms and summer league play
4382431 we have a young group who really enjoy playing the game
4382432 we only have three kids on the team who play other sports

4382437 officials from the state general administration of sports once told us if liu could not win a gold in beijing all of his previous achievements would become meaningless
4382438 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4382439 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4382440 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4382441 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4382442 if you want to know the truth i think its a good test for our team
4382443 if you stay in the hunt and you battle it out and we win i think that tells us what kind of team we are theres two ways to look at it if we get down and we dont come back were not champions and were not men
4382444 sometimes i catch myself thinking and wondering just how it is that i ended up being the coach of the russian national team and being a part of that tradition russia is no longer the u s s r and im no longer that 13 year old boy things happen but they happen for a reason

4382448 i dont have any particular burning desire to work in the nba
4382449 if a situation presented itself that was satisfying and fulfilling to me on a professional level then id certainly consider it
4382450 so far no ones knocked my door down and they certainly dont have to but if you look around europe im probably one of the easiest guys to cross over because i have the background and the high level euro experience
4382451 getting these guys is equal to making a big trade like milwaukee getting cc sabathia
4382452 if they johnson and sanchez pitch like 2006 well be in the hunt until the final out
4382453 i have seen the best racing of the season since they made the change
4382454 i think a lot of competitors like the shorter distance because the blowups arent as extreme and were not tearing up our cars and the fans are seeing tighter racing to the 1 000 foot mark
4382455 but the nhra had to make a decision and i believe its still racing at its best
4382456 i get out of the car now and ask my team if my time was good
4382457 were just lifting off the throttle a little sooner its only an instant and because the cars traveling so fast the missing 320 feet are like nothing the change is all in the name of safety and we support it
4382458 if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4382459 its just hard coming off the individual competition you fence so hard and you only have so many days later
4382460 if you want to know the truth i think its a good test for our team
4382461 if you stay in the hunt and you battle it out and we win i think that tells us what kind of team we are theres two ways to look at it if we get down and we dont come back were not champions and were not men
4382462 do they come to the games that wasnt the aspect i was talking about
4382463 they always say theyre passionate to a fault thats not the aspect i was talking about
4382464 then theyre on his side after he comes through and gets some big hits
4382465 you should be there from day one because hes going to need your energy the same way when im out there i need it to keep going
4382466 it just kind of bounces down through the team person to person to person
4382467 thats tough to go up there one its already hard enough to hit and play ball then youre like man these people dont even want me out there thats the aspect i was talking about
4382468 take the team that you have and push them to do better
4382469 dont take black friday and put that on these new guys some of them dont even know you know about the history of the team dont get me wrong but your job when youre there youre trying to change that for that time period my tenure here were we successful and thats all i can control
4382470 they feel sometimes that by getting on you they can help change the outcome
4382471 negative energy doesnt produce anything positive thats just the truth its not me its booing the guy thats out there working hard busting his butt thats when i really get upset
4382472 a lot of times fans worldwide this is in general they say youre making all this money youre supposed to take it
4382473 i paid to come to the game so i can let you know anything and say anything i want to before i was a ballplayer i was a person and still am a person the same way you are so if you say something as a person forget the uniform as a person i can say something back
4382474 its going to come down to the kind of shape were in
4382475 officials from the state general administration of sports once told us if liu could not win a gold in beijing all of his previous achievements would become meaningless
4382476 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4382477 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4382478 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4382479 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4382480 but we knew it was just a matter of time before we got it done
4382481 i love being part of this organization and the direction that the team is heading
4382482 he is a very energetic coach who brings a lot of enthusiasm and passion to the game and we look forward to working together over the next few years
4382483 i want to fill your world with beauty as far as i can see whisper beautiful things in your ear and telling you how much you mean to me
4382484 remarkable demonstration of the use of theatre as an instrument of protest
4382485 i really related to it because i had an abortion when i was eighteen
4382486 at that time it was damn near impossible to find someone who would perform one
4382487 the airport was full of standees of famous movie stars and i remember thinking they had probably all been there for the same reason i was
4382488 it was the best sale weve ever had on a friday in a summer
4382489 all of a sudden the guy who manages the site said were getting a ridiculous amount of views
4382490 we had about 7 000 plus views in the couple days it was up its pretty cool to have something so random come in and give us some spotlight that i think we deserve
4382491 you can go to almost any city in america and find a festival
4382492 i dont mean to be arrogant about it or anything but you cant find this kind of uniqueness anywhere else its a secret someone found it
4382493 the lead caucasian male age late 20s to late 30s government agent cia type 59
4382494 the secondary caucasian latin or bi racial male age late 20s to late 30s also government agent cia type 58
4382495 i serve the people of the united states as a soldier of 20 years in the united states army having large dogs myself i feel the pain mr and mrs calvo must be going through i would like to donate money to them to help defray the cost of replacing their pets or if they prefer to use it to sue the pg county sheriffs office personally i feel that replacing the dogs would help start the healing process whereas the lawsuit wont bring dead dogs to life
4382496 the democrats in their zeal to raise taxes on cigarettes have driven lord knows how much commerce across the boarder
4382497 the tax increases are going to hurt us in ways we havent even contemplated yet were just starting to see ways we knew they would have an impact
4382498 we do have some pretty loyal customers but if someone is going across the bridge to get cigarettes they may say while im here ill get gas
4382499 i think the subgroup that has the greatest challenges based on our results are in special education they are followed by english language learners
4382500 they arent going to say dump all the teachers change the school leadership
4382501 we still have work to do at some of our schools particularly at the middle school level but i am pleased that the large majority of our schools are doing what it takes to meet standards which rise every year
4382502 it really is a cumulation of the msa results that we got weeks ago
4382503 there are forces in place with curriculum department to deal with the schools
4382504 this system has rallied around these schools and has put the measures in place to help them succeed next year
4382505 all of these schools have successfully met our local standard of having 70 percent or more of their students scoring at proficient or above in both reading and mathematics
4382506 i have never been a believer in chiropractic for horses never
4382507 i am now i was throwing darts i couldnt leave any stone unturned i had to do everything and anything basically the only thing i wasnt doing was calling the horse psychic
4382508 its a scary thing when youve got a horse named snow white that youre doing it to
4382509 if it was a 20 claimer 50 claimer even 100 claimer you wouldnt think so much about it
4382510 she loves it absolutely enjoys it anything you have to do to her shell let you she knows youre trying to help her
4382511 for me to be a player in that race ive got to go under 50 seconds in the qualifying last night i was a full body length behind after the first 50 meters ive got to go out there and push the pace for the first 50
4382512 the schedule that michael has been keeping is just unbelievable
4382513 we havent gotten to this point on the back of any one player
4382514 some of these roles have been new to these guys and when you start putting guys in different roles it takes guys a while to react to that
4382515 i think our fans expect us to play good they come to the game wanting us to win and why shouldnt they thats why they come to the game they pull for us to win and when we lose and things like that and were not doing good more than likely in philadelphia theyre going to boo you but they do that everywhere else too
4382516 just to have a look at him that is my dream
4382517 i just want to see him one time its ok
4382518 we were going into the stadium at the opening ceremonies and the crowd was chanting kobe
4382519 he was to the left of me a little ways and i told one of our coaches
4382520 i thought i was famous until i got here with kobe
4382521 i think if i put on a sixer jersey it would be a little different story
4382522 to see the reaction i get out here it feels good it would be nice for them to see probably
4382523 i dont know his american name it translates to ko be
4382524 i was running around here yesterday and i was telling my friends i dont know when the hell this happened
4382525 last year we came out here we come out here every summer to do clinics and stuff like that ive always been popular but i dont know when this happened
4382526 it was just pouring down rain there were like 100 kids just waiting just chasing the bus in the rain everybody on the bus was just laughing theyre dedicated
4382527 when we sustain drives and move the ball down the field we have to come out with touchdowns
4382528 i mean any time a team gets down there we pride ourselves by not giving up touchdowns i just happened to be the guy this time to be able to step up and make a big hit
4382529 we havent gotten to this point on the back of any one player
4382530 when we sustain drives and move the ball down the field we have to come out with touchdowns
4382531 i mean any time a team gets down there we pride ourselves by not giving up touchdowns i just happened to be the guy this time to be able to step up and make a big hit
4382532 getting these guys is equal to making a big trade like milwaukee getting cc sabathia
4382533 if they johnson and sanchez pitch like 2006 well be in the hunt until the final out
4382534 just to have a look at him that is my dream
4382535 i just want to see him one time its ok
4382536 we were going into the stadium at the opening ceremonies and the crowd was chanting kobe
4382537 he was to the left of me a little ways and i told one of our coaches
4382538 i thought i was famous until i got here with kobe
4382539 i think if i put on a sixer jersey it would be a little different story
4382540 to see the reaction i get out here it feels good it would be nice for them to see probably
4382541 i dont know his american name it translates to ko be
4382542 i was running around here yesterday and i was telling my friends i dont know when the hell this happened
4382543 last year we came out here we come out here every summer to do clinics and stuff like that ive always been popular but i dont know when this happened
4382544 it was just pouring down rain there were like 100 kids just waiting just chasing the bus in the rain everybody on the bus was just laughing theyre dedicated
4382545 cathay didnt hedge enough and fuel costs went up really quickly
4382546 as of now we have to go by the existing laws we cannot say there is a need to amend the abortion related laws going by one case
4382547 what happens with animals when their skin is ripped from their bodies when theyre still alive its heartbreaking for me
4382548 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4382549 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4382550 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4382551 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4382552 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4382553 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4382554 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw
4382555 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4382556 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4382557 if things arent in place by then it might take a few more days
4382558 every time you are stepping on the field you are looking to make plays
4382559 there are big changes for you but you will be happy
4382560 focus on your long term goal good things will soon happen
4382561 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4382562 its just that the guy i came to see here tonight is with another girl
4382563 no he isnt or else you wouldnt have come all the way here to see him
4382564 there will be other girls and other bars and other parties
4382565 i did not give you a spirit of hopelessness a spirit of fear or a spirit of defeat i did not teach you to give in this isnt of me shake this off for there is something that matters more
4382566 keep the game tight is what i wanted and the guys came through
4382567 do they come to the games that wasnt the aspect i was talking about
4382568 they always say theyre passionate to a fault thats not the aspect i was talking about
4382569 then theyre on his side after he comes through and gets some big hits
4382570 you should be there from day one because hes going to need your energy the same way when im out there i need it to keep going
4382571 it just kind of bounces down through the team person to person to person
4382572 thats tough to go up there one its already hard enough to hit and play ball then youre like man these people dont even want me out there thats the aspect i was talking about
4382573 take the team that you have and push them to do better
4382574 dont take black friday and put that on these new guys some of them dont even know you know about the history of the team dont get me wrong but your job when youre there youre trying to change that for that time period my tenure here were we successful and thats all i can control
4382575 they feel sometimes that by getting on you they can help change the outcome
4382576 negative energy doesnt produce anything positive thats just the truth its not me its booing the guy thats out there working hard busting his butt thats when i really get upset
4382577 a lot of times fans worldwide this is in general they say youre making all this money youre supposed to take it
4382578 i paid to come to the game so i can let you know anything and say anything i want to before i was a ballplayer i was a person and still am a person the same way you are so if you say something as a person forget the uniform as a person i can say something back
4382579 but we knew it was just a matter of time before we got it done
4382580 i love being part of this organization and the direction that the team is heading
4382581 he is a very energetic coach who brings a lot of enthusiasm and passion to the game and we look forward to working together over the next few years
4382582 i was told that the forward was diving for a violation call to win a corner kick it is a common tactic but i dont think the chinese forward played it wisely this blunder only revealed his or the teams lousiness
4382583 for me to be a player in that race ive got to go under 50 seconds in the qualifying last night i was a full body length behind after the first 50 meters ive got to go out there and push the pace for the first 50
4382584 the schedule that michael has been keeping is just unbelievable
4382585 i have seen the best racing of the season since they made the change
4382586 i think a lot of competitors like the shorter distance because the blowups arent as extreme and were not tearing up our cars and the fans are seeing tighter racing to the 1 000 foot mark
4382587 but the nhra had to make a decision and i believe its still racing at its best
4382588 i get out of the car now and ask my team if my time was good
4382589 were just lifting off the throttle a little sooner its only an instant and because the cars traveling so fast the missing 320 feet are like nothing the change is all in the name of safety and we support it
4382590 if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4382591 its just hard coming off the individual competition you fence so hard and you only have so many days later
4382592 coach marty mornhinweg and coach reid have a lot of things in the offense for me jackson said
4382593 they have a lot of confidence in me and are giving me an opportunity to help this team out i feel im better from the last game to this game coming off the ball running my routes
4382594 the volume got to him a little bit as we got toward the end of our installs in the spring minicamps thats understandable i wasnt shocked by it hes an intelligent kid and he wants to be good he has that drive well see how he continues here
4382595 its still long if i come back next year it will be shorter
4382596 he came in and showed me as billy crystal said in analyze that its a process he took a little bit off its within the rules of cleaning it up a little bit right now its around his shoulders its not covering his name up well continue to monitor it
4382597 he says every time he gets a hit its the hair i say its the ability he knows as well as everybody else around here that his ability is special hes a character
4382598 any time you have a preseason game you take the good and the bad
4382599 am i disappointed the way we played sure that series
4382600 its like youre trying to crank the car up a bit more every week
4382601 weve given up a couple long drives carolina didnt score this time pittsburgh was able to score on theirs so we just have to make sure we dont give up those long drives and get off the field bring it out and get some turnovers too
4382602 but i talked to my brother and he told me that i hadnt given it enough time hadnt given it a fair chance that 3 weeks wasnt long enough so i gave it a chance
4382603 i get an apartment on 43rd street in west philly
4382604 im going to be away on a 12 day road trip and i know that on tuesdays you have to move the car so they can sweep the street so i put it in a garage but i havent unpacked yet so there are golf clubs binoculars a record player other good stuff in the trunk
4382605 i come back after the trip and go to get the car and theres a lot of scurrying around i get in the car and im driving and the odometer has been disconnected there are cigarette butts in the ashtray theyve been driving the car the whole time i open the trunk and everythings gone
4382606 and i said i really might have to rethink this philly thing but i stayed
4382607 merchant told me we want to inform em we want to entertain em and every once in a while we want to surprise em thats what ive tried to do
4382608 you know that positive energy can lift you that negative energy can bring you down
4382609 ich werte das als weiteren beleg dass unsere strategischen auslandsaktivit ten erfolgreich sind
4382610 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought it was offensive
4382611 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
4382612 the problem with michael phelps is there is no competition where he is now if he came to where im from which is the inner city liberty city miami i was the three time charles hadley pool champ i know a couple of people that could be michael phelps right now and im one of them
4382613 i want to make sure that if and when we do it its really good its perfect
4382614 itll be very limited i want to make sure and im not quite certain yet but we should have answers very shortly
4382615 weve spent a lot of time doing a lot of wiring of ballparks doing a lot of checking
4382616 every game i watch theres a bat splintered im sensitive about it and we need to move ahead
4382617 if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4382618 i proved that i played with the best tonight and it couldnt have happened to me on a better stage
4382619 i missed some key shots that i probably shouldnt have missed
4382620 sejam cidad os chineses ou estrangeiros na china se querem realizar manifesta es prociss es ou demonstra es devem respeitar as leis chinesas e os regulamentos
4382621 in think in the first half that the defense played very solid football
4382622 you cant have that many drops and expect to move the ball consistently and we have to cut down on the penalties
4382623 for me it was about working on ball placement i just tried to get the ball in a position where they could come down with it and possibly pick up yards
4382624 severe conditions advising fans to take cover in the concourses
4382625 i wouldnt have been upset if they had called it its dangerous out here with lightning
4382626 as the manager of the team there were two fundamental responsibilities
4382627 one was to win the game and the second was just as important to get everyone home safely
4382628 there is no easy answer we knew the game was going to be played to its completion
4382629 he has a brand new pitch that he didnt have and its good
4382630 i think everyone in the bullpen was hurt its saying we cant do our jobs
4382631 i heard the red wings put in a claim on me
4382632 you see a happy vacation spot we can send people to
4382633 i dont so well have to do the best we can
4382634 we had a good summer and most of the team was there four days a week in open gyms and summer league play
4382635 we have a young group who really enjoy playing the game
4382636 we only have three kids on the team who play other sports
4382637 he knew i wanted to be a head coach and he taught me all the ins and outs

4382648 some of these roles have been new to these guys and when you start putting guys in different roles it takes guys a while to react to that
4382649 i think our fans expect us to play good they come to the game wanting us to win and why shouldnt they thats why they come to the game they pull for us to win and when we lose and things like that and were not doing good more than likely in philadelphia theyre going to boo you but they do that everywhere else too
4382650 hes the greatest sportsman ever to walk the planet said britains liam tancock who swam in lane 1
4382651 if he wasnt in the sport of swimming i dont think id be swimming as well lochte said
4382652 hes up there and i want to become better than him i cant say without him id be where i am
4382653 thats an unbelievable thing for him its a cool moment phelps said
4382654 to be a player in that race i have to force the first 50 meters if im there itll be a race
4382655 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can he explained
4382656 it was a best time but i think i was just disappointed that i know i can go faster than that

4382661 that is the feeling i have been looking for and it feels very good
4382662 but i respect them so much to be here in their own country i can only imagine the pressure they were under we had a little pressure on us going in as world champions but with their being at home and expected to win they worked hard for it we worked hard for it but it was their day
4382663 i know i had so many doubters the last few years with my injuries
4382664 she was rock solid she has her ability to do her best at the most important moment even in the big arena
4382665 i thought if i flopped something here my ace might be the best hand and i could make a big pot
4382666 maybe he thinks i have a draw maybe he thinks i have 3 5 and im looking for a deuce or maybe he thinks i have two big overcards
4382667 im thinking he could have a full house so i was going to play the hand cautiously
4382668 or maybe he was on a stone cold bluff figuring i didnt have a 6 or maybe i have two overcards
4382669 i was pretty sure i had the best hand but i wasnt going to make it into a big pot and risk getting check raised
4382670 i was just going to let him fire into the pot
4382671 when he checked the river i checked behind him because i didnt want to get check raised i didnt have the nuts if i bet he could check raise in that spot and id have to fold because so many hands had gotten there on the river
4382672 theres really not any equity in playing big pots unless youve flopped the joint and youre the one making it big
4382673 we had this game circled ever since it came out
4382674 a few of us felt like we needed this game to show we mean business and are serious about the gold medal
4382675 i had a lady cry when she came up to me
4382676 she came up to me asked me for an autograph and as i started to sign it she started crying literally crying i couldnt believe that i felt like the pope for a minute i just play basketball
4382677 we say it all the time we feel like the beatles
4382678 theres nothing like it the chinese have been outstanding whenever we leave the hotel go to the athletes village they are there urging us on its greatly appreciated and were going to need it
4382679 the other day it was pouring down raining and there was still a group outside of about 100 kids just waiting chasing the bus in the rain
4382680 we come out here every summer to do clinics and stuff like that and i have always been pretty popular but i dont know when this happened
4382681 i heard the red wings put in a claim on me
4382682 you see a happy vacation spot we can send people to
4382683 i dont so well have to do the best we can
4382684 i have never been a believer in chiropractic for horses never
4382685 i am now i was throwing darts i couldnt leave any stone unturned i had to do everything and anything basically the only thing i wasnt doing was calling the horse psychic
4382686 its a scary thing when youve got a horse named snow white that youre doing it to
4382687 if it was a 20 claimer 50 claimer even 100 claimer you wouldnt think so much about it
4382688 she loves it absolutely enjoys it anything you have to do to her shell let you she knows youre trying to help her
4382689 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4382690 a lot of times fans worldwide in general they say well you are making all this money you are supposed to take it or i paid to come to the game so i can let you know anything and say anything i want
4382691 well i have kids ive got a wife ive got mom and dad before i was a ballplayer i was a person and i am a person the same way you are so you say something as a person forget the uniform as a person i could say something back but because of the uniform i the fans can say anything i want to you and thats your armor thats your shield its just not true not at all
4382692 i might catch some flak for saying this but you know theyre front runners when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you
4382693 its not me its booing the guy who is out there working hard and busting his butt
4382694 thats when i really get upset ive always said that whatever you want to do against me i can deal with myself and im sure he could deal with it too but thats my teammate i know the work he is putting in i see what he is doing trying to get better and you are crushing him thats what makes me upset
4382695 in the 8 years weve been getting closer and closer last year we finally got over one obstacle and we are still working to get over another one
4382696 and its our fault as players for saying well we understand why because of this
4382697 i never want them to win as long as im playing dont get me wrong but take the team that you have and push them to be better dont take black friday i just found that out dont take black friday and put it on these new guys half of them dont even know it i didnt know it until 15 minutes ago 20 minutes ago black friday i was like is that like palm sunday you know about the history of the team dont get me wrong but when you are there you are trying to change that for that time period my tenure here were we successful thats all you can control
4382698 i dont think right at this moment hes a dl possibility
4382699 i dont need to talk about the all star game
4382700 if things arent in place by then it might take a few more days
4382701 every time you are stepping on the field you are looking to make plays
4382702 i was told that the forward was diving for a violation call to win a corner kick it is a common tactic but i dont think the chinese forward played it wisely this blunder only revealed his or the teams lousiness
4382703 keep the game tight is what i wanted and the guys came through

4382719 its a pain to do since i have to do them one at a time
4382720 but its still less than the cost of putting out a press release through a national news wire and its more personal so the response rate has been good so far
4382721 for three or four minutes everyone just stood there in complete silence

4382725 the tssa has been far more receptive and responsive than most to consumer advice and input
4382726 theres also this very profound kind of blurring of whos responsible when things go wrong and i think weve seen some of that in the last few days
4382727 i dont think these organizations would have been able to undertake the type of regulatory work they do without this type of model
4382728 im very disappointed for a professional organization like the tssa i would have expected they would have reliable and accurate information they could report to the public
4382729 in the past few months and particularly over the summer we have seen increasing signs that this parliament is really not working very well any more it is becoming increasingly dysfunctional
4382730 quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4382731 governing is more than not just being defeated in the house its also being able to pass legislation
4382732 this is the prime minister who made a virtue of passing fixed election date legislation and now hes threatening to cross sussex drive and go see his neighbour the governor general and ask for an election because hes fabricating a crisis where none exists
4382733 culture is an essential element of the identity of a nation and in that sense will always have its unfailing support
4382734 we still have a lot of fridays and youve got to use that
4382735 did not think it possible for a government to show so much contempt
4382736 but beyond our own survival this decision makes no sense on many levels at a time when canadian culture is extremely dynamic and is in demand all over the world this decision kills the cultural carte de visite for our embassies which need culture to lobby and to do business
4382737 i think we can do more and we should do more
4382738 these results are going to move their country forward and we have to learn how better to provide support for our athletes
4382739 we have to have a good hard look at how we fund our athletes our coaches our nutritionists lets get on with doing something its critical
4382740 who knows how many youngsters will start swimming because of michael phelps or 2007 world champion from b c brent hayden
4382741 yes you need to fund the foundation and you need to build from the ground up but you need to fund worthwhile elite athletes as well we have to invest in the athlete
4382742 but we can do more to help them attain their absolute best
4382743 i wasnt that good at any of them but i played
4382744 were coming up on the back half of the games
4382745 so well remain optimistic and of course well cheer for everybody who wears the maple leaf
4382746 i really like to train with the u s army and train on their equipment
4382747 we like to learn their ways of medical care so we can make ours better
4382748 the iraqi army medics seem anxious to learn medical skills
4382749 their willingness to work helps us train them because they want to learn and retain the training
4382750 who will be working with grasshopper manufacture and eap ea partners on the project
4382751 a great partner who shares our commitment to quality and innovation while respecting our independence as a studio which is very empowering
4382752 honoured to be working with mikami san and suda san on this new project
4382753 at the last minute weve been unable to reach mutually agreeable terms with valve on bcr so they wont be carrying it
4382754 i wont get into the details but we do continue to have a good relationship with valve and future capcom titles we expect to be carried on steam
4382755 ea partners gives independent developers like epic the muscle of a global publisher like ea along with the focus and flexibility of a smaller team committed to working with our individual needs
4382756 i have never seen a more respectable disciplined and organized iraqi police unit
4382757 the iraqi police have a great educational and developmental setup for the new iraqis enlisting in this police force
4382758 our soldiers are excited about working with the ip officers here
4382759 this ip station has a lot of potential and we look forward to training with the isf in the future
4382760 as a cornish family business were working hard to make all of our pubs welcoming inclusive and accessible for all our customers
4382761 as well as having menus in braille all of our staff are trained to assist blind and partially sighted diners by reading out menus including the specials board if thats what customers would prefer
4382762 st austells brewerys emphasis on making sure staff are trained and aware of the needs of blind and partially sighted customers is crucial to making their pubs welcoming to all customers and were delighted that they are investing in this
4382763 jangan takut hai maria sebab engkau beroleh kasih karunia di hadapan allah
4382764 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4382765 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4382766 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4382767 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4382768 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4382769 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4382770 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw
4382771 if youre built up and dont believe you can perform its a concern
4382772 getting the data out of the device and into the control system usually uses proprietary software that is not interoperable across platforms
4382773 he that is good for making excuses is seldom good for anything else
4382774 she always accepted her position in life as god put her here for some reason
4382775 she was going to do what she could to live that
4382776 allah taala berfirman wahai anak adam sesungguhnya engkau selama berdoa dan berharap kepada ku maka aku pasti akan memberikan ampunan kepadamu atas segala dosa dosamu
4382777 es ther stond op een vier meter hoge ladder om decoratiemateriaal op te hangen wat ze niet wist is dat een elektricien een dag eerder met bedrading bezig was ge weest hij had een fout gemaakt waardoor esther toen ze de stof wilde ophangen onder stroom kwam te staan mijn dochter hing letterlijk aan het plafond tot ie mand de stroom eraf haalde en ze van vier meter naar beneden klapte
4382778 esther had haar rug gebro ken haar handen waren hele maal verbrand toen ik het hoor de dacht ik we zijn haar kwijt dat zeiden ze ook dat de kans heel klein was dat ze het zou ha len
4382779 ze moest en zou naar curacao die gedachte heeft haar zowel tijdens de maanden in het ziekenhuis als gedurende anderhalf jaar revalidatie bezig gehouden en waarschijnlijk er doorheen gesleept
4382780 alles stond in het teken van haar vertrek in gedachten zat ze al op curacao maanden van tevoren waren de koffers met zomerkleren gepakt ze kocht al leen dingen die ze op het eiland zou kunnen gebruiken
4382781 we wa ren blij dat we haar ruim ander half jaar dicht bij ons mochten hebben dat we haar niet alleen als kind maar ook als volwassen vrouw goed hadden leren ken nen
4382782 het was tijd voor haar om haar eigen weg te gaan maar we waren bang dat ze teleurgesteld zou worden zou ze het wel redden
4382783 esther was dat ook niet nooit geweest en wij willen ook geen medelijden
4382784 je hebt geen idee wat er allemaal bij een overlijden komt kijken zeker als het iemand betreft die in een an der land woont
4382785 dat was zo vanaf de dag dat ze op het eiland aan kwam werk een huis een auto het lukte allemaal weliswaar woonde ze alleen maar de relatie met mark was ook nieuw leven ingeblazen ze was veel zelfstan diger nu niet alleen in vergelij king tot na het ongeluk maar ook met daarvoor ze genoot van die zelfstandigheid en ze was zeker niet alleen
4382786 ik heb uw dochter ge kend ze was een graag geziene gast
4382787 ik mocht niet betalen omdat esther een be kende was
4382788 esther was zo in nemend dat iedereen haar on middellijk in hun hart sloot
4382789 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4382790 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4382791 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4382792 if someone wants to discuss changes to that theyre going to have to bring that up with us
4382793 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4382794 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4382795 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4382796 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4382797 has been very very difficult for the city and for the state
4382798 this rally will be part of a massive outpouring of protest in denver and minneapolis against the two corporate controlled parties and their policies of perpetual militarism and war
4382799 we face a lot of legislative and regulatory issues we resourced our advocacy to match our challenges
4382800 the association is pleased that hhs is taking its advice
4382801 had thought a great deal about the potential of the vice presidency carter talked at length about how he saw the office as a wasted national asset he was determined to use his vice presidency in a way no president had done previously
4382802 made it clear to carter that he did not want to be considered if it was to be a strictly ceremonial office he was only interested in a truly substantive role
4382803 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4382804 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4382805 for us to be anywhere close to double digits represented a huge change from the past
4382806 now in august weve had two new polls one showing about a 6 point lead one a 7 point lead
4382807 but franklin said there has been a shift statewide in party identification
4382808 so the upshot of that is theres been a shift in party balance over the last four years that could be very important to the state and democratic candidates in the state
4382809 i think the polls that come out a week or two after the conventions are going to be critical for telling us whether were going to be again one of these competitive swing states or whether the state has shifted enough that one candidate or the other will maintain a lead
4382810 garbage collectors would inspect san francisco residents trash to make sure pizza crusts arent mixed in with chip bags or wine bottles under a proposal by mayor gavin newsom
4382811 jimmy i dont want you playing with the williams boys anymore their family doesnt recycle
4382812 we now live in a society where sunday church attendance is down but people wouldnt dream of missing their weekly trek to the altar of the recycling center
4382813 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4382814 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4382815 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4382816 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4382817 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
4382818 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4382819 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4382820 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4382821 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4382822 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4382823 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4382824 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4382825 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4382826 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4382827 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4382828 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4382829 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4382830 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4382831 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4382832 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4382833 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4382834 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4382835 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4382836 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4382837 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
4382838 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
4382839 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
4382840 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
4382841 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
4382842 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
4382843 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
4382844 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
4382845 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
4382846 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
4382847 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
4382848 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4382849 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4382850 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4382851 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4382852 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4382853 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4382854 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4382855 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4382856 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4382857 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4382858 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4382859 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4382860 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4382861 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4382862 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4382863 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4382864 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4382865 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4382866 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4382867 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4382868 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4382869 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4382870 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4382871 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly
4382872 a military force serving the interests of the democratic party
4382873 revive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country
4382874 means confusion distraction of business and the reopening of wounds now happily healed
4382875 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
4382876 with the election of harry truman democrats began the fight to bring down the final barriers of race
4382877 democrats began to bring down the final barriers of race
4382878 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4382879 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4382880 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4382881 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4382882 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4382883 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4382884 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4382885 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4382886 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4382887 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4382888 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4382889 the last eight years have been nothing short of a disaster
4382890 we need a new start not only domestically but internationally
4382891 i am very delighted to see that the obamas campaign has reached out to many community activists from all asian american and pacific islander communities including those who erstwhile were ardent supporters of hillary clinton and john edwards
4382892 is from a new generation of leaders as immigrants to this country we can easily identify ourselves with his life story he is an inspiration for our children born here that is perhaps the reason why so many of young generation indian americans have flocked to his campaign obama has also surrounded himself with many political veterans of indian origin
4382893 each of these individuals are deeply committed to ensuring that the rapidly growing south asian american communities are engaged and participating in this years historic elections
4382894 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
4382895 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
4382896 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
4382897 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
4382898 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
4382899 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
4382900 who will be the next president of the united states
4382901 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
4382902 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
4382903 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
4382904 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
4382905 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
4382906 someone driving to work goes past a petrol station and sees petrol at a bargain price and thinks you beauty but when they drive home its gone up 10c a litre it makes people very angry
4382907 australians dont want that great volatility in prices but nor do they want to pay more for their petrol to do away with it
4382908 the government wants to see an end to the days when you drive past a petrol station in the morning and see a certain price and drive past in the afternoon and see a price 10c or 15c a litre higher
4382909 i just dont think its going to do what its meant to do
4382910 republican presidential candidate john mccain now enjoys a healthy 88 7 percent lead over barack obama among republicans
4382911 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4382912 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
4382913 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
4382914 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
4382915 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4382916 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how
4382917 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
4382918 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4382919 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4382920 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole
4382921 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4382922 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4382923 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4382924 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4382925 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4382926 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4382927 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4382928 once again corporate decisions to put one of the worst in charge are costing chronicle readers one of the best
4382929 i think these ballots need to be up in tallahassee now so whatever needs to be done can be done quickly
4382930 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4382931 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4382932 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4382933 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4382934 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4382935 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4382936 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4382937 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4382938 hes a crybaby jon we are so lucky hes not our president
4382939 cause theyre real quiet you can go sneakin up on a mother
4382940 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4382941 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
4382942 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
4382943 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
4382944 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
4382945 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4382946 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4382947 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4382948 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4382949 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4382950 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4382951 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4382952 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4382953 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4382954 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4382955 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4382956 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4382957 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
4382958 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4382959 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4382960 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4382961 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4382962 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4382963 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4382964 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4382965 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4382966 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4382967 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4382968 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4382969 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4382970 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4382971 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4382972 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4382973 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4382974 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4382975 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4382976 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4382977 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4382978 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4382979 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4382980 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4382981 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4382982 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4382983 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4382984 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4382985 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4382986 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4382987 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4382988 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4382989 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4382990 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4382991 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4382992 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4382993 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4382994 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4382995 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4382996 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4382997 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4382998 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4382999 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4383000 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4383001 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4383002 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4383003 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4383004 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4383005 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4383006 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4383007 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4383008 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4383009 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4383010 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4383011 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4383012 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4383013 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4383014 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4383015 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4383016 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4383017 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4383018 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4383019 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4383020 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4383021 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4383022 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4383023 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4383024 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4383025 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4383026 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4383027 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4383028 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4383029 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4383030 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4383031 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4383032 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

4383034 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4383035 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4383036 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4383037 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4383038 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4383039 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4383040 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4383041 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4383042 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4383043 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4383044 the thoroughbred who leads too early and by too great a margin is more often than not the vulnerable one the one in danger of losing it all to the horse who strategically holds back waits and then thunders in the final furlongs to finish first
4383045 wake up youre liberal how we can take america back from the right
4383046 for climate changes he glosses over that this local planetary system is in constant change and we cant accurately measure the recent relatively small changes and anthropogenic contributions are an open question
4383047 how would the developers in this audience feel if the news media were opining on the benefits of one programming language over another and other people with no knowledge of programming were making strong statements based on what theyd read or heard in the media
4383048 im curious robert whether you are also skeptical about evolution that would be a good litmus test of whether this is a political religious disagreement or a scientific one
4383049 right now your choices are between the scientists who are actually conducting the research and analysis and pundits who are opining on something that they have no data research or proper science to support
4383050 most scientists think that global warming is an issue i think its bunk
4383051 there no agreement among scientists that weather patterns are changing as a result of human activity
4383052 look they are saying there may be the equivalent of war crimes trials one day
4383053 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4383054 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4383055 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4383056 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4383057 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4383058 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4383059 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4383060 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4383061 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4383062 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4383063 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4383064 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4383065 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4383066 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4383067 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
4383068 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
4383069 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
4383070 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
4383071 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
4383072 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
4383073 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
4383074 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
4383075 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
4383076 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
4383077 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
4383078 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
4383079 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
4383080 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
4383081 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
4383082 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4383083 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4383084 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
4383085 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
4383086 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
4383087 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
4383088 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
4383089 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
4383090 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
4383091 one thing people always say is that they live in a residential area or they dont want the farm next door to them
4383092 but if its zoned for agricultural or not zoned at all we take the appropriate steps from there when it comes to permitting
4383093 we are just waiting but its definitely been a hardship on my family
4383094 you have to wait when all youre trying to do is make a better life for your children
4383095 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4383096 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4383097 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4383098 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4383099 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4383100 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4383101 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4383102 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4383103 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4383104 delegates will be compelled to sleep five and six and perhaps more in a room
4383105 and in a good many instances two delegates will have to occupy the same bed
4383106 the men here are less prosperous looking than those who gathered for the republican convention in chicago they more obviously represent the masses the farmer element is everywhere distinguishable the majority of the delegates come from the soil and they look it
4383107 the mccain campaign relies on big money lobbyists and theyll rely on him
4383108 in the you scratch my back world of washington 931 million gets the special interests the best government money can buy but just think of the payday these lobbyists might expect in a mccain administration
4383109 tactics techniques and tips as an online talk show host i am proud to share the benefits with my audience
4383110 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
4383111 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
4383112 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
4383113 we dont stop playing because we grow old we grow old because we stop playing
4383114 ganesh acharya had promised me that akshay kumar would be making a guest appearance for one of the songs mash a allah the next thing i know ganesh himself was dancing on screen in that song yeh ek bhanyankar surprise thaa it was a terrible surprise for me
4383115 it was something beyond my imagination to see ganesh in akshays place there was a vast difference between what ganesh had said and what he finally delivered
4383116 film ko badi maar maari hai critics ne critics have trashed the film that neednt have been
4383117 from now on ive decided to be only an actor in a film theres no need to advise the director specially if he thinks he knows best
4383118 i dont know how it happened even members of ones own family stop listening to you after a point ganesh felt i shouldnt interfere in his writing skills and that i should just listen to him on the sets
4383119 thoda ussmein director jag gaya the director in him become aggressive
4383120 he never discussed it with me i didnt even know about this characters existence in the plot when i finally saw the film i asked ganesh bhaiyya yeh kya hai i think somewhere while discussing the commercial angle with me ganesh lost his way
4383121 i cant figure out when prem chopraji came into my picture and why hes a senior actor and i felt ganesh was portraying him crudely i did tell him that
4383122 but ill say this my films usually speak a language of innocence that was lost in money hai to honey hai i thought i was doing a film about team spirit little did i know that so much bitterness would creep in even in the choreography i found upen patels song to be dicey
4383123 i dont believe in poking fun at people who have achieved so much i didnt know about ekta but i was told about vijay mallya and laxmi mittals names being used i was told they were being mentioned with reverence so i kept quiet
4383124 traditionally copyright owners sold their copyrighted material in exchange for money
4383125 the lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration however
4383126 my film is not at all any movies remake it is inspired from a village folk tale about a brahmin it is a modern version of a desi indian story it is a commercial film that leaves a message with humour
4383127 im waiting for the film to release so that audiences can see for themselves what its about even sanjay dutt was surprised after watching the film at a preview he told me that he had previously thought it was a remake of the english film
4383128 it is a custom in the industry to predict and guess the story of a film after seeing the initial rushes
4383129 considering the title of my film and that amitabh bachchan is playing the almighty who wears only white clothes everyone concluded that it is a copy of the hollywood comedy however no one noticed that even rishi kapoor played god and wore only white clothes in thoda pyaar thoda magic
4383130 i wanted to direct a film that no one had ever attempted to considering the technical aspects i have used in the film god tussi also has special effects to keep audiences glued to their seat
4383131 i didnt face any problem while directing the film the film went very smoothly as amitabh and salman had already been pushing me to direct a film for a long time
4383132 i didnt take up direction earlier because i wanted to learn its technical aspects also i needed to find the right subject i wanted to work on
4383133 coolie no 1 says he will continue to write scripts even though direction is his new passion
4383134 writing is my first love if i get an exciting offer ill definitely do it as of now my entire focus is on direction every person looks for a change however ill write at least one film every year

4383139 man wird der bundeskanzlerin unseren standpunkt ausf hrlich erl utern und auch wirklich handfeste beweise vorlegen die die gr ueltaten der georgischen soldateska in s dossetien belegen
4383140 aber er wird der kanzlerin klarmachen dass die osteurop ischen eu l nder nicht allein die russland politik der eu bestimmen d rfen das w rde eine echte partnerschaft verhindern

4383145 if theres not continued access of humanitarian supplies if civilians are not protected if they are limited in where they can move its something that could develop into a crisis

4383184 because of the complexity of erp suites saas offerings for administrative and operational functions typically have provided functionality that is confined to one domain such as sales force automation or one business process such as payroll
4383185 much predicted growth in this market will be driven by the adoption of human capital management saas and financial saas point solutions
4383186 the growth rate for saas erp suites will be a small proportion of the overall market growth because mature robust solutions are unlikely to emerge by 2011
4383187 appeals to organisations because it can free up staff to concentrate on more strategic value adding processes
4383188 however the business still must be re engineered processes redefined integration points defined and so on
4383189 the instant on perception that drives adoption also makes it an inhibitor
4383190 saas erp suites likely will be significant and may not compare favourably with on premises solutions
4383191 the multitenant architecture needed for saas erp suites results in high internal efforts and costs for the initial setup and the ongoing maintenance and upgrade of the system
4383192 vendors must prove to organisations that are considering saas erp adoption that their security and privacy concerns are unfounded through super low cost or no cost proof of concept trials encouraging early adoption through value pricing and getting early adopters to share their success stories
4383193 saas erp will continue to grow particularly at the administrative level
4383194 however the complexities of integrated erp suites along with a lack of credible vendor interest in this segment means that truly integrated offerings such as saas erp suites for large enterprises are unlikely to emerge in the near future

4383198 ne vjerujem da sam osvojila zlato godinama sam naporno radila sve sam podredila nastupu u pekingu i na koncu se isplatilo
4383199 nije ovo rezultat s kojim sam zadovoljan ali finalom svakako jesam kona no mi se otvorilo u kvalifikacijama na velikim natjecanjima
4383200 i ostala dva hica su bila dobra ali su dotaknula za titnu ogradu tako da bi zadnji hitac oti ao i preko 78 metara imao sam dobru tehniku no i prekratko zagrijavanje jer sam bacio samo jedan hitac a obi no bacam tri etiri
4383201 ono po to sam do ao u peking a to je finale ostvario sam zadovoljio sam dakle sve ostale a sada je vrijeme da u finalu usre im sebe spreman sam za iznena enje
4383202 jako sam zadovoljna sve ono to smo planirali u dva tjedna intenzivnih treninga smo ostvarili meni je bilo dosta bitno da se psihi ki odmorim da svje a krenem na put i stvarno sam onog trenutka kad smo krenuli rekla sebi dobro sad si sve napravila sad ide drugi dio svega
4383203 takve ozljedice se doga aju kad je previ e skakanja i to nije bilo previ e ozbiljno to su usputne traume kako ih ja zovem mislim da je propu tanje londona bio pravi potez jer sam se uspjela odmoriti prije nego smo krenuli s treninzima i to se pokazalo klju no jer sam ta dva tjedna uspjela odradit na visokoj razini kvalitetno ba kao i prije osake
4383204 pa to sam htjela i pro le godine poslije atene sam bila nesretna i rekla sam sebi da e sljede e olimpijske igre biti malo druga ije taj pritisak koji dolazi s dobrim rezultatima je dio sporta koji sam ja odlu ila prihvatiti i ne u bje ati od uloge favorita mislim da nema smisla zavaravati sebe i druge

4383220 i think you can sometimes sense especially when he is interviewing alex salmond that he has a difficulty about scotland and scottish culture and it is possible that might be contributing to his views on burns
4383221 burns is a subtle and consummate poet and i dont think we need to worry about what jeremy paxman says about him
4383222 one of the fine things about burns is that he was not sentimental
4383223 of course he wrote a lot of trash but at his best he respected ordinary people and took their feelings seriously
4383224 divided between satire and sentimentality explosive vernacular and insipid english vigorous bawdry and pietistic moralising who was prevented from writing sustained poetry of the very highest sort
4383225 jeremy paxman should spend more time reading burns as burns wrote in to a louse o wad some powr the giftie gie us to see oursels as others see us in light of his daft comments about burns jeremy looks like a gowk

4383359 im very encouraged by the fact that pat gillespie has been willing to sit down listen to our comments and include them in the buy sell agreement
4383360 im really into science and i wanted to do this
4383361 science is interesting and i like working with chemicals but doing the 3 d computer renderings was really hard
4383362 this age group in 10 years will be going to college
4383363 we can get them ready dwight rich is a very good program these kids will be the ones going to mars
4383364 we had to turn away people and bring in another teacher we wanted to share what we do with students at dwight rich
4383365 there are flames on it and those are very fast
4383366 i am excited about seeing elliot sadler win and feel the ground rumble with the fast cars
4383367 in traditional court you get a slap on the hand it really doesnt teach people
4383368 the construction is really bad it has been really hard on us
4383369 one day i came into work and i just cried i dont know how we can survive
4383370 it will be two to three hours with no customers all i can think of is how to pay the bills
4383371 sometimes i want to just close but i cant do that my family has put all of their income into the business
4383372 most of the people i know who drive here go somewhere else now
4383373 we had a lady drive around for three hours because she couldnt find us
4383374 we work very hard to make sure people can still see and feel comfortable going into businesses
4383375 part of our education is having businesses understand that the cso project is an environmental project
4383376 its not just rebuilding the roads although that certainly may not help their bottom line we have been turning up the volume on working with businesses and getting people to the downtown area
4383377 ive taken the approach that i cant control it we will be tickled pink when this is all done
4383378 for the most part all of our projects appear to be on schedule and on track

4383381 it constantly haunts me to think about what might have happened if id made it that weekend
4383382 the disability experience is quite frequently outside the scope of what policy makers know
4383383 a torturer who uses sex as a weapon to degrade and destroy his victims
4383384 his progress has been monitored closely by our physiotherapist and doctor and his overall participation in the series will be determined as we get closer to the date
4383385 the nsp has reserved the right to add a 15th player into this squad should this become necessary
4383386 that was pretty much a drubbing really and thats not a true reflection of the two sides i think were a better side than that
4383387 whoever youre playing for its always disappointed to get beaten like that when you know you should have done better because you walk off the field thinking we mucked up today and it should have been a lot tighter than that
4383388 were probably more used to that sort of pitch than those guys are it was a little damp in the morning but even so we should have been a little bit smarter with bat and ball
4383389 i dont think we were particularly smart today with the bat
4383390 we lost a poor toss and the conditions were fairly tough early on and it was a slow pitch but we let ourselves down
4383391 we should probably have got up to around 220 or 230 and we were probably not quite on it early on with the ball as well
4383392 dale steyn is a fantastic bowler and asked some good questions early on and we didnt do that enough and then herschelle gibbs showed us how to play a one day innings
4383393 i was lucky to get away with getting caught off a no ball so i thought it might be a good day for me
4383394 ive been playing for a while at lashings and glamorgan before that so i thought today that id take my time to get in and use it as a bit of preparation
4383395 there have been lots of reports about corrupt practices in nusaf since the programme was launched but no harsh steps have been taken against the culprits yet our people who should have benefited from the funds are suffering
4383396 lira is not very far from gulu moreover the nusaf headquarters are here so netting the suspects will be very easy for us
4383397 ahead of the curve two years at harvard business school
4383398 you have been found not guilty you are discharged from these proceedings and you are free to go
4383399 you should not have any second thoughts about your decision
4383400 you will never be better informed than you are at this moment
4383401 amplia detallada y explicando todos los motivos por los cuales considera que su culpabilidad es ninguna
4383402 before the parks maintenance staff began cleaning anthills were under a mattress in the master bedroom maggots crept around the trailer and roaches roamed inside the fridge
4383403 together with the 117 03 off accumulated post judgment interest the total amount of the 107 951 03 has been fully paid and satisfied by the judgment creditors
4383404 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
4383405 i saw hearts that had been taken from live people
4383406 i used to go over to have lunch with doris and jim and i would sit across from jim at the kitchen table and think before me is a true american hero
4383407 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments
4383408 they said a wife of one of the ss officers they called her the bitch of buchenwald saw a tattoo she liked on the arm of a prisoner and had the skin made into a lampshade i saw that
4383409 its important that we dont allow ourselves to lose him
4383410 its the memory of heroes like james hoyt and the memories of what theyve done that we must ensure that we keep alive and share with the current generation and future generations
4383411 mr hoyt as a young man saw unspeakable horrors when he was one of the soldiers to discover the buchenwald concentration camp and those are experiences as a country and a world we can never forget
4383412 you think back on a young man 19 years old and to have the experience that he had
4383413 a symbol of the chill blooded cruelty of the german nazi state
4383414 there is reason to believe that the prompt arrival of the 6th armored division on the scene saved many hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives
4383415 at the same time a group of russians just escaped from the concentration camp burst out of the woods attempting to attack the ss men the russians were restrained and interrogated
4383416 as guides to investigate report and rejoin as rapidly as possible
4383417 i took this side journey of about 3 km away from our main force because we kept encountering ss guards and prison inmates and the latter told us of the large camp to the south
4383418 we had been told by our intelligence that we might overrun a large prison camp but we or at least i had no idea of either the gigantic size of the camp or of the full extent of the incredible brutality
4383419 we were tumultuously greeted by what i was told were 21 000 men and what an incredible greeting that was
4383420 i was picked up by arms and legs thrown into the air caught thrown again caught thrown etc until i had to stop it i was getting dizzy
4383421 how the men found such a surge of strength in their emaciated condition was one of those bodily wonders in which the spirit sometimes overcomes all weaknesses of the flesh my but it was a great day
4383422 the worst concentration camp yet to be uncovered by west wall troops
4383423 seeing these things it changes you i was a kid
4383424 des moines had been the furthest id ever been from home i still have horrific dreams usually someone needs help and i cant help them im in a situation where im trapped and i cant get out
4383425 thinking back i would have pushed to be a psychologist if for no other reason than to understand myself better
4383426 memories of evil get erased for life must go on and new generations cannot be locked in the past but they would do well to remember the past
4383427 when the prisoners saw jim they picked him up and threw him in the air thats how happy they were after seeing such horrors prisoners had been hung from hooks to die he saw a lampshade made from a prisoners tattoo jim carried those horrors with him forever he never got what he had seen out of his mind if you ever wondered about jim think about what he saw
4383428 when you were discharged no one really gave a hoot about you it was difficult for a compassionate person like jim to forget what he saw he was a hero
4383429 amd glaubt an offene industriestandards und unterst tzt deshalb die xhci spezifikation
4383430 just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it
4383431 have to respond using not diplomatic but military technological methods
4383432 these missiles have been used by the russians tactically for psychological and military targets as the georgians do not have the capability to defend against or defeat ballistic missiles
4383433 our arguments about the need for a permanent presence of u s troops and missiles on polish soil have been taken seriously by the american side
4383434 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
4383435 whether or not the actions of the past several days spurred on final action
4383436 my first reaction was its a sidthimunki but i have never put any in this tank so i quickly grabbed two nets and attempted to pick up the piece of bogwood the small fish went into
4383437 this bogwood is full of crevices and i noticed that what ever this fish was it had gone into one of these on starting to pick up the bogwood the fish shot out of the crevice straight into the net if it had gone the other way i probably would never have caught it again
4383438 i had a good idea what it was at this point but just couldnt believe it i mean kubotais havent bred naturally in tanks before
4383439 was at the time was that nothing else would enter the pipe and the clowns in particular stayed towards the other end of the tank but i didnt really think anything of it
4383440 i think they have spawned more or less as soon as i got them i think the fact that they were in such a large shoal in the shop may have got them into breeding condition and it was going to happen anyway
4383441 i do think that keeping any loach species in large groups is the key i have spawned acanthocobitis zonalternans of which i had 10 adults sewellia lineolata 8 adults and the sidthimunkis of which i had 36 adults at the time spawning took place
4383442 you have to make a good film that would be a good film under any circumstances
4383443 you have to put the narrative first the reality is no matter how many 3 d screens we get you are still going to have a large number of people possibly the majority of people who see the film in a 2 d environment
4383444 hannah montana and miley cyrus best of both worlds concert
4383445 the systems themselves in my opinion can handle any creative challenge
4383446 the way we developed the performance capture workflow on avatar
4383447 that is going though facial algorithms and going back into the camera as a real time cg face of the character
4383448 you see it talk you see the eyes move it is pretty phenomenal
4383449 once weve laid down a take the take exists in the digital asset management system
4383450 its this amazing ability to quickly conjure scenes and images and great fantasyscapes that is very visual we call it director centric because i can use the camera to block the actors
4383451 when you are doing performance capture creatively its very daunting its very hard to imagine what it will look like but if you can see it if you can have a virtual image of what is it going to be like then you are there as the processing power goes up our models get more sophisticated and our lighting tools get more sophisticated even while we are making this movie im still doing a lot of virtual camera work on the film on stuff that was shot six months ago
4383452 we changed the words and he redid the dialogue we didnt have to recapture his body performance and he didnt have to put the performance capture suit on again we were just creating new words and we were creating a new face
4383453 one movie where the aesthetics of physical production and the aesthetics of virtual production are to the extent that we could do it pretty much it identical
4383454 were taking our virtual production toolset and superimposing it on physical production
4383455 we turned the set on the soundstage into a capture volume and turned the physical camera into a capture virtual camera so we were able to integrate cg characters and environments into our live action
4383456 we have people in flying vehicles and i can see what is outside the window fed in in real time
4383457 are we looking at a situation maybe 10 15 years out where most laptops are sold with 3 d stereoscopic screens most montors are stereo compatible most dvd players can run stereo content i can see this becoming much more pervasive that we are thinking now
4383458 its not just the short term impact on children and their families its the long term impact on the reputation of the city
4383459 this is a good indication that their immune systems are not functioning efficiently
4383460 these parents are sometimes extremely stressed and what they need is appropriate help and training
4383461 however knowing the effects that providing round the clock care can have on their health may help raise awareness that these parents need help to manage their burden of care
4383462 we are continuing this work by looking at how sleep patterns affect the rates of infection in these parents
4383463 carers often display great strength and resilience whilst coping with this complex disability but many receive very little help and support and are under considerable stress as a result
4383464 it is imperative that carers are given access to services such as short break schemes to help them before they reach a crisis point
4383465 i am not surprised at the results of this study it just confirms what we already suspected might be one of the consequences of the constant stress that families have to endure
4383466 as the cost of fuel rises thieves are actively targeting fuel tanks and goods yards across the force area
4383467 the council neglected his education and in doing so discriminated against his aspergers
4383468 they had to provide for him but didnt think they had to follow the law if we had taken him out of school the council would have fined us
4383469 doncaster did not make any efforts to secure an alternative school place i had to find the school place for mathew
4383470 the law in relation to excluded pupils is crystal clear councils have a duty to make full time education for all pupils from day six of a permanent exclusion
4383471 if doncaster had taken urgent action to find a school place for mathew in december 2007 it could probably have found a much cheaper place
4383472 however because doncaster did not take action it had no choice but to accept when the school offered a place for over 150 000 there was no alternative and doncaster had no time to negotiate
4383473 parents in doncaster need to be aware that doncaster is not meeting its duties to excluded pupils and legal action seems to be the only way to secure education for excluded pupils
4383474 we do not comment on individual cases but can confirm we have worked with mr and mrs haslam to identify a suitable school placement starting from september that can meet mathews needs
4383475 to tamper with a war memorial which is never out of the top three of the best kept war memorials in scotland and not even discuss it with the legion is a disgrace
4383476 when i hear those bells ring out i always think about the servicemen of galashiels who gave their lives in two world wars
4383477 for the flow of history to be interrupted on the basis of a single noise complaint seems frankly ridiculous
4383478 after an investigation by environmental health it has now been decided the chimes will be stopped between midnight and 7 15am
4383479 the clock dates back to the time when most people would not have had clocks at home and relied on the chimes to help them tell the time day or night
4383480 the council had a legal obligation to act based on the findings of environmental health and consultation would not have changed that fact
4383481 weakness in the u s and spanish markets will combine with unfavorable weather conditions and adverse calendar effects
4383482 we are unanimous that we have a problem with a rock quarry in limestone county and that bill has been unnecessarily held up and has been held for five weeks
4383483 we want a public hearing this week and want it put to a vote of the committee
4383484 they dont want us to call public hearings on the bills
4383485 they want to stall talk to other legislators run out the time so we cant pass them
4383486 butler is pretty sharp on the rules but we may be doing the same thing in the house that theyre doing in the senate
4383487 they quarry supporters can use all the stalling tactics they want to we have some tricks up our sleeves too
4383488 its pretty close to the surface in that area a lot of people have well water in that area when they quarries dig these holes they disrupt a lot of nurseries that use water there are also a lot of concerns about schools and the nuclear plant
4383489 overwhelmingly the meetings they opponents had they did not want that rock quarry it would affect the water supply if they started blasting and drilling
4383490 also theres been an issue with browns ferry nuclear plant there was some research on that
4383491 i was just told that little is not allowing that local bill to come up who is involved and the parties that may be behind it i dont know
4383492 i want to thank my family friends and voters who supported my candidacy for town council
4383493 i plan to continue my quest to meet the needs of our citizens by being a member of the town council
4383494 its been a learning experience and i enjoyed the process
4383495 due to some personal crises i was unable to get that done
4383496 ecologys water quality permitting system holds each facility that receives a permit accountable for collecting and reporting information about its discharges
4383497 self reporting is a serious requirement not a free pass
4383498 ce nest pas parce que vous tes chez nous que vous devez faire nimporte quoi
4383499 i got 19 requests to read my screenplay using scriptblaster
4383500 to put the world in order we must first put the nation in order to put the nation in order we must put the family in order to put the family in order we must cultivate our personal life and to cultivate our personal life we must first set our hearts right

4383502 i believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality
4383503 the investment we are making in our new roadshow means brokers will have the opportunity to find out first hand how the eurodebt introducer scheme could work for them
4383504 all persons interviewed highly recommended him for a position of trust and responsibility
4383505 dreyfus urged republicans to open their doors to people who had too long been excluded from party affairs women minorities urban workers and students
4383506 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4383507 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4383508 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4383509 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4383510 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4383511 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4383512 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4383513 this is a very unwelcome and unacceptable kind of activity in china
4383514 everybody in china knows that tibet is an inalienable part of the territory of china
4383515 i see actually most of the people in these demonstrations are non chinese so i would conclude they dont really know very much about the situation
4383516 its only through mutual understanding that we can have peace in the world and we can actually have a better chance of trying to solve issues and not stir up further trouble
4383517 ask me a straight question and ill try and answer it
4383518 die unparteiischen sind es gewohnt von john beleidigt zu werden und zeigen sich deshalb durchaus nachsichtig aber heute hat er die grenze schlichtweg berschritten

4383526 his progress has been monitored closely by our physiotherapist and doctor and his overall participation in the series will be determined as we get closer to the date

4383530 we west indies only have a tour at the beginning and one later on next year so i hope i can be here for a bit longer longer than a month and a bit
4383531 the controller directed him back and shortly after that there was the altitude deviation
4383532 it is like you are taking a road to the city everyone is going on that road it is just a course straight to the airport
4383533 they are already lined up in the runway even though it can be many miles to it
4383534 we sometimes have limited information about what was going on with the plane and the pilot
4383535 we only go as far as the evidence will support
4383536 your comments in their original format will remain on my blog to protect my intellectual copyrights and serve as proof of initiation of the communication exchange between you and i if you feel the need to unprotect certain comments on your own blog out of spite i cant change that
4383537 words are selfish spiteful and downright despicable sometimes especially from an adoption standpoint
4383538 but worst yet im a liar because i mustve told the other person things
4383539 i had been with john for about three years he was a really nice guy and i enjoyed being with him but there wasnt a ton of passion
4383540 most everyone we knew had gotten engaged and though john would have proposed in a second whenever he brought it up id change the subject
4383541 the reason i brought you here tonight is because i wanted this to be a special moment for us
4383542 where is that waiter its been like 5 minutes i clearly need a refill on my water the service at this place is horrid
4383543 god im so bloated i think im going to order a salad tonight
4383544 i took a trip to australia for work and while i was gone i got together with a co worker to whom id always been insanely attracted i had a fantastic trip probably because for the first time in a long time i experienced that excitement id been missing
4383545 i experienced that excitement id been missing getting railed by a co worker and betraying my loving boyfriend while he wondered how my trip was going
4383546 i broke up with john soon after i returned home and began dating the guy from the trip
4383547 but not before my co worker and i had lots of sex on our bed while john was working overtime
4383548 even though im not super proud of my actions things ended up for the best after dating for a few years the guy from the trip and i got married and were incredibly happy together
4383549 right before i was going to break up with my ex sean he found out that he had to put his beloved dog to sleep he was so broken up about it that i didnt have the heart to end things so i waited a month or so until he was in better shape
4383550 when things seemed to be better and i was ready he lost his job so i felt like i was back to square one
4383551 by that time i had met someone else that i really wanted to start seeing so i went ahead and did it
4383552 nope not good enough i need to cheat on this dog killing job losing son of a bitch
4383553 i eventually ended things never telling sean about my extra curricular dating i think i rationalized that i was trying to spare his feelings
4383554 my boyfriend greg and i decided to do the long distance thing after i was accepted to a graduate program 200 miles from where we lived
4383555 the first few months were fine but i soon found myself becoming extremely attracted to my lab partner henry what began as innocent flirting eventually wound up with us in bed
4383556 but i didnt break up with him initially because i was still attracted to him too
4383557 i visited henry a few times and realized that he was really more of a fling probably born out of boredom and that greg was the one for me
4383558 hmmm maybe i should go visit that guy i cheated on him with a few times ugh i guess this is awkward i guess greg is definitely the one
4383559 i never told greg about what happened which occasionally makes me feel guilty but i chalk my cheating up to being young and silly he and i are still together four years since my program ended
4383560 i began dating eric shortly after i had been dumped by dave my boyfriend of two years i was devastated and eric was definitely a rebound thing
4383561 after eric and i had dated for five months dave came back and wanted to give things another shot i still really missed him so i began seeing him but never ended things with eric
4383562 i think i sort of kept eric around for insurance purposes just in case things didnt end up well with dave
4383563 and after eric discovered through mutual friends that i had been seeing him again he ended things with me
4383564 i definitely learned my lesson about dating two guys at the same time not to mention trying to rekindle a relationship thats just plain over
4383565 when i was younger i dated a guy named ethan who was really critical of me he constantly made little snide comments about my weight how stupid i was and how clumsy i was
4383566 for whatever odd reason i was into him despite the fact that all of my friends and family hated him
4383567 one weekend when he was away i met will at a party and we completely hit it off
4383568 he was the complete opposite of ethan kind sweet and generous yet completely cool and fun too we hung out all weekend and it was like a light bulb went off in my head this is how mature relationship worthy guys act
4383569 i hooked up with will the night before he left and broke up with ethan soon after will and i dated for three years and now were married
4383570 im from florida so i adore going to the beach and boating but my former boyfriend chris a total city boy hated it we always argued about where wed take trips and he always won
4383571 about eight months into our dating i took a trip to key west with my friends and we chartered a boat for the day the captain of the boat was this totally hot complete beach guy for life type and i spent the whole day flirting with him
4383572 we met him out that night and he and i got together i never told chris about it after i got home and i never felt guilty i think part of me felt like thats what chris got for being so stubborn
4383573 oh you dont love the beach fine ill just blow someone who does in the bathroom stall of fat tuesdays
4383574 chris and i didnt make it and after we broke up i made sure any future boyfriends loved the beach
4383575 my last boyfriend was a total player before we got together i thought i could change him
4383576 but i was wrong i always heard rumors that he was hooking up with other girls while we were dating but he always denied it
4383577 and i believed him i mean why wouldnt i what possibly could he have done in his past relationships to lead me to such a conclusion yes what indeed
4383578 one night i got a call from a girl he had been seeing and she detailed their three month long relationship to me and told me about another girl she had discovered he was seeing as well
4383579 oh thats right he was unfaithful before we started dating how silly of me
4383580 i was so mad that i went out with my friends that night dressed to kill and went home with the hottest guy i could find i felt like it was the least he deserved
4383581 went home with the hottest guy she could find and it was the least he deserved so essentially you called yourself ugly and the guy couldve done much better honesty for once
4383582 i loved seeing the look on his face when i told him about what i did and that i knew about the other girls and then i dumped him
4383583 how can i teach him a lesson that cheating is wrong and hurtful hmmm i know ill cheat on him
4383584 my ex was a terrible kisser the worst i really liked everything else about him but whenever it came time to get physical i just cringed
4383585 one night when i was at a party without him a bunch of people started this old school yet fairly intense game of spin the bottle
4383586 then we played some pin the tail on the donkey things got fairly crazy when mary nearly hit me with a plastic bat when she was blindfolded and swinging at the pinata
4383587 and i felt like i had to join as i hadnt had a decent kiss in a long time
4383588 gosh i feel like i have to join i havent had a decent crack high in a long time
4383589 i probably kissed about 10 guys that night all of whom were so much better than my ex
4383590 i ended things pretty quickly after that experience which made me realize that the physical part of a relationship is truly important
4383591 no one wants him to go away or give him a hard time
4383592 alle automaten voor het eind van de maand te hebben beveiligd tegen de zogenoemde skimfraude

4383598 een goede zoekfunctie kan duur zijn maar een slechte nog veel duurder
4383599 these individuals do not have any information about you or your financial accounts
4383600 do not call the number or ever give personal information over the telephone
4383601 the credit union will never call you for your personal information
4383602 held a special responsibility to conduct herself lawfully and responsibly
4383603 obviously we cant condone what happened certainly your honor but there is some mitigation it was not heroin it was not oxycontin it was not cocaine it was a prescription drug vicodin
4383604 she has basically lost everything even when she gets out of jail it is not something that is going to go away
4383605 we put our best effort to show there was no hand to hand transaction
4383606 i think we put on an airtight case the facts were undisputed the jury saw the facts for what they were
4383607 bruce and i have strong ties to the richmond community
4383608 we want to support the community and we want to be part of the community
4383609 i really have not ventured much out of richmond other than to go to nyc but given what ive seen here the civil war is still not over im sure there is a divided market
4383610 but my teammates busted their butts for me so i was going to bust mine for them
4383611 just because we didnt win state doesnt mean we cant play some ball
4383612 is a costly calling choosing to take a stand for life in the face of a culture of death may very well cost us everything and yet it is the very reason we are here on this earth today
4383613 we need to see gods blessings wealth possessions family time health as priceless treasures that we steward to further his kingdom and benefit others not as things to horde for our own pleasure
4383614 not everyone will suddenly become a christian but the difference between the believers and the rest of the world will be undeniable then whether or not the lost repent and turn their lives over to god they will have been convicted and they will be without excuse when they stand before the judge of the universe
4383615 i think this case presents some new questions and some hard questions
4383616 to what extent does the principal that two wrongs dont make a right come into play here
4383617 ruin the lives of people destroy their fortunes and it can take years to undo the damage all so she can make a political statement
4383618 perhaps it does have shock value but shock value does not equate to political speech
4383619 shock value has long had its place in political speech
4383620 seems to be saying is if the law is not perfect its not constitutional
4383621 some solutions that work in central pennsylvania may not work or be appropriate for richmond
4383622 youd be better off trying to get rid of a homeless person camping in your yard than having to deal with a stray cat
4383623 it wasnt cruel and it was necessary because it was going to happen anyway
4383624 what he did was not legal euthanasia it was illegal killing
4383625 this sends a clear message that people cant simply kill feral cats or other companion animals or treat them cruelly

4383637 there would not be a trigger to pull or a bomb to blow up without the resources to acquire such tools of terrorism and to bankroll the persons who actually commit the violence
4383638 providing indirect funding to an organization that was openly hostile to the united states does not constitute this type of intentional conduct

4383642 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4383643 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4383644 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4383645 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4383646 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty

4383648 without cancels usenet would have died under the weight of the spam long ago
4383649 aww theres just too many of them and hes always different
4383650 they have been rounding up horses by the thousands when they know there isnt enough of an adoption market to support it
4383651 they manufactured this emergency and they knew full well that they didnt have a long term solution to this problem
4383652 living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the west
4383653 all i can say is that maybe if a lot of people get upset about it then a lot of people will get on board to do something about it
4383654 we do a lot for people outside this country so how about doing something here for something that is near and dear to our hearts
4383655 this is the only way we can control the population
4383656 and if we let the herd explode theyd finish up foraging and then go outside that area
4383657 there just isnt money because were spending too much on feed
4383658 ideally wed like to adopt out as many as we are taking in
4383659 to say that there is an overpopulation of horses on the land is wildly debatable
4383660 the horses really get the short end of the stick because they dont make any money for anybody
4383661 the problem for the blm is that people really want the horses to be out there
4383662 you may be aware that the blms inability to administer the budget of the wild horses and burros program with any trace of fiscal accountability is a long standing concern and must not be used as a death sentence upon these celebrated symbols of the american west
4383663 it was like a wedding with music and flowers and dancing
4383664 the whole secular culture swallows up the idea of a consecrated life
4383665 there are a lot of young women out there and theyre afraid to listen to what god has to say some young women came and didnt stay you cant have one foot in the world
4383666 young women today have many options even if they do wish to serve
4383667 there are more opportunities to do similar things that we do education and social work
4383668 and the whole idea of a permanent commitment that this is what youre going to do for the rest of your life is scary to young people that has affected married life as well as groups like ourselves
4383669 there seems to be renewed interest out there and thats very hopeful for us
4383670 i said what do you mean i was praying for five hours i was kneeling i was so frustrated i cried
4383671 everything was suspended in time and all i could do was listen
4383672 once i surrendered everything and got rid of everything i dreamed of and desired and wanted i said do with me what you will
4383673 shes had work experience and education and social experience were very hopeful that this is truly her calling
4383674 of course there was fear but that went out the door when she moved into the convent
4383675 her spirit was always so gentle and this environment nurtures that gentle spirit
4383676 theyre just so happy to talk to me about my day and we just laugh all the time
4383677 all those times i was crying it was the holy spirit moving within me
4383678 at first they thought it was the result of heartbreak but its not im not running away from guys or anything like that
4383679 by choosing to fund the wci western climate initiative the attorney general and adeq have redirected 1 million that could have benefited the local community in this case south phoenix that was affected by honeywells alleged violations
4383680 this grew out of honeywells own interest in doing something to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
4383681 its benefiting everyone because the whole state region and globe is very seriously impacted by climate change
4383682 theres 5 million going to the general fund in the form of the penalty
4383683 what it boils down to quite simply is there is no money in the account
4383684 you get burnt once and you have to ask yourself can i do this again
4383685 said nancy tumosa a teacher at devereux an english language learners school in scottsdale
4383686 i feel stupid because i let it happen to me again to be honest i cant go another six weeks
4383687 people need to understand that its no different whether its a boat or a car
4383688 the dangers are still there and so therefore the penalty should be the same
4383689 we have teams coming from tucson we have teams coming from flagstaff
4383690 shes been an active member in our clubs now for five years
4383691 shes a huge draw our members love to have her come
4383692 we do have some athletes who are doing the sprint on their own and their physical abilities are just mind boggling
4383693 we noticed so many our athletes are involved with track and aquatics
4383694 its become very political i want to take the commission out of that discussion and allow people who are campaigning out there to do the work
4383695 maybe theyre afraid that the more the public knows about the redistricting proposal the less theyll like
4383696 we think the public will be very disappointed to hear that the forums have been canceled and were surprised that the commission doesnt want the public to know as much as possible about the proposal
4383697 we really just want to heal and move on with our lives now
4383698 for what theyre charging him with it would have to mean he put the dog in the car and said ill see you later buddy knowing the risk
4383699 unless you know tom and know his love for animals and how much he loved that guy you just cant understand
4383700 i think this should have been a long long time ago
4383701 parents and toy store owners can now be more comfortable that products are safe
4383702 this is something you shouldnt even have to think about
4383703 its really unbelievable that our government has not stepped in before now
4383704 we are glad to continue to support stronger and consistent national standards on product safety
4383705 we thank congress for working so diligently to pass this landmark legislation our shared mission is to protect our nations children
4383706 people will ask why our toys are 10 when they can go to another store and buy something for 2 the reason is that our toys have been through safety checks
4383707 i feel my family lives in a safe community but today is an entirely different world from the one i grew up in i simply want to be better informed especially when it comes to the safety of my children
4383708 i think its difficult for him to fix it because of the judgments hes made in the past and his lack of experience
4383709 if we are dissatisfied with obama as a potential president hillary cannot be expected to change our minds
4383710 theres an unbelievable camaraderie and yet in some cases we have nothing in common
4383711 there is an element of venting but also if you thought you were alone you were wrong
4383712 if this party turns its back on bill clinton its not a party that deserves our loyalty
4383713 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
4383714 hi everybody i hope that the denver convention will be turned into the american equivalent of tiananmen square
4383715 i started saying this was more than my candidate versus your candidate
4383716 if this guy wins that style of campaigning will become the de facto method
4383717 this evening at a thank you hillraisers event senator clinton told me how honored she is by the people who are working to have her name put into nomination and appreciative of those signing the petition
4383718 i really believe she will be the nominee i wouldnt be doing this if i didnt
4383719 i saw a georgian soldier throw a grenade into a basement full of women and children
4383720 her legs are epic long and stretching out from here to forever
4383721 our thanks to taylor momsen and ali lohan for making 14 the new 35
4383722 its funny because i forget that i look the same you know that i look the same all the time
4383723 i have two different modes i have my on set mode and then i have my mode with my friends and family my taylor mode and when im in my taylor mode i forget that people still see me as jenny it takes a minute
4383724 with jenny theres that sense of a very intelligent observant young girl looking around and going you know im not as rich as these girls and i dont have that leg up because of my family but im just as pretty and i think that im smarter
4383725 so if i play my cards right i can win this game
4383726 we wanted a character that in this journey of trying to fit in at school might actually succeed in her goal and even triumph over the other girls at some point
4383727 jenny has put high school to the side and focuses on her career trying to be a fashion designer and to fulfill her goals of world domination
4383728 they take up most of my body and im not used to coordinating them
4383729 i had the opportunity to say no but i love it ive grown up in it its kind of all i know
4383730 she really had that great quality on the one hand being cindy lou who really sweet and just sort of delightful and smiley and funny and she can act her age but she also has that gus van sant side to her very grown up very self aware
4383731 there is an intelligent watchful darkness that shes got as well those two qualities flickering back and forth between the sweet and the innocent and the more intelligent observer felt like that was really something that could be something magical for the role
4383732 dun rea i va primi n perioada urm toare drepturile pe care le are de a se constitui ntr o important arter de transport pentru europa va fi calea prin care marea nordului i marea neagr vor fi legate i vor comunica
4383733 im doing this so i can help feed the starving children
4383734 i think its great taking something and making it easy to eat and having all the vitamins in there
4383735 randolph made statements that he would be back to kill our victim
4383736 i still have a great passion for the game of football
4383737 i still very much love it in my heart i still feel like i can compete at a pro bowl level but the situation is going to have to be right im not going to just play for any team or any situation
4383738 what is travel health insurance and how we get this when we go to usa
4383739 if paris hilton thinks my butt looks gross i dont really care at least i have a butt
4383740 its just been an amazing experience that i was not prepared for but now feels completely normal to me
4383741 i was too old to carry a baby if you want the truth
4383742 we were exploring adoption or surrogacy and we kind of left it up to whatever happened quicker and the surrogacy process was a lot easier than we thought
4383743 they do nefarious things but theyre also protectors of their community which the citizens of that town are all in favor of
4383744 my character would go to extreme lengths to protect and honor and be loyal to her family
4383745 i have always thought that every telethon i do is one inch closer to a cure
4383746 my kids get a shot at a dream it never changes the intensity of emotion
4383747 i look at the world through a very important place through humor so some of the atrocities we have to live with arent as bad
4383748 the president was writing checks to the georgians without knowing what he had in the bank

4383754 when i first went down there we werent that famous as the boosh and they were all very kind to us and very nice
4383755 we had lots of fun and as we got a bit more famous they never hit on me for anything and i always had a good time down there
4383756 ihnen geht es den umst nden entsprechen gut die bundesregierung ist ber ihre freilassung sehr erleichtert
4383757 dude you didnt even say anything to her she was really liking you
4383758 wash my hands these burning hands ill open my mouth and ill sing
4383759 up to 4 hours 4gb or up to 8 hours 8gb of video
4383760 because the increase is small its awfully hard to come up with an interpretation
4383761 were pleased because the targets increased in math and reading
4383762 clearly we need to do more to improve the high school experience and ensure those students stay engaged and challenged through graduation
4383763 we are happy by the increase in ayp scores but we are aware that we have not progressed to where we should be theres a new sense of urgency and we want to move forward to increase the number of ayp schools
4383764 were really pleased that mayor nutter adopted a lot of dags reform agenda and this appointment caps it off
4383765 but what the planning commission needs right now is not someone with technical expertise but someone with leadership ability who can rally people around a new vision
4383766 i do feel quite sincerely that this is one of those 50 year seminal moments in history of philadelphia and not just another change of administration
4383767 hes someone who understands philadelphias great planning tradition and is inspired to bring the city back to that level
4383768 hes entrepreneurial he has management experience teaching experience at penn its a home run
4383769 devono cedere gli attributi alla chirurgia per la tranquillit di tutti

4383772 this act would ultimately clear the way for darla lavalle to pay herself as she saw fit
4383773 it is a political event but it is also a national event that has an impact on the city of philadelphia i mean im going to work
4383774 he has tried to present himself as a guy who took taxpayer dollars very seriously and would only use them in the proper way
4383775 theres no reason why hes got to turn to taxpayer dollars to bring his pals to the convention
4383776 the rest of us will be there performing our duties
4383777 a companys job is to make money and when they stop making money they unload
4383778 nobody is feeling sorry for the owners of the bridge
4383779 cape may county is the sixth most vulnerable place in the country for storms like hurricanes or noreasters
4383780 well probably change the toll to one way and increase it to 1
4383781 ive always believed elected officials should be seen and this is a great way to
4383782 its the place to be seen you come to see old friends and meet new friends
4383783 i wouldnt slam an outhouse door as hard as they slam people in this general assembly
4383784 i couldnt hit a bull in the ass with a banjo
4383785 i wish i were born as smart as you instead of better looking
4383786 he doesnt mince words he says the things that many of us in politics would love to be able to say
4383787 bud is one of the last of the old time politicians who knows how to have fun
4383788 i dont think its homage but id like to think some people are a little grateful
4383789 as ambassador to nato i will receive thousands of visitors per year at my residence
4383790 in addition to being an honor and great advertisement for hatboro itself the quilt would speak to all our visitors about our country our history our pride our diversity and the fact that america is a nation built on the hope and hard work of good people in towns small and large
4383791 i have nothing against kurt i watched him grow up and hes a very talented man
4383792 it just shows a nice side of america and starts a different conversation about what america is like
4383793 its not what people traditionally think of its not an andrew wyeth painting but its a piece of folk art and it shows things about real people
4383794 weve made it very clear in a situation in which russia is involved militarily in the sovereign territory of a neighbor there cant be business as usual with russia
4383795 we started this investigation in march and we found that each of these three bars had illegal slot machines and these bars were owned by these two brothers
4383796 they had these machines inside their bars which were then manipulated with metering devices and knock off devices
4383797 been comped hotel rooms meals astronomical bar tabs ski passes paragliding classes and scuba diving trips
4383798 in order to distill the chaos of life down to a clear narrative
4383799 it was necessary to omit certain events rearrange and compress chronology and combine a few of the characters i have changed most of the names and identifying details of the characters in this book to protect their privacy much of the dialogue and many e mails have been re created but all are based on real conversations and correspondence
4383800 u nderneath the self promoting veneer of the guidebook industry all kinds of things go wrong
4383801 up to now no one has given voice to the everyday life of the gritty miners of travel information those who dig up the material that is then polished and sold to consumers as travel gospel
4383802 maybe if people see what arbitrary bull goes into the making of a guidebook they will realize that its just a loose tool to give basic information
4383803 mein lieber prinz kannst du mir helfen wenn ja so sei meine h bsche tochter dein
4383804 nimm dieses damit kannst du bewirken dass die verklemmten steuermechanismen in den autos wieder funktionieren dann kannst du deine m nner und frauen wieder n tzlichen arbeiten nachgehen lassen
4383805 when you walk in the front door and check in you can expect to have pretty much the same experience that people had when they gathered here for a vacation 140 years ago
4383806 when people are booking reservations these are things they ask for
4383807 i dont think these are requests we can ignore but i think we can make these additions without changing the character the ambience of the hotel
4383808 if we were to go in and add insulation and everything else that goes with adding a heating system we would completely change the soul the character of the old building
4383809 preservation of this 132 year old marvel of a building is an ongoing process
4383810 we fell in love with her so many years ago and are delighted her welfare will continue with bob mullocks leadership
4383811 people come to cape may for the history of the town and the people who choose to stay here understand that where they are staying is as important as the destination
4383812 create an authentic experience here that has nothing to do with the outside world and theyre doing that in a very organic way that isnt contrived
4383813 people always say they feel like theyre coming home when they come here to stay
4383814 that everything was according to code to the absolute centimeter
4383815 he is clean and follows our codes to a t
4383816 were trying to arrange all the assistance that people need in this level of disaster
4383817 negligently allowed criminals and trespassers to wander about its property seeking to cause harm to its students
4383818 we will literally go right back into contract negotiations in another month or so
4383819 so you dont have to get everything you might want in a one year deal when you know youre going right back for a multiyear deal
4383820 while we do not embrace this contract we accept this contract as a way to break the stalemate
4383821 we are realistic we are recognizing the citys position financially i do think people will be disappointed
4383822 i believe we now have the critical momentum to find a new way of providing high quality care at the lowest possible cost
4383823 they bought time and they paid somewhat of a premium for it
4383824 the issue now is will the time be well spent and provide results that benefit the city the union and the taxpayers
4383825 we are pleased overall but there is much more work to do
4383826 to bring students to grade level as many low income and minority students still lag behind academically
4383827 we did a good bit of revision in instruction looking at reinforcement of basic skills
4383828 at the current pace without significant intervention it would take 40 years for all of our 11th graders to meet state standards
4383829 provide a rigorous curriculum regardless of where the student lives
4383830 not good enough not fast enough far far too many kids are not getting the quality of education they need
4383831 there is no place for complacency here yet that is what we find everywhere
4383832 they have responded very well they have taken greater ownership over their own education thats really exciting
4383833 were doing a great job and we will continue to get better
4383834 we say each individual child has to be accounted for and when a child is not getting it we say what are we going to do about it
4383835 we have nowhere to live we have no clothes at all
4383836 last time they had a moving van now they dont even have a duffel bag
4383837 we are a small community and our hearts reach out to everybody whos been affected
4383838 i feel like i should be angry but im just glad to be alive and im glad to have my cat itll probably hit me later
4383839 its amazing how the american red cross the fire department and the police department seized the moment

4383909 middle ear infection is a common childhood disease and obesity is a growing problem worldwide any potential association between these two public health issues is of considerable interest
4383910 this suggests that taste damage from ear infections may alter food choice and thus lead to obesity risk
4383911 this data suggests that there are lingering effects of tonsillectomies on taste nerves and that can affect eating habits

4383916 this is an important agreement for the security of the united states for the security of poland and the security of our nato allies
4383917 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it
4383918 in reality this project has no relation to the iranian missile threat but is aimed against russia
4383919 these installations only worsen the situation we will be forced to respond to this adequately the
4383920 we do take very seriously the concerns of our ally
4383921 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4383922 in five seven or 10 years we want to be sufficiently well equipped and well trained to be ready both with our allies but by ourselves to defend ourselves at a critical moment
4383923 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party
4383924 a new element to take our security agreement to a new level
4383925 i have no indication that russias invasion of georgia at all influenced the negotiations but who knows you can draw your own conclusions
4383926 however the european missile defense is not aimed at countering russias missile arsenal but rather at emerging threats such as iran

4383934 the identification of rheb as a gene involved in the pathogenesis of cancer opens new avenues for the development of anti cancer therapies as rheb is an inherently druggable target indeed we are already testing such drugs alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutics in faithful animal models
4383935 the key clinical implication is that rheb levels in tumor tissue could indicate patients that will benefit from relatively non toxic therapies with targeted drugs like rapamyicn or inhibitors of the farnesyltransferase enzyme
4383936 president musharraf is being forced out by a ruling coalition government which includes parties such as the ppp and the pml n these parties have been sworn enemies in pakistan and have come together only for the cause of opposing musharraf

4383951 the figure of 41 officially reported british rape victims so far is the worst ever in greek police records

4383966 people who were highly anxious had raised wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4383967 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
4383968 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
4383969 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
4383970 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4383971 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such case

4383973 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far

4383976 this study suggests that high school is a period of special challenge to chinese adolescents because of the competitive academic pressures they face high school is a time when many chinese adolescents experience intense pressures from parents to perform well in school

4383978 there is no other variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine ecosystems that has changed so drastically over such a short time as dissolved oxygen
4383979 geologic evidence shows that dead zones were not a naturally recurring event in chesapeake bay or most other estuarine ecosystems

4383992 at lower iso settings detail is truly superb the w300s lowest setting is 64 iso and although we captured most images at iso 100 the most practical option in our view there was virtually no noise present at iso settings between 800 and 3200 noise becomes more evident but we feel these images are still perfectly useable as the grain at the higher iso settings is reminiscent of conventional film images it could even be considered quite artistic in certain image situations we did not try any noise reduction but application of this in camera will provide two levels of reducing the grain even further should you desire

4384001 it is with great sadness that i have to announce that my husband and i have separated last night wednesday august 13 2008 an attempt was made by and on behalf of my husband to first prevent my entry into our home and then later to make me leave our home by force it was necessary for me to receive medical treatment for injuries suffered and in relation to those injuries i shall continue to assist the police force with its enquiries whilst it is my sincere wish to avoid unnecessary conflict i shall not be intimidated nor shall those individuals whose job it is to protect and represent me i ask that my privacy be respected in these difficult times and i believe that the people of the tci will understand and support my wish to receive the necessary independent representation from the legal counsel of my choosing i hope that in time the tci government will come to share that view although i have always been a supportive wife even in light of the very serious allegations currently pending against the premier there are limits even for me i continue to have the utmost respect for the people of the tci who have always shown me kindness and support i vow to continue my work amongst the people of turks and caicos islands until recently i had hoped that i would be able to continue to assist my husband during what will undoubtedly be difficult times ahead for him i do not wish to have to add to his difficulties

4384004 this new brain research together with the nrcs evidence of fluorides thyroid and bone damage and the cdcs recommendation against use of fluoridated water in infant formula as well as the national kidney foundations withdrawal of their fluoridation support makes a strong case for ending this 60 year old fluoridation experiment
4384005 there have now been over 40 animal studies which show that fluoride can damage the brain and no less than 18 studies which show that fluoride lowers iq in children and only 2 that dont
4384006 its apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain
4384007 the weight of evidence thats on the table now says that on a precautionary basis we should stop this practice fluoridation
4384008 the canadian dental association says there is no evidence to support the claims that fluoride in drinking water can lead to lower iqs
4384009 the majority of dental professionals surveyed were unaware of the current understanding of fluorides predominant posteruptive mode of action
4384010 no child is or ever was fluoride deficient in fact the u s centers for disease control tells us that 1 3 of u s school children are fluoride overdosed causing dental fluorosis white spotted yellow brown and or pitted teeth its time to stop fluoridation

4384029 management is pleased with the second quarter results in spite of challenging conditions in some of our manufacturing subsidiaries we were able to hit new quarterly milestones in a number of areas but most importantly in profit and distributable cash our aviation segment showed strong organic growth and the completion of the rationalization of the fleet of aircraft is evident in the results fully diluted distributable cash per unit grew by 8 over the preceding year to 0 67 per unit this is particularly impressive when you take into account that the second quarter of 2007 was a strong period for the fund and that we faced very high fuel prices and a weakening economy in 2008
4384030 the benefits of a diversified portfolio are evident in our quarterly results
4384031 while we are happy with the overall results we still see opportunities for improvement our manufacturing segment has room to improve as the weaker economy as well as internal issues at jasper tank have resulted in the manufacturing segment falling short of its potential in the second quarter our aviation investments performed very well and enabled us to reach record profit levels in spite of the challenges we faced in manufacturing we believe more strongly than ever that diversification can be a valuable tool in achieving dependable growing distributions for our unitholders the key to our success is discipline and being willing to say no if a transaction is not accretive to our unitholders
4384032 market conditions continue to be extremely difficult and timberwest is therefore staying the course with its harvest deferral strategy
4384033 we continue to work on resolving this issue and by the end of the third quarter expect to either amend the existing facilities or put new ones in place
4384034 we had a strong second quarter with consolidated same store sales growth of nearly seven percent and quarterly pooled revenue exceeding 45 million for the first time our growth is being driven by both the new royalty pooled restaurants and our long established locations both in our concept and signature groups we believe this reflects the underlying strength of our diverse portfolio of restaurant brands
4384035 since the sir royalty income fund completed its initial public offering late in 2004 we focused on investing in our existing restaurants first enhancing our brands through renovations menu alterations and other initiatives and then we expanded building on a stronger foundation supported by our diverse and popular restaurant brands we are now reaping the rewards of our measured customer focused approach as we grow our business
4384036 we continue to elevate the profile of our flagship jack astors brand with new restaurant openings in high traffic downtown toronto locations such as the corner of yonge and dundas streets and more recently with the conversion of our former brasserie frisco location in torontos entertainment district into a jack astors
4384037 we expect to open a new jack astors at the intersection of yonge and bloor streets later this year other future restaurant sites which have been announced include a new jack astors in don mills ontario and boisbriand quebec just north of montreal a new canyon creek in brampton ontario and two new locations at the corner of yonge and gerrard streets in downtown toronto

4384050 our announced strategic partnership with roche diagnostics the largest in vitro diagnostics company in the world to commercialize our cardiovascular tests and new ramp 200 reader solidifies our commercialization strategy coupled with our partnerships with 3m and shionogi we believe we are poised for rapid market expansion of our ramp platform
4384051 the key to roches marketing launch for the cardiovascular line of products was for us to receive the u s fda clearance of the nt probnp assay for the diagnosis of heart failure subsequent to the end of the second quarter we received this clearance paving the way for an expected launch of the cardiovascular product line on the new ramp 200 analyzer in the first quarter of 2009
4384052 roche is very focused on training their extensive sales force and we are preparing for the manufacture of the large number of co branded readers and test kits to support that launch the global poc cardiac market is expanding dramatically and roche will be putting the resources in place to take advantage of this opportunity

4384056 we have been engaging current and prospective partners along the lines of a more sustainable and profitable business model for the company as a result discussions have been more extensive and more time consuming but the new business perspective remains positive our principal focus for the balance of 2008 is to continue to develop additional revenue streams both through deeper market penetration of the properties in which we operate and through the addition of new top tier sports properties

4384064 its very difficult when one of us is competing to keep your mind on your own game
4384065 the past few days have been a roller coaster ride for both of us
4384066 i like roller coasters with katie winning two medals weve had a lot of things to do
4384067 i cant hide under the radar any more when number ones in the world lose its always in the headlines it looks a little more extreme
4384068 its just not so easy to keep it up all the time eventually sometimes they get you
4384069 look at adrian peterson he was a rookie last year and he was explosive
4384070 when i came back people up here told me you need the utep swagger back and you need to walk around with your head up high and look at someone and say i know you cant tackle me
4384071 when im out there now i feel like i have my swagger back and im very confident in everything i do
4384072 everything is not new to him you could tell this offseason we started talking about it right at the beginning of our ota days that he looked different he just looks confident and he is stronger and bigger so that helps him as well
4384073 he looked great on the two punt returns last week and hopefully he can do it on kickoff returns as well
4384074 youre just trying to learn whats going on and where to be at
4384075 its a little frustrating but its what you go through when you first start out everybody can relate to that
4384076 when i first came it was more wow we have to know this we have to remember this we have to remember to do that
4384077 now its more what was this on this play as opposed to not knowing anything
4384078 my biggest thing is always knowing where you need to be knowing whats going on
4384079 from there you can get the job accomplished its not necessarily easy to go out there and play hard but if you go out there and not know what youre doing you may accidentally make a couple of plays you may accidentally give up some plays more likely youll give up more than you make my thing is if i know what im doing know where im supposed to be hopefully i wont give up too many at all
4384080 it was a little rough i was a little nervous wasnt sure of plays
4384081 now i had a chance to get into the playbook a little bit more i obviously got that first experience out of the way so hopefully i will be a little more comfortable out there
4384082 theres been some times where you see the pass rush ability the raw power
4384083 hes got very strong hands hes got a great ability to control the line of scrimmage and those traits just naturally come out especially in a one on one drill or something where its less processing but you want to see it translate into the game and into the practices it will come
4384084 i started out late but thats something i couldnt control
4384085 once i got here i was focused on what im doing doing some extra meetings doing some extra things on the field and im getting up to speed
4384086 i think the longer he goes and the more comfortable he gets with the system i think hes going to be fine
4384087 we think hes going to be a good football player and hes shown at different times that he can help us we just need to keep trying to speed up his indoctrination hes worked hard at it hes spent a lot of time after practice both on the field and in the classroom to try to catch up
4384088 im still chasing him i have three more finals to beat him
4384089 i saw it every single day and that gave me the extra motivation that made a little bit of a difference just having it and being able to see it in my room

4384101 i may have sent him over there but on the other hand i may not have i dont have an accurate recollection
4384102 the only thing it could do was to hurt and publicly humiliate elizabeth edwards and her two young children and i think youll agree that that family has enough on its plate as it is the only people clamoring for this to go public were heartless vicious assholes like kaus

4384626 in a seven hour span friday detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick endured a surreal journey that found him pleading to get out of jail in the morning facing a pair of new felony charges shortly afterward standing glumly for an eerie video arraignment in the afternoon and finally arriving back at city hall wearing jeans a dress shirt and electronic tether
4384627 the mayor is simply less intimidating today with a tether around his ankle than he was in 2002 or 2003 when he was firing cops who disagreed with him
4384628 others were more explicit about how they thought the distraction should be brought to an end several area leaders made or renewed calls for kilpatrick to either resign or be removed from office some did so quietly while others made public statements
4384629 its going to be broadcast all around the world and its one more blow that the city of detroit should not have to take and for that matter it involves in a negative way the image of the entire region
4384630 i always felt that united would do it last year but i fancy chelsea this time
4384631 theres no african cup of nations in january theyve got a new manager theyve bought one or two players and for all the ups and downs last year they still nearly nicked it

4384647 it is impossible to have such kind of negotiations with the person who started actions against the innocent
4384648 i knew that i had to go out there and do a normal routine
4384649 that is what my dad kept saying dont do anything better than you know how to do it
4384650 it makes it so sweet knowing that ive been through so much with injuries and doubters
4384651 but it made me stronger and made me the person i am today its been a long journey but its been worth it
4384652 we have worked so hard for this and it finally paid off
4384653 shes a tiger inside i did strongly believe that it would pay off and it did pay off in a big way
4384654 i gave my heart and soul to the competition today nastia has been around awhile she has a lot of experienced and she deserved the gold today
4384655 the event has progressed quite a bit in the past several years
4384656 im very happy with my time its my best time its my 11th swim of the meet im worn down but im happy
4384657 i just wanted to go out and give it my all and i did that
4384658 im so happy to get the silver it was an amazing race she steffen fought hard i fought hard its the olympics its what you have to do to get there theres no way i could be disappointed
4384659 i dont want to complain im sure my competitors are very tired too theres so much that goes into each and every swim its not just the swim its the warm up the warm down press conferences drug testing
4384660 i have one more race in the medley relay and im very glad i have a day off to rest i think well have a very good relay
4384661 it was kind of cool to sit back there and watch all that happen
4384662 the less of the technology you actually see the better
4384663 the sabre is now the weapon that gets the most television coverage and tv likes it
4384664 needless to say that created highly subjective judging to put it nicely
4384665 there was a perception or a reality that european countries would get the benefit of the doubt
4384666 it is proprietary so they wont tell anybody details of how it works
4384667 we must be a leader in ensuring the health and integrity of horses and of this vitally important industry
4384668 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities
4384669 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4384670 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4384671 that is the feeling i have been looking for and it feels very good
4384672 i said to him for todays competition just let it go
4384673 i was in very good shape back then if i couldnt win a gold then i thought i could never get a gold extra training would not have had an effect
4384674 one thing we talk a lot about is its not how you start its how you finish
4384675 they know they can come back they know theres no reason to quit
4384676 tom hoff was saying how ironic it is that hugh is always preparing them for injuries and distractions and all of a sudden its him thats had this tragedy with his family
4384677 thats the great job hes done in empowering them hes such a good leader this whole thing works even without him
4384678 its beating teams that we once thought were unbeatable were climbing up that ladder
4384679 weve gotten better at trusting each other playing defense and not quitting before we would have panicked now were composed and handling things better
4384680 they want to win a gold medal and they can win a gold medal
4384681 even though the tragedy has been an inspiration they didnt need an inspiration in their minds they want to win it for hugh and they want to win it for themselves
4384682 well the name of the game in the semis is to make the final
4384683 mission accomplished im excited to have an outside lane therell be an open lane outside of me i wont have to deal with as many waves it will be fierce tonight the fewer waves the better
4384684 without question you can swim faster out there for sure
4384685 i imagined my best time and put that on a piece of paper
4384686 im not looking for excuses but we werent fencing up to our potential
4384687 after missing the first couple it seemed like i kept forcing it
4384688 it was totally in my head not taking the time to relax and put it where i needed to put it
4384689 ive been going through a stretch where i was scuffling
4384690 thats just part of a long season making 33 34 starts not all of them are going to go great i worked on a few things in the bullpen got myself right and just felt a lot better out there
4384691 despite being a model student athlete and person for the ncaa and despite having earned the ncaa significant revenues the ncaa has wrongfully arbitrarily and capriciously denied mr mauks request to participate in a fourth year of athletic competition for reasons completely beyond mr mauks control
4384692 were really fortunate to get someone that has accomplished some very good things at the division i level in his freshman year at manhattan
4384693 they were pretty solid as far as running the show
4384694 there were a couple of things as far as mechanics are concerned that need some work both of them missed some balls that you hope they would complete but mostly they were good
4384695 wed like someone to establish himself in the next couple of weeks if not well make a decision on whos going to take the first snaps im not a big fan of the two quarterback system usually so it would be nice if someone separated himself
4384696 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control and it would ratify their continuing engagement with the military force until everything is worked out but it doesnt say that the forces will be replaced
4384697 the russians dont need much justification to do pretty much what they want theyve shown that theyve got a free hand here anyway but any legal justification that can help will always be used
4384698 they russians are taking fuller control of the region and creating a situation where they get the georgians out so they get little leverage on which to negotiate the future status of the regions
4384699 anything allowing russia to be in gori is clearly not useful or acceptable for georgians
4384700 georgians do have an interest in provocation and need to be kept under control
4384701 because the incentive for the georgians is to have the russians do nasty things which will then help their bargaining with the outside world
4384702 i stick my big nose in when i go out sealed off car park whats it all about
4384703 it is only when the threat of popular participation is overcome that democratic forms can be safely contemplated
4384704 never have the well worn tactics of democracy promotion been applied with more devastating effect than in haiti between 2000 and 2004
4384705 was the declaration of human freedom universally consistent only in haiti was this declaration sustained at all costs in direct opposition to the social order and economic logic of the day
4384706 there is no single event in the whole of modern history whose implications were more threatening to the dominant global order of things
4384707 somewhere somehow theres a little secret satisfaction perhaps an unconscious satisfaction in saying things that powerful white people want you to say
4384708 when to use p re lebrun and where to use it
4384709 you may never use it again in a state where law prevails
4384710 the very word says it all chim res are people who are impoverished who live in a state of profound insecurity and chronic unemployment they are the victims of structural injustice of systematic social violence its not surprising that they should confront those who have always benefited from this same social violence
4384711 it is better to be wrong with the people than to be right against the people
4384712 theyre mechanical the smoke is a trick strike down the middle of the things
4384713 check called flopped trips with min re raise on turn
4384714 called a raise in pos with 9ts called with str8 drw on flop
4384715 i would see this as very on line with what forster recommended
4384716 he recommended a flatter structure greater performance greater accountability increased transparency and ensuring that the majority of our 8 5 billion budget is directed at clinical services
4384717 this will allow larger and better resourced districts to deliver local health services and important hospital building programs
4384718 more than anything people are saying to me there is confusion and some lack of clarity which can be rectified and there needs to be a decision as to where the accountabilities lie
4384719 waiting lists have continued to grow and not enough new beds have been delivered despite numerous promises rhetoric and now more restructuring
4384720 the health minister and his new director general should stop wasting time and tinkering at the edges of the departments organisational structure

4384753 sadly again in the last few days there have been a number of suspected heroin overdoses
4384754 to our knowledge there have been eight since august 10 and sadly four of those persons did not recover and died as a result

4384758 voor een jongerencentrum is weinig ruimte in de stad de gemeente wil ons niet hebben in de buurt van een school tankstation of bejaardentehuis

4384770 while im not going to comment about those specific allegations its my view that anyone who is illegally involved in diverting water in the murray darling system during this crisis is engaging in an act of terrorism against the people of australia
4384771 it is a criminal offence and anyone siphoning water off illegally in my view should be locked up rather than the fines that i am told are currently in place
4384772 anyone who is doing this sort of thing is unbelievably treacherous to the national interest and its an act of terrorism against the australian people

4384800 when the idea was forming about ten months ago we didnt plan to gather the best blogs on everything from archeology to beekeeping to celeb gossip and we certainly didnt plan to have built in audio and video players twitter and facebook sharing or the level of social interaction we ended up with scott was working in real estate not in an i want to sell you a house kind of capacity but in a i want to use technology to improve the industry sort of way and noticed there was no site where he could go to see the best real estate blog posts without all the rubbish he decided to build one and call it regator meanwhile chris was learning php for a billiards video game he was working on he was discovering that he could do all sorts of nifty stuff pretty easily with the new language and after talking with scott about regator he spent a couple weeks teaching himself mysql and ajax so he could start building the site it wasnt long before it moved beyond scotts initial real estate focus when kimberly who is a magazine editor and therefore used to being picky about writing and content was asked to select a few blogs for the site the team was complete and the idea has been evolving ever since regators three founders live together in a little green house in georgia the u s state not the nation and our constant access to one another for brainstorming probably caused it to go in directions that it might not have otherwise gone

4384869 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4384870 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core

4384999 anyone who is doing this sort of thing is unbelievably treacherous to the national interest and its an act of terrorism against the australian people

4385032 i truly believe that the majority of youth are good kids but there are some that are perhaps not as focused as they should be and they look to things like this to impress their friends
4385033 we have been able to collect licence plate numbers of cars involved in the act and will report anyone or any vehicle seen stealing flags to the police
4385034 so we thought lets get off our backsides and actually do something
4385035 when i grab a flag cars stop much more frequently
4385036 twenty of the drug dealers have for all intents and purposes been dealing on a single street in cape breton
4385037 i think some people will be shocked and others will be alarmed when they hear about this but i think it also speaks to other issues and concerns that are much bigger enforcement is required but its just one piece of the puzzle
4385038 there was a growing increase in prescriptive pill abuse and drug dealing
4385039 in terms of a police investigation it can be very difficult because somebodys got a prescription thats legal having it on them is not an offence but selling is
4385040 we were seeing crimes that we know could be directly linked to drugs
4385041 everything from arsons break and enters thefts and stolen goods we know that all of these areas are tied together in some form
4385042 there are so many poor little kids around here hooked they say glace bay has got more drugs than halifax
4385043 its become just like giving somebody a sandwich or an apple
4385044 i would see this as very on line with what forster recommended
4385045 he recommended a flatter structure greater performance greater accountability increased transparency and ensuring that the majority of our 8 5 billion budget is directed at clinical services
4385046 this will allow larger and better resourced districts to deliver local health services and important hospital building programs
4385047 more than anything people are saying to me there is confusion and some lack of clarity which can be rectified and there needs to be a decision as to where the accountabilities lie
4385048 waiting lists have continued to grow and not enough new beds have been delivered despite numerous promises rhetoric and now more restructuring
4385049 since bush our zero deficit from the clinton years climbed to some trillion dollars
4385050 theres no farm labour pool anymore to help find people interested in that kind of work
4385051 young people are brought up now that theyre not used to doing that kind of work
4385052 theyre a couple of generations away from the farm its an increasing problem
4385053 this is a very tangible support for people with breast cancer
4385054 once you get it once you live with it for the rest of your life thinking gee i wonder if when i wake up this morning i might have a problem
4385055 while the comparisons against us were softer than of late that in no way detracted from the strength of the performancegiven the extremely challenging trading conditions we are in
4385056 many branches commented on the effect of unsettled weatherlast week which clearly drove footfall into our shops comparedto a year ago
4385057 global demand in the latter half of 2009 is expected to touch 89 million barrels per day compared to 85 million barrels per day at the end of 2007
4385058 at the present stage there is merit in the contention that the article put up by the defendant on the blog site is defamatory
4385059 we are planning to have either an ipo if the situation onfinancial markets improves and we dont rule out some kind ofstrategic partner
4385060 the 28 youngsters under 45 collectively enjoyed a 5 9 per cent increase in overall compensation
4385061 though it takes a lot of time to learn a business inside and out earn the respect of the board and perhaps the hardest of all win the hearts of employees
4385062 you almost died your car was basically a moving bomb
4385063 its a century home thats been beautifully restored recently by a renowned builder in the area who owns and lives there
4385064 hes has done a lot of restoration work in rosedale and forest hill
4385065 the key thing is keeping everything as original as possible
4385066 youve got the original banisters there that have been fixed and restored original baseboards trims doors and framework
4385067 its beautifully landscaped larger than others and backs on to a ravine
4385068 the buyer would be somebody whos really interested in the history of a property like this and wants that ravine type lot
4385069 the land was rolling with good drainage and loam plus it was in crop
4385070 like the holstein cattle the thomsens had when i bought it in 1989
4385071 its always an advantage to buy land where cattle have been living
4385072 my place has pure clean water from a well that was once run by a windmill
4385073 you have these nice plump birds in your freezer when you need them
4385074 i was approached by local farmers who knew i was not using all the buildings and the land
4385075 renting your farmland is a good way to maintain it otherwise it will eventually go to weeds and revert in time to scrub when i saw the hay growing i knew i could have income from my land
4385076 over 50 per cent of the buyers live work or have family in the area
4385077 you dont have to be an economist to predict that prices will go down in saskatoon and regina but in terms of the fundamentals all the pieces there are still fine a healthy economy energy boom and rising food prices
4385078 other than people who bought last year thinking prices would keep doubling over breakfast most people there western canada should still end up ahead
4385079 the concern here is that the potential decline in ontario would not reflect overshooting but instead the further slowing of an economy that is probably already in recession
4385080 while i would expect a more modest drop in prices of about 5 per cent in ontario and the gta prices have not risen as much here and the decline would be more painful
4385081 its pretty unique given its location in collingwood on a former harbour so a lot of the units will have water frontage
4385082 but even if youre not facing the water directly youre all part of the same waterfront community
4385083 for over 100 years the shipyards were a physical barrier separating the heart of the community from its waterfront
4385084 access to this vital public space will be restored to the people of collingwood
4385085 we have one of the premier sites in the georgian triangle
4385086 a lot of purchasers have had a chalet or cottage in the area so theyre very familiar with collingwood
4385087 over 60 per cent of residents live there year round and 40 per cent use it as a second home
4385088 each time you turn on a water faucet use the lowest pressure necessary keep the water turned on only while it is needed
4385089 nova scotia carriers many carriers have been both acquiring these vehicles as well as planning to acquire these vehicles
4385090 in the last school term we reviewed our policies we suspended the use of the 15 seaters and we were looking for an alternative
4385091 weve been working with one of the bus companies to see if we cant lease one of those vehicles thats just come off the line
4385092 seeing non conforming vehicles being increasingly used for the transportation of students
4385093 a safer alternative to vehicles not classified as a school bus but which are still used to transport groups of school aged passengers to sporting events community activities or other such educational or child care facilities and outings
4385094 not just in the school industry but in other areas
4385095 theyve gone out on what we call the walk alongs to see what the patrol is like
4385096 its an opportunity for me to continue to work in the community
4385097 thats what ive been doing for the past seven years here in halifax and now im ready to bring that work and that advocacy to another arena
4385098 its funny to watch it but in reality thats not the kind of life we live
4385099 they pretty much think drinking drunk dont do good in school
4385100 they say you dont get drunk in your house what do you do
4385101 they build leadership skills theres tons of community service theres social opportunities and the brotherhood the friends that you make i couldnt say no to joining
4385102 there were holes in the living room you could crawl through the wall and come up to the second floor
4385103 he pretty much said he had the right to fine us because of what people used to do before we went alcohol free
4385104 none of them come close to the movie version of it
4385105 there are some fraternities we work very closely with whenever theyre having an event they call and let us know they hire their own security and make sure they do everything above board
4385106 with our principles it should be that when a girl comes over the frat house it should be one of the safest place she should feel
4385107 the way he was in the movie is the way he pretty much lived his life and it killed him
4385108 vor dem rennen hat mein trainer norbert warnatzsch gesagt dass ich keine experimente machen und die ruhe bewahren soll

4385120 i think when i have grandkids all the games will be on video and theyll be able to see it for themselves
4385121 theyll see it was a line drive off the wall
4385122 i was in the bullpen and i wasnt having any trouble at all keeping the ball down
4385123 but the oakland seventh was a long inning they the rays had made a pitching change and somewhere between the bullpen and the mound i lost my release point
4385124 i thought that was going to hit off the wall
4385125 that one i thought was out i thought it was going to hit off the top of the scoreboard
4385126 i could have gone scoreless the whole year long and not won the cy young award
4385127 as long as im not remembered just for those first 39 innings ill be ok with that
4385128 the only other stretch i can remember was in 2005 early in the season but i think this is probably a little bit worse its not a lot of fun
4385129 im not trying to describe games right now to be honest with you just
4385130 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4385131 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems

4385136 members who should have been shipped a dvd today will automatically receive a credit to their
4385137 we took the plunge to be off grid and heat the house from earth sheltering
4385138 you have to learn how much electricity you can use
4385139 we have to be careful how much we use and know how much everything uses
4385140 i cant stand the waste of electricity in our society and am not a fan of nuclear i grew up in a time when you conserved electricity
4385141 the chance to do something off grid was a dream i had that i never thought would be possible
4385142 we are working very hard with the ministry of children and youth to make sure that whatever needs to be done will be done whatever changes need to be made will be made whatever we need to strengthen will be done to make sure that our children our most vulnerable are protected
4385143 and they dont think of any style and so you explained to them how the building would work best and how it would be the most economic way to put together and then they said okay and then it was finished and it was modern
4385144 the architecture of the modern era in peterborough has yet to be documented and evaluated
4385145 the nerve of you people to act so god damn smug
4385146 with the present climate there is not a chance in hell that we are going to reach an agreement with these folks
4385147 the reality for us this time is that we believe that we will get a fairer deal in arbitration than we will from the police services board
4385148 over the last decade it has always been recognized within bargaining that toronto officers need to be compensated to become the highest paid
4385149 no responsible employer would want to enter into such an agreement
4385150 i wouldnt say its lockstep but certainly we very much keep an eye on what is happening in the same way we do with toronto fire
4385151 the general labour relations atmosphere that we are currently under in this city it is pathetic it is commensurate with the labour relations relationship that we had pre 2002

4385185 these compact florescent lamps are much more efficient than the incandescent up to 75 percent more efficient and it lasts up to ten times longer
4385186 because they never make it to the landfill which may be a reasonably safe place for them if they reach it intact but there are so many potential avenues for breakage along the way they are fragile and mercury gets released and sanitation workers can get exposed
4385187 vacuuming is a no no because what you are doing is re entering the mercury into the atmosphere and that is something you want to stay away from

4385371 generally we played well those first two games but losses are always losses and there is always a fear that we dont recover
4385372 any time that we have yao on the floor and he is healthy and able to play we feel confident

4385383 this is the end columns of russian tanks are heading tbilisi georgians who are still alive retreat to their capital city to defend it and die the president of the dying country is still heard pleading the world to save his country and people whose only fault was to trust the west and have chosen democracy as way of life in response mr bush repeates sic he condemns russia the other western powers in order to conceal their fear keep pretending they believe the satanic russian lies about the true situation that was cooked up for the start of long planned destruction of georgia this is the end evil and lie have won the world is near its end
4385384 for georgia read czechoslovakia for south ossetia read sudentenland for russia read germany for vladimir putin read adolf hitler for 1938 read 2008
4385385 this autumn will mark the seventieth anniversary of the munich agreement when the democratic powers of western europe britain and france weakened as they were by the self hating anti war defeatism of wide sections of the western chattering classes on the left as well as of the right allowed a fascist expansionist imperial power to carve up a much smaller and weaker multinational state using the excuse that it wanted to protect the rights of its co nationals for the first time since world war ii the democratic west is faced by a brutal neo fascist expansionist regime in command of an imperial state whose military might is comparable to that of hitlers third reich
4385386 vladimir putin has dropped literally a bombshell by ordering a full scale military invasion of georgia he has revealed the true face of his autocratic rule by flying in person to the scene as if he was field commander in chief he is showing the world that russia will revert to being a military power willing to bully and threaten its neighbours
4385387 as so often with bullies the russian governments behaviour disguises deep insecurity and a craving for respect this makes it more susceptible to our opinions than we often think further aggressive steps against georgia would certainly be a reason to reconsider whether russia should continue to enjoy the prestige that comes with membership of the g8 another possible response ties in nicely with our current olympic obsession russia is due to host the winter olympics in 2014 at sochi and hopes to use the event like the chinese as an expression of its power on the world stage there would be very good grounds for asking the international olympic committee to consider whether a country that was actively working to dismember a neighbour only a few kilometres from sochi was an adequate standard bearer for the olympic ideal
4385388 you can talk about 1938 you can talk about 1914 you can even if you want to show off talk about 1811 12 what is in no doubt is that several times in the modern era the course of history has been changed by an escalation from the sort of opportunistic bullying we have seen in georgia and only a fool would say it would not be again faced with the choice of having to switch off the lights at 8pm in the winter while putting on a thicker sweater or having a nuclear holocaust i know how i would prefer the west to make its point against this aggressor
4385389 so when newfoundland finally joined together with us in confederation in 1867 we all say it was like a family reunion

4385453 i wonder if those paying homage here really understand the meaning of war
4385454 the ceaseless visits to yasukuni shrine in japan are a total negation of the japanese history of aggression and crimes

4385460 few people wrote under 100 words some people put tolstoy to shame it seems a lot of people have waited a long time to tell a game developer the answer to this question
4385461 a lot of people cited the cost of games as a major reason for pirating many were kids with no cash and lots of time to play games but many were not
4385462 although there were many and varied complaints about tech support game stability bugs and system requirements it was interesting to hear so many complaints about actual game design and gameplay
4385463 got boring too quickly were too derivative and had gameplay issues
4385464 people dont like drm we knew that but the extent to which drm is turning away people who have no other complaints is possibly misunderstood if you wanted to change one thing to get more pirates to buy games scrapping drm is it
4385465 lots of people claimed to pirate because it was easier than going to shops many of them said they pirate everything thats not on valves steam steam got a pretty universal thumbs up from everyone
4385466 ive gone from being demoralized by pirates to actually inspired by them and im working harder than ever before on making my games fun and polished

4385481 j k rowlings books had now been shifted to july 17 2009 said the decision was taken to guarantee the studio a major summer blockbuster in 2009 and was partially explained by the which paralyzed the movie industry this year
4385482 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
4385483 we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4385484 the good news for fans is that the gap will now be shortened between half blood prince and the first part of harry potter and the deathly hallows
4385485 the world will be watching to see if there is the political will to continue on with this case
4385486 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4385487 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4385488 i have personally conveyed my concern and disappointment to the
4385489 in this hour of crisis divisive politics will lead us nowhere
4385490 i appeal to all political parties to keep the long term interests of in view and come together to find a permanent solution
4385491 but in taking these steps we need to keep in mind that we do not do anything which hurts the growth rate
4385492 the nuclear agreement that we are negotiating with will end indias nuclear isolation

4385520 i just think she played the match of her life not much i could do about it
4385521 i definitely would have liked to have served better and return better i think that would have definitely helped my cause just lost my rhythm today it happens
4385522 but she really played better than the best she can play i think got to bring it out at the right times and she did
4385523 i really dont hear that much when im on the court
4385524 for me the crowd doesnt affect me a lot because whether they clap or scream it doesnt make me hit my forehand better or worse or any other shot
4385525 i think shes definitely had some nice results in her career but nothing like this especially against a player like me
4385526 i felt extremely confident going into the match at all points that i was going be the winner so its not like i even came into the match doubting that i was ever going to win
4385527 im definitely disappointed not to be able to bring home a medal in the singles
4385528 but im still in the doubles and thats equally as important in these games im super focused on that

4385537 clubs have invested well over 400 million building outdoor areas so that smokers wouldnt take their habit onto our streets
4385538 to their credit smokers have been very understanding and have been willing to exit to an outdoor area when they wish to have a cigarette
4385539 having congregations of people smoking outside on the footpath often in built up residential areas would be a nightmare for those living nearby as well as those walking on the street
4385540 common sense says large comfortable outdoor areas are the only way to control smokers and restrict their butts from ending up in our street gutters and ultimately our waterways
4385541 the national benchmark for anti smoking legislation is queensland where the government has successfully implemented a 100 per cent smoking ban in all pubs and clubs including outdoor eating and drinking areas
4385542 certainly if there is a cut the banks must pass every single cent on to those who have got home loans and the small business community
4385543 the banks have recently had the benefit of a 20 to 30 basis point cut effectively in the price they are paying for money
4385544 they could be in a position to cuts rates right now before the reserve bank moves if it chooses to do so
4385545 it seems they are not taking seriously what mr swan says and i would expect that the treasurer in fact should be meeting the ceos of the major banks and make absolutely clear to them what the australian public expects
4385546 i could not interpret that other than a deliberate intake
4385547 we need to change our mentality quickly for the premier league opener
4385548 we have a few minor injuries bruises and so on xabi alonso and yossi benayoun have got some small problems but they will be okay for the game in sunderland
4385549 we would have preferred that he did not need to play we waited and waited but in the end we needed him because we were not in control of midfield
4385550 competition for places must improve we have several away or injured we need more players to out pressure on players
4385551 i do not like to talk about specific players but clearly we were not the best we were not good in midfield or the defence
4385552 if you have more players competing for positions in the team things are better we need new players but for the moment we must work to make the ones we have got better players
4385553 now we are looking forward to saturday and the first league game at
4385554 we know in liege it was not our best game but we want to step things up and we know there is quality in the team we have shown that in pre season and now we must show it in competitive matches too

4385567 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4385568 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4385569 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4385570 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4385571 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

4385577 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4385578 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4385579 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4385580 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4385581 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4385582 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4385583 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4385584 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

4385596 there is an important qualification stage with little margin for error and we should prepare with the correct mentality
4385597 nobody in spain should be emphasising that any players have the door closed to them
4385598 ra l is a player that is in the same situation as many others he does not have the doors of the national team closed to him but we have chosen not to bring him this time

4385602 iraola is a right back that has played a lot of game for athletic and we want to have a closer look at him
4385603 bojan and capel are both boys from the under 21 side that we will believe should now step up and give the squad a fresh impetus like every national team needs occasionally

4385606 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4385607 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4385608 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4385609 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4385610 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4385611 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4385612 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4385613 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4385614 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4385615 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4385616 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4385617 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4385618 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4385619 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4385620 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4385621 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4385622 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4385623 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4385624 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4385625 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4385626 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4385627 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4385628 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4385629 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4385630 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4385631 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4385632 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4385633 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4385634 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4385635 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4385636 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4385637 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4385638 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4385639 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4385640 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4385641 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4385642 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4385643 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4385644 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4385645 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4385646 the act of placing the head of ones penis inside the foreskin of anothers penis
4385647 david and patrick enjoyed docking immensely because of pattys stretchy foreskin

4385651 i think that was the same infield i remember for a game in spring training

4385654 it aint easy you learn the hard way in this game its a lot on a kids mind itll be an interesting month and a half
4385655 its the hardest part of the game to swallow when you make your pitch and dont get the guy out
4385656 its frustrating especially because all our games are going to be close typically we dont blow guys out so those little balls that get through like that it just gets frustrating
4385657 he threw one down the middle its not what you expect in that situation the guy berkman is a great hitter he shouldnt get a pitch like that but he did

4385669 this appears to be the first example of cryptic female choice found in an externally fertilizing species
4385670 we were startled to find that female salmon are also able to exert this kind of influence previously it had been thought that once their eggs had been released females had very little say over which of the males around her would fertilize them
4385671 we found that the speed of a males sperm varied significantly according to which females ovarian fluid it was swimming in
4385672 from the females perspective it makes sense that when you only have one opportunity to reproduce in your life you want to make sure you get it right
4385673 for the males you could say that the upshot is that there may be someone for everyone in the salmon world the race does not always go to the naturally fastest runner as the conditions on the racecourse differ
4385674 drugs are of the devil and you need to have god in your life to walk away from the devil when he tempts you through your friends to use drugs be strong enough to walk away and not be persuaded
4385675 we are happy to partner with the club from the first year and this is the ninth year we are doing so they have displayed a level of discipline not only on the field but off of it as well i have had the opportunity to sit in on some of their meetings and as a club they have stuck to their plans and decisions agreed upon in those meetings
4385676 we are the first corporate entity in guyana to have sponsored a football club and i must say thanks to them for they not only made us proud on the filed with their performances and results but they also made our product the fruta brand of juices the number one selling juice here in guyana and with this in mind we are more than happy to give back to them in anyway possible
4385677 i need funding for people to do a level 2 in team leading even though they have a level 2 in health and social care

4385679 i dont think people are too keen to take positions into the weekend mr herring said
4385680 wall street provided a good lead but weve seen spot gold come off oil was a bit weaker overnight and there was a fairly sharp rally in commodity stocks yesterday
4385681 equity traders remain sceptical as overbought commodity prices tumbled through the week on slowing global growth and stronger us dollar he said
4385682 throughout our conversation he has been calm measured and disinclined to rubbish the supermarket chains
4385683 but my suggestion that big food industrial scale operators are the way ahead sends him whizzing off piste jabbing his finger at me he lets rip what all run by gigantic corporations is that really the answer i think not that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring that there is no food in the future
4385684 bouncing in his chair the prince sets out his nightmare vision a world in which millions of small farmers are driven off their land by global conglomerates into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
4385685 very important to talk to them they respond i find
4385686 few of his claims are based on data from the real world while some of the agricultural and environmental problems he highlights are clearly genuine his explanations for them are long on bombast and short on evidence
4385687 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity that has gone seriously wrong
4385688 hundreds of millions of consumers in the united states have been eating gm food for 12 years with no evidence of any health problems
4385689 gm crops have not contributed to the problem but they may help to offer a medium term solution scientists are working actively to develop new crop varieties that require less water and that grow in more saline soils using both transgenic and conventional breeding techniques

4385700 all persons interviewed highly recommended him for a position of trust and responsibility
4385701 dreyfus urged republicans to open their doors to people who had too long been excluded from party affairs women minorities urban workers and students
4385702 it certainly would have been something he might have had an interest in
4385703 if theres not continued access of humanitarian supplies if civilians are not protected if they are limited in where they can move its something that could develop into a crisis
4385704 these people are running out of places to go and basic necessities
4385705 the tigers are keeping them in harms way and the government is not doing enough to ensure they receive essential assistance
4385706 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4385707 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4385708 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4385709 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4385710 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4385711 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4385712 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw

4385741 i rapporti dei nostri esploratori ci hanno confermato che non sono stati mobilitati eserciti nelle pianure il nemico ci attende in citt l si asserraglier tutti i soldati del regno sono stati posti entro la cinta muraria lasciando completamente indifeso il resto del regno
4385742 ma una follia non pu essere vero deve essere una trappola un inganno
4385743 sarebbe una follia se il nostro nemico fosse un uomo come me o come voi signori una persona che lotta per la propria gente per il bene del proprio regno o anche solo per conservare il potere ma non cos ora posso dirvelo quelluomo solamente lavanguardia di un esercito ben pi temibile un esercito creato per uccidere e massacrare distruggere e sterminare un esercito devoto alle forze oscure
4385744 a lui non interessa il regno lui vuole solo tenere la citt per motivi a me sconosciuti vuole la citt per consegnarla poi ai suoi alleati e per far cos dilagare loscurit in questa parte del mondo
4385745 ma non ci riuscir perch noi rappresentiamo il bene noi siamo il bene siamo la luce che squarcer le loro ombre e dissiper loscurit che intendono far calare sulle nostre terre entreremo in citt sconfiggeremo quel regis ed annetteremo anche questo regno al nostro sogno di pace ed unit loscurit sapr che qui abita gente vera uomini pronti a combattere per gli ideali in cui credono loscurit fuggir dinanzi a noi

4385767 when i first brought up this idea some 10 years ago in conservation meetings most people were horrified
4385768 but now as the reality of global warming sinks in and species are already becoming endangered and even going extinct because of climate change im seeing a new willingness in the conservation community to at least talk about the possibility of helping out species by moving them around
4385769 weve got to work on the ones we have a prayer of saving
4385770 ultimately the decision about whether to actively assist the movement of a species into new territories will rest on ethical and aesthetic grounds as much as on hard science

4385797 i believe the well designed complex at the gateway to the mournes is the type of development that may help address some of the current shortfall in affordable hotel accommodation that is impeding tourist development in the mournes and south down in general
4385798 it is also a project that will provide much needed employment for local people as well as giving a boost to the local economy
4385799 to their credit the developers have made clear their intention to integrate the building into the existing environment and have included in their plans a filter lane for traffic easement entering and leaving the hotel
4385800 they have also given assurances they will not be opening a night club in the hotel which they consider inappropriate for what they are planning
4385801 it is essential therefore that south down has as wide a range of accommodation available as possible otherwise the vast majority of tourists will be day trippers and the economic benefits will be negligible

4385868 contra el ruso saldr a fajarme a dar todo lo que pueda pero se que voy a tener que utilizar otros elementos t cticos tener m s velocidad y contra el no se puede caer en golpes afuera
4385869 conf en en mi voy a luchar por una medalla
4385870 fue maravilloso regresar a la caseta y ver todo eso
4385871 creo que nunca he visto algo as especialmente entre dos lanzadores
4385872 creo que nunca he visto cuatro en fila entre dos lanzadores ni tantas carreras cedidas en un partido con una carrera de diferencia con dos outs
4385873 se ven muchas cosas especiales como alguien bateando su jonr n n mero 500 esto es algo que posiblemente sea m s dif cil de ver otra vez podr verse de nuevo dentro de 10 o 15 a os
4385874 los dos primeros no se sienten el tercero ya se empieza a sentir tres en fila
4385875 falt t cnica y t ctica me desesper un poco por el yuko y me fui a buscarla pero cuando hice eso se me meti abajo
4385876 me falta t cnica estoy consciente de eso pero hubo concentraci n y entrega
4385877 es campeona ol mpica pero para m es una igual perd pero son situaciones de los juegos hice lo m o disfrut estoy en noveno lugar en atenas termin en 12 fue bueno pero hubiera querido m s
4385878 todos ellos son rivales complicados especialmente los ucranianos pero nuestro peleadores saben que para ganar las medallas hay que vencer en todos los combates sin importar el que tengas enfrente
4385879 no me importa el rival que me toque estoy decidido a llevarme una medalla ol mpica para dominicana y eso no me lo cuestiona nadie
4385880 estoy ilusionado con la pelea y creo que tengo posibilidades de llegar a los cuartos de final

4385883 we have to come up with a plan for the improvement of the school
4385884 one of the things we havent done and we probably need to do is to take a look at our spending patterns at the high school in relation to personnel and the kinds of programs weve had we havent done a cost analysis and maybe thats something we need to do
4385885 were glad about that our scores are going up theyre just not going up enough
4385886 we move ahead with the confidence that the funding can be secured and the school built and established in time to open as scheduled in 2011
4385887 we have a committee thats working on it but nothing is nailed down
4385888 i am very proud of these catholic laymen and women who have so diligently explored the feasibility of a new catholic high school
4385889 they have proceeded prayerfully and competently investing so much of themselves in the process i am confident that god will continue to bless their faith and their desire to serve the young people of the community
4385890 now we are in the process of finding firm estimates
4385891 certainly a significant amount of money is a safe thing to say
4385892 we were also looking to honor a parish priest who seemed to typify family values a dedication to young people that would go hand in hand with the high school
4385893 but if you wanted in something special like the paratroops you had to commit for three years
4385894 this is what we used to call a hollywood jump
4385895 you dont carry any of the heavy equipment theyre fun jumps
4385896 he is just back from iraq and there is a lot of family he hasnt seen yet

4385907 from the system point of view the natural gas market is broken and it needs fixing
4385908 i think thats pretty obvious based on the constant roller coaster illinois natural gas consumers are forced to ride
4385909 at this time it appears the price of natural gas for ameren illinois utilities residential customers will be 15 cents to 25 cents higher per term this heating season than last year this represents an increase of about 20 to 30 percent over last years heating season
4385910 this is only on the price of gas we dont make a profit on that we cant we are required to sell the natural gas and only recover our cost to purchase it

4385928 ill correct them as we go but i want them to be aggressive first
4385929 we tackle every day and we tackle properly every day
4385930 theyve never tackled this much before now theyve got to learn to transfer what we do pre practice to the field theyll get it but id rather be flagged now in practice than in a game
4385931 all people who are hunting their dreams and goals in life nothing happens unless you first have a dream
4385932 as soon as it happened he was rehabbing and working hard he was really ready to try to get back all he was talking about was being ready for this season
4385933 especially when you have an injury and you have to come back from it you really miss the game when i first came back from it i was very excited it was a slow process but i rehab get better on my knee every day and make progress
4385934 i had cut back on some weight i was as fast as ive ever been so when i had that it was a pretty bad setback
4385935 my roommates i live with some of the best guys
4385936 when that happened i didnt have to worry about anything they made sure i was taken care of i was sitting in bed most of the time with a brace on me if i needed anything they helped me up they made sure i wasnt too down and they kept me company i had a great support system
4385937 we tried to help him with a lot of physical stuff and mentally we told him to keep his head up and keep working because after the last few years hes had sometimes it can be hard on you we tried to keep him upbeat keep him not thinking about it keep him busy and encourage him at all times
4385938 but i went the whole summer without wearing a brace so i said why bother as far as being a skill position player too it kind of restricts you your movement

4385940 i have read foreign publications and learned that in the next 15 years fresh water will be scarce

4385995 the increased imports of fatty alcohols from asia and china in particular are intensifying the degree of competition in the industry
4385996 these imported fatty alcohols are quite often of higher quality but are available at lower prices

4386018 while im not going to comment about those specific allegations its my view that anyone who is illegally involved in diverting water in the murray darling system during this crisis is engaging in an act of terrorism against the people of australia
4386019 this essentially does breach that agreement because it does allow for water to be diverted out of the flood plain for irrigation
4386020 it is a criminal offence and anyone siphoning water off illegally in my view should be locked up rather than the fines that i am told are currently in place
4386021 anyone who is doing this sort of thing is unbelievably treacherous to the national interest and its an act of terrorism against the australian people

4386080 australia at 10 per cent makes it tougher for local manufacturers in competing and drawing innovation and new technology to australia mr reuss said
4386081 we need to look at this on a fair playing field basis theres other countries out there that value their automotive industry greatly their tariffs reflect that
4386082 if it tariffs has to decrease wed like a more gradual decrease as an industry we are pretty united on that the tariff is a big issue for us

4386084 he was in the right frame of mind and wanted to play nothing would have stopped him so that is pleasing i have no idea what will happen between now and the end of august he knew the consequences of playing tonight so the decision was very much his
4386085 i could not think at all about the game on sunday until we had played here but i was very pleased with some of the football we played
4386086 we are in the market for a striker and made a substantial offer which has been well documented we will have to wait and see what happens
4386087 we are trying to address certain weaknesses in the team and we will continue to do that right until the window closes
4386088 we have problems up front as we are missing key personnel we are a little bit light and went with two young guys who are still learning the game it was difficult for them
4386089 i think what the bid does show is that the club is in decent shape financially and that we were able to make a bid of that significance
4386090 you could say a game here is worth two elsewhere but it is more than that
4386091 i want to challenge myself both in matches and in training every day and i want to improve my game that is why i am here as long as the manager keeps me as part of the team that will do for me

4386110 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4386111 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4386112 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4386113 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4386114 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4386115 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4386116 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw

4386125 etwas besonderes seit es den deutschen wm lauf gibt hat ihn noch nie jemand anderes gewonnen als ich und das soll gef lligst auch so bleiben

4386138 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4386139 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4386140 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4386141 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4386142 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4386143 i know that these countries they need help all kinds of help and when you come to a developed country i had the chance to train in good universities like mcgill universitys surgery ive been working in an excellent hospital here in sherbrooke and i feel it is my obligation to give some time and expertise to these poor populations
4386144 because the impeachment process is very harmful to the country and may damage the country we have to find a middle ground through reconciliation and talks
4386145 as i read the president he will never leave the country and wants to stay here
4386146 one concern i have is that this hypothesis has been accepted almost without debate by so many people
4386147 and then some are excluded because theyre not considered severe septic shock
4386148 there were absolutely no patients pulled out before the analysis
4386149 all patients enrolled in the early goal directed therapy study were appropriately selected randomized and examined statistically
4386150 demonstrated that early goal directed therapy yields significant reductions in sepsis related mortality lower organ failure rates and or reduced health care costs particularly due to reduced stays
4386151 routinely given to advance science and treatments for the benefit of patients
4386152 a lot of the experts are turned to by industry for consulting

4386245 still the commodity correction has a mixed message for asia it is occurring because growth is slowing globally and asia as ever remains in part a warrant on global growth
4386246 worries about an economic slowdown in the u s and europe and even japan are weighing on the oil market

4386286 probably the cruellest thing that has ever been done to australians
4386287 so many killed so many tortured so many treated barbarically it should help us remember what has happened in the past and what we should not do in the future
4386288 anyone is able to say whatever they want i know that i am clean i did project believe with usada u s anti doping agency where i purposely wanted to do more tests to prove that
4386289 people can question all they want but the facts are facts and i have the results to prove it

4386293 i have three yes 3 wedding announcements on my fridge and figured it was time to get the cards ready for all those summer wedding celebrations

4386299 it incited a lot of attacks on him from ultranationalists who thought that by simply describing phelpss quest he was saying the u s was better than china
4386300 is that with china doing so well winning so many gold medals leading the count it may be an editorial policy that if you give too much attention to michael phelps there could be a danger of inciting ultranationalism why are you writing about him when china is doing so well they are sensitive to ultranationalism they know the world is watching they dont want any ugliness
4386301 china has one of the worlds oldest people and continuous civilizations consisting of states and cultures dating back more than six millenniums
4386302 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4386303 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4386304 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4386305 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4386306 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help

4386310 when each mud snail has the ability to produce large quantities of embryos without a partner youve really got a problem
4386311 where theyve gotten into streams in the western part of the country theyve caused a lot of problems
4386312 theyre taking over space that should have other native species living in it
4386313 i could sum it up in one word nothing the permit doesnt change a thing
4386314 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4386315 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4386316 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4386317 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4386318 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4386319 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4386320 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw
4386321 as far as being able to go out and do the things he wants to do hes been able to do that

4386384 i mean all i did was make a record with 10 f ing songs on it
4386385 then suddenly through no choice of my own im the new dusty springfield i was born yesterday i made a 60s sounding record and im part of the new british neo soul wave wow
4386386 it can only get bad if you let yourself become something else
4386387 when we chose the songs that were going to make the record we chose a balance of emotions tempos and angles
4386388 but i think it was a very fine tipping point there might just be one or two tracks that have that 60s flavour and had i chosen some other songs instead the album would have been really different
4386389 and whether it was an agent a publicist or record label people were asking can we meet her but i wasnt really ready i just wanted to write songs if i got one good one every month it was a great feeling
4386390 im quite open and sometimes get stung by being a bit too open but who cares people have tried to kind of box me in with other things and say that i dont feel and i havent got soul
4386391 i cant live life explaining myself over and over and apologizing i just have to know that my intentions are good
4386392 i think im already aware theres a fine line in not letting myself become some self indulgent diva who thinks she can have whatever she wants
4386393 the only thing i want is to make good music and make music that i really really feel and to be honest with myself
4386394 if that means writing songs that dont hit the big time all the time well so be it

4386412 this allowed the special interests who are in high positions in our govt to purchase the country with its own money
4386413 over the last few days russia has fired over two dozen ss 21 ballistic short range missiles into the country of georgia integrating ballistic missile strikes with their conventional military forces
4386414 the use of ballistic missiles by russia in this conflict sends an endorsement to the international community that the use of ballistic missiles has value thus propelling countries and terrorist organizations to develop purchase and continue to proliferate ballistic missiles
4386415 this outward military aggression with the use of ballistic missiles from russia on a former ussr country sends a very serious message to all former members of the soviet block especially poland who today made an agreement with the united states to host 10 u
4386416 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4386417 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
4386418 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4386419 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and has agreed to a provisional ceasefire
4386420 unfortunately weve been receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements
4386421 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4386422 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4386423 whats being called the russian blitz of the nation of georgia former soviet republic that split away and is now threatening to split apart from within
4386424 the powerful russian war machine is moving ever deeper into georgia and teaching all of us really a lesson about what makes russia tick
4386425 but after hundreds perhaps thousands killed and tens of thousands displaced tonight georgians are asking when will the russian bear stop
4386426 so how did this fighting start and what is it really all about
4386427 whats troubling about this war fought in a relatively unknown region is that none of the suffering here is about the enclave of ossetia this war is all about russia and the message russia is sending to the world
4386428 russia has itched to strike at southern neighbor georgias brash western oriented leader president mikheil saakashvili and saakashvili gave the kremlin an opportunity when he sent troops into the separatist region of south ossetia last week in an effort to reassert georgias sovereignty
4386429 the most urgent need is to see clearly what is taking place as the crisis deepened one could hear in washington the usual attempts to blame the victim as if georgia somehow deserved this fate because its elected government had opted for friendly relations with the west
4386430 russia as my grandmother could have told george w bush always fights dirty
4386431 russias aggression is really about the subordination of georgia a democratic market oriented u s ally
4386432 in iraq we and our iraqi allies are on the verge of a strategic victory over the jihadists
4386433 russia has sent troops and tanks across an international border
4386434 we owe georgia a serious effort to defend its sovereignty
4386435 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation is that clear enough
4386436 a step toward real security for poland in the future
4386437 the only things we can rely on are god and the americans
4386438 i think we have been frankly pretty restrained in this
4386439 we are planning it it depends on many factors i cant give you the date we have stopped building up troops
4386440 we are not there to defend the ports we are there to provide humanitarian aid
4386441 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4386442 though it is clear that present day russia poses no threat to it nato is methodically and persistently building up its military machine into the east of europe and surrounding russia from the south
4386443 this involves open material and ideological support for color revolutions and the paraxodical forcing of north atlantic interests on central asia
4386444 all this leaves no doubt that they are preparing to completely encircle russia and deprive it of its sovereignty
4386445 never betray in any way the multimillion russian population in ukraine and renounce our unity with it
4386446 foreign policy considering our current situation and possibilities is being conducted sensibly and ever more forward thinking
4386447 but owing to the heavy burden left by his predecessors an awful awful lot in russia has yet to be lifted up from decline the overall state of peoples lives remains hard and chaotic
4386448 did not know if it was georgian russian or ossetian troops who opened fire
4386449 i can prove it with the international organisations already bringing testimony to what im saying
4386450 if tomorrow mr saakashvili signs the document that we have negotiated with russian president mr medvedev then the withdrawal of russian troops can begin
4386451 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4386452 this is going to be a defining crisis in the united states russian relationship the danger is that neither side feels it can back down
4386453 we may only be at the beginning of this crisis rather than at the end of it
4386454 we have no idea what they are doing there why such a heavy force
4386455 one explanation could be that they are just trying to battle the civilian population
4386456 we have information that american military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to tbilisi airport though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago
4386457 lets ask them will they invite you the media to check whether it is humanitarian or not what is in it the cargo in reality it is of major concern to russians
4386458 this was the use of sophisticated weapons against a small town against a sleeping people this was a barbaric assault
4386459 only now theyre beginning to show some pictures of the destruction so this looks to me like it was a well prepared project and with any outcome they wanted to put the blame on russia
4386460 this is the man mr gorbachev who helped to you know bring down kgb kingdom and he is the one who is you know justifying what the kgb people are doing right now in my country
4386461 shame on him shame on you mr gorbachev for perpetuating the very regime you helped to defeat and you fought against as the head of the soviet union
4386462 there is a chance for our two countries to develop a new agenda for cooperation so as to promote both u s and russia interests and the interests of other countries and the interests of stability particularly in the hotspots in different continents
4386463 are outdated comparing to the current level of growth in the country
4386464 according to information that we have on evolution of the education system in angola the scholarity rates developed a lot and the number of teaching staff doubled in the last four years

4386510 after the revelations last month about the depth of my own convict ancestry perhaps i should feel at home here
4386511 i am almost a thoroughbred when it comes to my convict past
4386512 one of my forebears from seven generations back was transported to sydney in 1789 then sent on to norfolk island at the time the only convict settlements in the british empire more remote than port arthur
4386513 this is the most significant convict heritage site in our nation
4386514 in bricks and mortar this stark landscape confronts us with the dramatic story of our nations beginnings a story so familiar that we easily lose sight of just how remarkable and improbable it is
4386515 the story of a faraway land populated by the cast offs of an empire men and women who remain in the blood lines of so many of us today
4386516 the scale of convict transportation to australia was far greater than any other penal colony in the world whether we measure it in terms of the numbers sent the duration of the journey or the vastness of the areas settled
4386517 certainly if there is a cut the banks must pass every single cent on to those who have got home loans and the small business community
4386518 the banks have recently had the benefit of a 20 to 30 basis point cut effectively in the price they are paying for money
4386519 they could be in a position to cuts rates right now before the reserve bank moves if it chooses to do so
4386520 it seems they are not taking seriously what mr swan says and i would expect that the treasurer in fact should be meeting the ceos of the major banks and make absolutely clear to them what the australian public expects
4386521 our banks are in a strong position they are profitable and they need to be but that also means that theyre in a position to fully pass this is on and they must

4386534 hackers believe that essential lesions can be learned about the systems about the world from taking things apart seeing how they work and using this knowledge to create new and even more interesting things they resent any person physical barrier or law that tries to keep them from doing this
4386535 a free exchange of information particularly when information was in the form of a computer program allowed for greater overall creativity in the hacker viewpoint any system could benefit from an easy flow of information
4386536 the best way to promote this free exchange of information is to have an open system something which presents no boundaries between a hacker and a piece of information or an item of equipment that he needs in his quest for knowledge improvement and time on line bureaucracies whether corporate governmental or university based are flawed systems dangerous in that they cannot accommodate the exploratory impulse of hackers because it perceives the constructive impulse of hackers as a threat hackers who were once outcasts found the computer a fantastic equalizer experiencing a feeling of opening a door and walking through to a grand new universe once they passed through that door and sat down at the console of a multi million dollar computer hackers had power so it was natural to distrust any force which might try to limit the extent of that power

4386540 sa palagay ko naman ay di tatalikuran ni pangulong arroyo ang kanyang mga nasabi na sa ibang okasyon na bababa sya sa pwesto sa katapusan ng kanyang termino sa in my opinion president arroyo will not go back on what she said on other occasions that she will step down from her post at the end of her term in 2010

4386543 wala naman kaming iwi withdraw diyan we have nothing to withdraw that is why we want an impartial investigation because the milf forces they government are referring to matagal na sila diyan they have been there for a long time
4386544 the milf forces who are not supposed to be there they will leave if there are any
4386545 the milf forces the government is referring to have been there for a long time
4386546 repositioning this means that troops occupying a certain area will be moved
4386547 a war of aggression is an armed robbery writ large
4386548 simply absurd to put great risk on drawing base points in islands occupied by other countries
4386549 the question is whether the kalayaan group of islands is part of the philippine archipelago we will have extreme difficulty establishing that point because we have never during the centuries of the islands existence regarded the kalayaan as part of the philippine archipelago
4386550 the best protection we have is that we establish these maritime limits in accordance with international laws under unclos even if a group of islands qualify as an archipelago it does not acquire the status of an archipelago unless it draws baselines

4386563 arroyo maintained that the jfcc erred terribly when it wrote president gloria macapagal arroyo instead of the senate to air their concerns on the epira and said they deserved their treatment
4386564 dont listen to anyone who tells you that you cant do this or that thats nonsense go anywhere you want to but never never let them persuade you that things are too difficult or impossible
4386565 if this were some other person much more some other vip it would have been a race to break the story first even with no talking heads or attributions and just based on accounts from anonymous highly placed sources
4386566 abs cbn certainly had a heyday covering previous high profile kidnappings everyone was fair game then
4386567 its the primary job of every professional journalist to prioritize accuracy over speed that is the policy and not the other way around
4386568 in this case it was simply not acceptable because the lives of colleagues were at stake
4386569 doesnt this imply rather clearly that if it were a not a colleague the sacrifice of the policy is acceptable doesnt that imply that msm does indeed view itself as a special stratum of society
4386570 you know youre in love when you cant fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams
4386571 the question is did the media do the right thing in heeding the request i think that would have been an individual call of the editors i think their decision to hold the story was correct
4386572 after all reporters arent any special than everyone else we are all also workers and employees
4386573 with media outfits heeding the request of abs cbn torres said he hoped that in future abductions the network would also heed requests from victims families to hold the story to safeguard lives

4386575 iskolar ng bayan is a label accorded to us because the taxpayers subsidize our education by form of government appropriation to the university not on the basis of the tuition paid
4386576 so you made the unusual deviation from the usual career path since you and i and all up law graduates virtually pursue the same career path after graduation isnt that so we try and get the highest salary we can get but in your case you transferred from a law office with a higher salary to a law office with a lower salary is that correct
4386577 we in san beda law we were taught that law is a noble profession it is not a business am i right to assume that you in up law were taught the same thing
4386578 what is written on the up law school engraved in stone
4386579 the business of a law school is not to teach law but to teach law in the grand manner
4386580 we are brothers and sisters in the profession we should always be motivated by a sense of idealism is this correct
4386581 so when you transfer from a higher paying job to a lower paying job that is not necessarily an erroneous career decision in fact it could be motivated by a sense of idealism
4386582 yes i thought that should be elicited because i was surprised to learn that the usual career path of lawyers is going from lower paying jobs to higher paying jobs
4386583 the students make the school not the other way around
4386584 anonymous said upian ka nga di ka nakiisa sa pag defend sa school natin upian ka nga wala ka namang school spirit dapat sana up right or wrong mag isip isip ka naman sana nakakahiya ka jester sayang lang ang pagiging upian mo
4386585 iskolar ng bayan is a label accorded to us because the taxpayers subsidize our education by form of government appropriation to the university not on the basis of the tuition paid
4386586 but i dont think he has the right to criticize that much even though he graduated from up and doesnt he have said too much to think that he is a co iskolar ng bayan he should have known the feelings of up students being insulted in such disrespectful manner
4386587 you mean had i not been from up you would not be taking the criticism constructively d
4386588 hmmmm lemme think about that maybe no up pride peace
4386589 gusto ko lang mapakita sa kanya na kahit sa pamamagitan ng cost o halaga iskolar pa rin ng bayan
4386590 i think its arrogant of my generation to assign that title to themselves without having earned it
4386591 an ounce of loyalty is worth a pound of cleverness resign your position and when you are on the outside complain to your hearts content but as long as you are a part of the institution do not condemn it
4386592 kung tuition lang ang bumubuhay sa up eh di private school na rin kayo at hindi ka na iskolar ng bayan
4386593 were the best and the brightest which is why the government subsidizes us which is why were called iskolar ng bayan

4386603 above all it seems that the americans changed their opinion as a result of the situation in the caucasus
4386604 in washingtons eyes this conflict proved that russia was not a stable partner for the states
4386605 we will have here in poland not one but two american garrisons we will have one base used to protect the whole of the north atlantic treaty against long range ballistic missiles
4386606 we will also have a battery of 96 patriot missiles located in a spot chosen by poland according to our defence needs
4386607 this is the beginning of the strengthening of the polish defence capabilities and making the polish american alliance concrete
4386608 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 a little bit and try and get out to an early lead
4386609 i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4386610 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win
4386611 its been a long road to get here i cannot believe what has just happened ive won a gold medal
4386612 i was a little bit in shock i was shaking a little bit up there
4386613 seemed to me to be based on the eastern concept that everything is relative to everything else as opposed to the western view that things are merely coincidental
4386614 i had a disease called congenital analgesia which means i couldnt feel anything
4386615 and i was supposed to be in love with you
4386616 and i wouldnt say shes toughened up but instead the problems hitting her now have become bigger at first it was learning to use a typewriter and now its a baby with the father of the baby someone she works with
4386617 some people just arent as likable as others no matter what they do pete campbell does the same stuff as don draper but drapers way more likable and gets away with things
4386618 jon is the lead and he always has something going on
4386619 but i dont think the rest of us feel left out or that we dont get our moments
4386620 i dont think anyone in our cast has any doubt that he always has the best story line in mind and thats what were there to serve
4386621 yesterday he said to me the next episode were shooting is about objects and i said ok
4386622 he always has this grand idea and were just lucky to be part of it
4386623 over seven episodes i had four stages of padding and three stages of makeup
4386624 but ive learned more about the similarities than the differences between then and now
4386625 usually you look back on another era in terms of the milestones but at the same time people were just living their lives
4386626 i think it will be a hot potato currently when a patient gets sick and gets anemia we think it is bad for the patient so we do something about it
4386627 they have shifted in the sense their offerings are best in quality and service and not necessarily the lowest price
4386628 in our retail industry were still learning to adapt to having wal mart were still trying to compete on price
4386629 i call it the retail zoo where the customer is the exhibit
4386630 because the store owner is in a position to install all sorts of surveillance equipment they really believe themselves entitled to use it and treat people as lab rats in a maze or experimental subjects to be watched i find that extremely disturbing

4386638 the impact of human activity measured in terms of the amount of carbon dioxide it causes to be emitted into the atmosphere
4386639 shes going to come out here for the kids birthdays
4386640 it will be the first time the cousins meet im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
4386641 i went through a stage when i was in high school when it wasnt so good but now im at a stage where i really appreciate her a lot more
4386642 thats because you cant take your eyes off of him
4386643 once id decided that id pose for my boyfriend and submit the photos to newcummers he was as happy as a dog with two dicks
4386644 i picked up this little outfit and wouldnt let him see it till the day i posed when i was all ready i called him outside he wandered outside totally starkers holding his camera he stopped dead when he saw me and got a stiffy right away ive never seen his willy get hard so fast i had a hard time keeping him from groping me while i was posing but i probably didnt help by talking dirty to him the whole time thats not something i usually do

4386648 lymphoma was the first malignancy in which antibodies were shown to be effective treatment
4386649 these exciting preliminary results come from using them to harness the bodys own immune responses in a new way
4386650 although the side effects need to be monitored carefully we hope that this type of treatment will prove to be effective in larger trials in the future
4386651 all of the south coast seaside stores have done well
4386652 our customers represent a broad income segment and they are all challenged today
4386653 when energy and oil prices go up on top of inflation health care and core food items theres a great deal of pressure on the customer
4386654 one of the conditions that came out worst was osteoarthritis where we asked people if theyd received basic advice such as doing exercises to control the condition and whether they had effective pain relief
4386655 at the more severe end of the scale for those with severe osteoarthritis we asked if they had been given the opportunity to see a specialist to talk about joint replacement
4386656 there were also issues around whether elderly patients had been asked the reason for their falls these types of areas did not fare so well in the study
4386657 shortfalls in receipt of basic recommended care by adults aged 50 or more with common health conditions in england were most noticeable in areas associated with disability and frailty but few areas were exempt
4386658 efforts to improve care have substantial scope to achieve better health outcomes and particularly need to include chronic conditions that affect quality of life of older people
4386659 these figures show that age discrimination within the nhs is still rife
4386660 the rewards system for gps to treat particular conditions has worked but this hasnt included health problems older people particularly suffer from like depression falls and vision and hearing problems
4386661 these depressing results show that when it comes to healthcare all too often older people and the conditions that affect them come far down the pecking order
4386662 this kind of ageist treatment is precisely why legislation against age discrimination is needed
4386663 the government has announced this will form part of the forthcoming equality bill but no timeframe or process has been agreed until that happens older people will continue to be short changed by the health service
4386664 we know that many older people with osteoarthritis are often fobbed off by gps and told its your age youve got to live with it rather than being offered practical advice on weight loss exercise and pain relief or a referral to see a physiotherapist
4386665 standards of care vary enormously around the country and its simply unacceptable
4386666 older people have a right to high quality care regardless of their age
4386667 it is unacceptable for them to be treated any differently our recent darzi review sets out a framework for improving the quality of care for everybody that uses the nhs
4386668 a lot of progress has been made already with the treatment and care of older people but we recognise more can be done
4386669 we have recently started work on providing an increased focus on preventative care for older people the prevention package will include an expert group to help the nhs better provide services for falls fractures and osteoporosis
4386670 if we came to the point of selling the land it would be sold on the open market
4386671 who might buy the land and who they might provide the facilities for we cant predict
4386672 this is not something the college is planning on building developing and providing for college staff it would be an open market sale

4386675 the request for indonesian police to arrest paul francis callahan on the interpol wanted list has been completed
4386676 he has denied the accusations in court but this is not an examination of the criminal case
4386677 with that there is enough reason and it has met the requirements of extradition
4386678 the defendant is ordered to be extradited immediately to australia
4386679 now the extradition process is not so easy there are many bureaucratic issues
4386680 we have to await presidential authorisation for him to leave
4386681 we cannot predict at all how long this will take
4386682 he is a victim of a romantic relationship with his accuser
4386683 according to paul the alleged victim asked paul to get married but he refused
4386684 people are rattled theyre not sure of their future some of them are deciding its just too hard

4386692 the world has been turned upside down that is what it is like living with an alcoholic
4386693 my work is concerned with british youth culture feminism and the relationships between dress and persona and identity and performance the after school club initially involved documenting clubbers at school themed nightclubs across london i witnessed young women flaunting themselves in revealing uniforms competing for their male counterparts attention their masquerade captivated me and i decided to put their nightclub persona to the test by returning them to their school gates

4386696 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4386697 in the face of russian aggression the very existence of independent georgia and the survival of its democratically elected government are at stake
4386698 t he u n must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world
4386699 the u s is not satisfied to see any other country especially russia be an economic or political power in the world
4386700 russia has a right to defend itself and a right to be concerned about encroachment by the united states in the former soviet republics to be a member of nato is to be a part of the u s imperialist alliance and a threat to world peace
4386701 the bombings killed ossetian civilians our brothers and sisters children women and elderly people there also died hundreds of civilians of georgian nationality both in the conflict zone as well as on the entire territory of georgia the georgian peace committee is going to struggle so that the organizers of this monstrous genocide have a severe and legitimate punishment
4386702 bush committed to support president saakashvili for georgias admission to nato that is like plunging a sharpened dagger deep into russias heart saakashvili on his own would never have jumped to the adventure of sending the georgian army into south ossetia a nuclear war is not something to fool around with and providing cannon fodder to the market cannot be rewarded

4386704 a possible motive for the killing is beginning to emerge concerning the lifestyle of xi zhou and zhen xing yang
4386705 community intelligence supported by the examination of computer equipment and mobile call data has shown that both of the victims have been involved in fraudulent activity which has angered and upset a number of people

4386708 i came in about 10 15pm and there were police officers outside and they handed me a leaflet saying dont be worried theyre just looking into the neighbourhood there have been three terror arrests
4386709 it was quite hard to see which houses because there were crowds of people outside and two police cars and a van
4386710 its really worrying that its so close its like oh my god who is it you cant believe its actually happening on your street in your community
4386711 we have never had any problems and have a very good relationship with the kashmiri community and have done for a very long time
4386712 i cant make any further comment until i know more about the incident
4386713 this has had no effect on the airport it is a total police operation and we didnt even know that it had happened until afterwards
4386714 lancashire constabulary will investigate any information that is passed to us and ensure it is accurate before responding in a proportionate and measured way
4386715 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned
4386716 however these types of inquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve
4386717 i would ask local residents to be patient with us and to be assured that we will keep them updated in relation to the investigation as and when we can
4386718 i was shocked when i learned feroze was involved in terrorism and i am equally shocked there have been arrests again so close to where i live
4386719 this has come out of the blue again the community was very calm back then and it is now
4386720 i came in about 10 15pm and there were police officers outside and they handed me a leaflet saying dont be worried theyre just looking into the neighbourhood there have been three terror arrests
4386721 it was quite hard to see which houses because there were crowds of people outside and two police cars and a van

4386726 i felt a bit subdued usually i shoot with more aggression obviously im absolutely gutted
4386727 i didnt shoot too many bad shots but i struggled with the wind it was really tough and the scores reflect that
4386728 a few of the guys got it right and shot well but i found it really tough and did the best i could on the day

4386736 the only place that there is a bit of relief is in relation to some of the regional centres around tasmania
4386737 its not for good reasons its just that house prices have stalled there and hence buying into the market isnt as expensive as it was say 12 months ago
4386738 theyre looking at a shared equity scheme where the governments putting up 50 000 for young people to help get them into the housing market and weve been actively working with them since the state budget to try and get that policy changed from policy into reality
4386739 you know at the moment in an environment where weve seen 12 successive interest rate rises its certainly dampened peoples capacity to be able to get into the market

4386742 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4386743 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4386744 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4386745 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4386746 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4386747 as far as being able to go out and do the things he wants to do hes been able to do that
4386748 thats so much better than a number on a scale

4386753 if youre down and you lay down if you fall out of it or you get beat that goes to show what kind of team you are if you stay in the hunt and you battle it out and we win i think that tells us what kind of team we are too theres two ways to look at it you know what if we get down and we dont come back were not champions and were not men
4386754 weve got to keep our cool though as long as we do that and as long as we come to the ballpark with the idea of winning that game on that day and our pitchers give us performances like that were definitely going to win some games weve got 41 left you play them all the same we need to win a game and get going and see if cant run off four or five or six in a row or something were alright were a game back if you would have asked me if i would take a game back with 41 to play i would have said yes theres no sense in us getting all bent out of shape because weve been close all year its going to be close for the next six weeks
4386755 he knows us better than we know ourselves because he watches the game every day its tough were going out there and were busting our rear ends its not like were trying to lose we just got outpitched outplayed everything you dont get swept in a series if the other team doesnt just outplay you

4386761 we had a brief break in the weather earlier today which allowed us to hone in on the beacon but it closed in again soon after and the rescuers had to turn back
4386762 we now have a general idea where the signal is coming from and that will hasten the process tomorrow but with something like this the signal pings off all the mountains and it takes a bit of time to triangulate the location

4386772 there has been an israeli uproar about the reinforcement of hizbullahs strength there has been talk of sophisticated arms and an air defense system and threats if hizbullah uses this kind of system
4386773 no one can expect me to stand up and say whether we possess new weapons or we dont
4386774 keeping weapons secret is part of hizbullahs strength this is part of directing the battle of liberation and resistance against this enemy

4386777 died two years ago in lebanon and will be brought to political burial in two months

4386921 there was a growing increase in prescriptive pill abuse and drug dealing
4386922 in terms of a police investigation it can be very difficult because somebodys got a prescription thats legal having it on them is not an offence but selling is
4386923 we were seeing crimes that we know could be directly linked to drugs
4386924 everything from arsons break and enters thefts and stolen goods we know that all of these areas are tied together in some form
4386925 there are so many poor little kids around here hooked they say glace bay has got more drugs than halifax
4386926 its become just like giving somebody a sandwich or an apple

4386930 die universit t muss bei ihren zuk nftigen erweiterungsm glichkeiten an einen horizont von 20 30 oder mehr jahren denken will sie in der weltelite der forschung und lehre mitspielen von karlsruher politikern h tte ich vielmehr erwartet dass sie professor hippler massiv unterst tzen fl chen f r die elite uni und das kit direkt neben dem campus zu sichern
4386931 das hei t aber noch lange nicht dass der vorschlag des rektors gescheitert ist die entwicklung der uni in der mackensen und anderen ehemaligen kasernen hilft nur begrenzt zum beispiel bei geb uden und fl chen f r spezielle technische anwendungen
4386932 cramer dies jedoch nicht wahrhaben wolle und stattdessen lieber an der arbeit der abgeordneten herum motze
4386933 in sachen wildparkstadion ist daher im augenblick der gemeinderat gefragt und nicht der landtag
4386934 ich halte es f r respektlos wie mit herrn hippler umgegangen wird insbesondere was frau splett u ert
4386935 der ganze prozess l uft und man soll ihn auch laufen lassen und sich nicht dauernd einmischen
4386936 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4386937 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4386938 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4386939 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4386940 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4386941 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4386942 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw
4386943 i there a waterproof camcorder case that fit a dxg model 506v

4386945 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4386946 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4386947 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4386948 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4386949 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4386950 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4386951 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4386952 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4386953 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4386954 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4386955 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4386956 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4386957 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4386958 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4386959 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4386960 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4386961 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4386962 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4386963 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4386964 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4386965 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4386966 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4386967 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4386968 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4386969 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4386970 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4386971 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4386972 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4386973 i would call it the most valuable piece of real estate in the world right now
4386974 chinese consumers are getting more money now and in their leisure time they will spend a lot on culture and sports

4386983 in leading up to this blog we have seen a lot of discussion in blogs about what microsoft might be trying to accomplish by maintaining a little bit more control over the communication around windows 7 some might say that this is a significant understatement
4386984 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk again top of mind for us is the responsibility we feel to make sure we are not stressing priorities churning resource allocations or causing strategic confusion among the tens of thousands of partners and customers who care deeply and have much invested in the evolution of windows

4386989 this is an extension of a technology thats been around in the server world for several years
4386990 on servers you have something thats called a service processor thats always awake and can do things like monitor the system do reboots and run diagnostics youd have complete remote access to your home pc you could do that now but the computer has to be turned on all the time and sleep mode can interfere with remote operations

4387077 the lack of tariff protection is a blow to the industry as it puts australia out on a limb ahead of the rest of the world
4387078 australia at 10 per cent makes it tougher for local manufacturers in competing and drawing innovation and new technology to australia
4387079 there was a less distorting impact on the australian economy of transitional grants than there was in fact in maintaining a high tariff level
4387080 in some peoples minds industry policy is only about tariffs
4387081 lets make no mistake restructure is a euphemism for buying out jobs so there will be substantial job losses
4387082 kim carr and kevin rudd have squibbed us in relation to the automotive sector because they were full of promise over the last two years and now have basically come into lockstep with us
4387083 one thing i was pleased about and thats the green car fund the bracks review has in fact adopted the coalition policy which is to bring that money forward to 2009
4387084 that was my criticism and the criticism of many others in relation to the 35 million gift that was given to toyota out of the green car fund
4387085 there was no competitive process no analysis of it it was simply a photo opportunity in tokyo
4387086 kevin rudd and kim carr went around at the last election campaigning against lower tariffs and free trade agreements
4387087 that seems to be the big thing of the bracks review we should continue to decrease tariffs and we should continue to pursue free trade agreements which is exactly what the coalitions policy was at the last election

4387096 as i look back on the last decade of my life i attribute the largest single personal professional and peace of mind gains to matthew and his coaching mentoring thru matthews guidance i have been able to build a life that i love living sure he was there when i bought my first rolex bmw made the first million but those things really pale in comparison with the real gifts such as learning how to be grateful and accepting myself and other people unconditionally matthew is one of the rarest people on the planet because of the intensity in which he projects his energy in fulfilling other peoples dreams whether you are seeking fame fortune joy acceptance or just pure bliss the teacher is ready when you are and his name is matthew ferry
4387097 dont contact mathew unless you want to experience abundance in all areas of your life i was in my worst financial and mental break down stemming from a divorce after being introduced to matthew ferry three months into his coaching i could easily communicate with my ex wife who i had on going legal proceeding with for the past 6 years without a lawyer present i also reset the relationship and deeply connect with my ex business partner who i havent talked to for 10 years most amazingly i have reconnected with the freedom i felt when i was fresh out from school while my business is flying once you sign up with his teaching you will naturally understand his teaching effortlessly matthew an ordinary loving guy transformed the universes secret into simple common sense

4387100 ive been putting off following up with howard schultz of starbucks for months now simply because i probably didnt want to be rejected and was listening to my drunk monkey given good excuses about how its been the right time finally after starting matthews teleseminar i decided to call mr schultz personal secretary once again tell her what i wanted and ask for a personal appt to meet w him directly and not with his subordinates the results are still pending but it doesnt matter because i felt great unstoppable and i feel on my way to bigger breakthroughs whats awesome about this is that it occurred after only our first call i cant wait to see what happens after the 2nd
4387101 this meeting was very important as we shift from legislative advocacy to the hard work of implementation

4387103 love is not love which alters when it alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove o no it is an ever fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken it is the star to every wandering bark whose worths unknown although his height be taken loves not times fool though rosy lips and cheek within his bending sickles compass come love alters not with his brief hours and weeks but bears it out even to the edge of doom

4387124 mine was a bit less epic than batman begins it was more about the progression of him and it was more in gotham city he didnt go to tibet and meet cool people but it was very similar in vibe in my version there was actually a new villain it wasnt one of the classics which is probably why they didnt use it it was more of a hannibal lecter type he was somebody already in arkham asylum that bruce went and sort of studied with it was a whole thing i get very emotional about it i still love the story maybe ill get to do it as a comic one day
4387125 this is the summer of the comic book movie and not the comedy

4387137 chinese consumers are getting more money now and in their leisure time they will spend a lot on culture and sports

4387148 these figures show that our countrys economy is still maintaining fast but balanced growth
4387149 they can rather send us back to our country government wants us to be killed by insisting on reintegration
4387150 only one person was given asylum and 189 others were told to leave
4387151 we do not understand this because we have government identity documents that expire only next year
4387152 i dont think it chairmanship changes terribly much it is just a procedural issue
4387153 the only thing more wonderful than watching an amazing woman fall in love is wishing her every happiness in life
4387154 allison cmon do you have to take a picture really
4387155 one of the conditions that came out worst was osteoarthritis where we asked people if theyd received basic advice such as doing exercises to control the condition and whether they had effective pain relief
4387156 at the more severe end of the scale for those with severe osteoarthritis we asked if they had been given the opportunity to see a specialist to talk about joint replacement
4387157 there were also issues around whether elderly patients had been asked the reason for their falls these types of areas did not fare so well in the study
4387158 shortfalls in receipt of basic recommended care by adults aged 50 or more with common health conditions in england were most noticeable in areas associated with disability and frailty but few areas were exempt
4387159 efforts to improve care have substantial scope to achieve better health outcomes and particularly need to include chronic conditions that affect quality of life of older people
4387160 these figures show that age discrimination within the nhs is still rife
4387161 the rewards system for gps to treat particular conditions has worked but this hasnt included health problems older people particularly suffer from like depression falls and vision and hearing problems
4387162 these depressing results show that when it comes to healthcare all too often older people and the conditions that affect them come far down the pecking order
4387163 this kind of ageist treatment is precisely why legislation against age discrimination is needed
4387164 the government has announced this will form part of the forthcoming equality bill but no timeframe or process has been agreed until that happens older people will continue to be short changed by the health service
4387165 we know that many older people with osteoarthritis are often fobbed off by gps and told its your age youve got to live with it rather than being offered practical advice on weight loss exercise and pain relief or a referral to see a physiotherapist
4387166 standards of care vary enormously around the country and its simply unacceptable
4387167 older people have a right to high quality care regardless of their age
4387168 it is unacceptable for them to be treated any differently our recent darzi review sets out a framework for improving the quality of care for everybody that uses the nhs
4387169 a lot of progress has been made already with the treatment and care of older people but we recognise more can be done
4387170 we have recently started work on providing an increased focus on preventative care for older people the prevention package will include an expert group to help the nhs better provide services for falls fractures and osteoporosis
4387171 lymphoma was the first malignancy in which antibodies were shown to be effective treatment
4387172 these exciting preliminary results come from using them to harness the bodys own immune responses in a new way
4387173 although the side effects need to be monitored carefully we hope that this type of treatment will prove to be effective in larger trials in the future
4387174 zeker in het licht van de turbulente marktomgeving is dat goed
4387175 in april en mei zagen we een stabilisatie en verbetering van de markt die zich helaas in juni en juli niet heeft voortgezet
4387176 augustus lijkt rustiger maar de crisis lijkt langer aan te houden dan verwacht we denken niet dat er op korte termijn iets verandert
4387177 er is een crisis op de aandelenmarkten deze wordt gecombineerd met de angst voor een recessie en banken die hun balansen aan het leegpompen zijn omdat ze miljarden hebben afgeboekt ik loop al lang mee maar dit is een heel nieuwe ervaring

4387283 sadly again in the last few days there have been a number of suspected heroin overdoses
4387284 to our knowledge there have been eight since august 10 and sadly four of those persons did not recover and died as a result

4387289 you should not have any second thoughts about your decision
4387290 you will never be better informed than you are at this moment
4387291 while im not going to comment about those specific allegations its my view that anyone who is illegally involved in diverting water in the murray darling system during this crisis is engaging in an act of terrorism against the people of australia
4387292 it is a criminal offence and anyone siphoning water off illegally in my view should be locked up rather than the fines that i am told are currently in place
4387293 anyone who is doing this sort of thing is unbelievably treacherous to the national interest and its an act of terrorism against the australian people

4387298 i would see this as very on line with what forster recommended
4387299 he recommended a flatter structure greater performance greater accountability increased transparency and ensuring that the majority of our 8 5 billion budget is directed at clinical services
4387300 this will allow larger and better resourced districts to deliver local health services and important hospital building programs

4387310 by recycling organic waste into energy utilising biomass and clean combined heat and power chp methods alongside our solar hydro and wind power projects we are trying to establish what we think is a stable sensible long lasting energy solution that will maintain the modern quality of life and benefit future generations

4387326 a second hand lime green wrx with 20 inch wheels doof doof music blaring and fluffy dice hanging from the rear vision mirror is not a great ad for the brand
4387327 ich freue mich schon sehr auf mein erstes kart rennen
4387328 dass ich durch meine teilnahme anderen menschen auch noch etwas gutes tun kann finde ich nat rlich super
4387329 ich habe selbst schon ein paar trainingsrunden gedreht und baue auf starke teammitglieder wir wollen auf jeden fall vorne mitmischen
4387330 es war f r mich und meine lebensgef hrtin nicht so leicht weibliche teilnehmer f r das kartrennen zu finden desto mehr freuen wir uns dass daniela f r den guten zweck ins kart steigt sie beweist damit dass sie nicht nur als model eine gute figur macht sondern den jungs auch hinterm steuer einheizt
4387331 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
4387332 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every millilitre of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth around half of these have yet to be named and we are trying to describe and name the new species
4387333 interestingly this species was isolated from within the oral tissues both in oral cancers and normal healthy tissue
4387334 this confirms other work showing that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
4387335 we wont see a crash scenario but we dont expect a recovery over the next six months

4387344 the market is pricing in a significant cut roughly 50 percent or more
4387345 in the next five to 10 years i see more consolidation in every region of the world
4387346 we should expect to see chinese automakers exporting to north america soon as well as european manufacturers bringing their small cars here to manufacture and sell here as well as export back home to take advantage of the weak dollar
4387347 the rest of the regions its going to be more about working with other companies on say platforms or specific deals on buying products
4387348 no one is going to buy a car company like this in the market that its in and expect okay why dont we see if we can go sell it now after one year
4387349 obviously this was a rotational play but the development remained healthy

4387351 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
4387352 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago
4387353 during the past year many of the top social networking sites have demonstrated rapid growth in their global user bases
4387354 facebooks recent ascension to become the top global social networking site has been spurred by its substantial growth across worldwide regions
4387355 the july retail sales report was much as expected plunging vehicle sales dragged down the headline figure and the rise in ex autos spending will have been eaten up by higher food and gasoline prices
4387356 the consumer is still under enormous pressure as employment is declining real wages are down housing and stock market wealth are down and credit conditions continue to tighten and the surge of stimulus payments is now over
4387357 right now in the us in particular we have a really strong concentration of the industry
4387358 so a lot of people are really concerned about this do we really want all of our traffic all of our editorial control of the internet all being piped through one two or three companies
4387359 i dont think we do i think we want to have a broader marketplace than that
4387360 all of the existing search engines are proprietary black boxes

4387365 the moon is once again a popular destination as several space faring nations are talking about setting up bases there one reason would be to mine fuel for future fusion reactors the fuel in this case is helium 3 a lighter isotope of the helium used in balloons in high energy collisions helium 3 fuses with other nuclei to release more energy and less waste than the reactions in traditional nuclear reactors if we can show that we can burn helium 3 it is a much cleaner and safer energy source than other nuclear fuels said gerald kulcinski director of the fusion technology institute at the university of wisconsin at madison just 40 tons of this stuff has enough potential energy to meet the total u s electricity demand for a year however there is almost no helium 3 on earth the closest supply is on the moon
4387366 being down two match points and the other guys serve youre never really feeling good
4387367 but looking back i might have needed a tough match like this
4387368 i saw that and i dont know if thats a game hes completely comfortable with
4387369 i knew if i could make him play stick to that game i probably had a decent shot at the breaker
4387370 i played a horrible service game the next one and somehow got through it
4387371 i felt like i was on the verge of doing a lot of the right things tonight
4387372 when you can take someones best and fight them off and fight them off and fight them off and fight them off and finally three hours later get the win its a good feeling
4387373 the feeling was amazing of course we were celebrating all together
4387374 mongolians were waiting a long time for this finally we got it
4387375 we hope this is a sign that mongolians will rally together
4387376 we see this as a source of great national pride its a big deal
4387377 mongolians are celebrating this remarkable event throughout the country with much happiness
4387378 we hope we will get more medals in these olympics
4387379 muy triste porque no he perdido la pelea me la quitaron nunca me sent perdedor dominaba el combate l yan li s lo corr a y daba golpes ilegales

4387383 the determination of what constitutes a single executory contract or several separate ones will be governed by applicable state law though the bankruptcy court will decide the issue for example where a franchisee enters into a franchise agreement and in conjunction therewith also enters into a software license agreement at the same time those two documents even though signed separately will likely be deemed a single executory contract such that the debtor must assume both or reject both
4387384 if a franchise agreement is not expressly assumed it is deemed rejected and the franchisor has a general unsecured claim against the estate for damages the bankruptcy code provides that the rejection constitutes a breach of the contract which is deemed to have occurred immediately before the filing of the petition by rejecting the agreement the trustee or debtor forgoes the benefits of performance by the other party but avoids the burden of performance by the estate while the charges which accrued after the case was filed are in this context part of the prepetition claim to the extent that the contract benefited the estate after the case was filed a claim can also be made for payment of the charges incurred during the case as an administrative expense to be paid in full and on a higher priority than payments to general unsecured creditors

4387393 of course future decisions will be based as i have always said on the advice of our military commanders on the ground
4387394 but just as last year we moved from combat to overwatch we would expect a further fundamental change of mission in the first months of 2009
4387395 although it is hoped that the uk military presence in iraq will decrease significantly in the future it is still too early to discuss the size and shape of a reduced uk forces footprint
4387396 in his statement to the house of commons on july 22 the prime minister set out our intent to make a fundamental change to the uk mission in iraq in the first months of 2009
4387397 as ever this will be based on conditions on the ground the plans of our coalition partners and the military contribution requested of us by the government of iraq under a long term bilateral relationship
4387398 as a key coalition partner the us is intimately involved with the development of our future plans
4387399 i think you can expect to see us gold medal competitive in about eight events which is phenomenal
4387400 and because of the previous performances at the world championships we are odds on favourite and whichever way you look at it you cant avoid that
4387401 its a combination of money the right people the best equipment and just a very positive mentality

4387409 i am too small to live big happen around me less and less flutter around me mysteries of small things give me back my portion of the world on a small saucer
4387410 i sing to audiences who know little or no yiddish so my yiddish knowledge is vital in giving an experience of the music and also a way in through english explanation to a slice of history and a momentary immersion into the humanity of a lost culture with ideas still pertinent to today
4387411 i want people to engage with the songs actively whether that be by making connections to today enjoying the humour joining in with choruses of political protest or crying from the poignancy
4387412 my band has begun to research and perform london yiddish songs which bring new nuances to locations like victoria park and leicester square
4387413 to make people aware of it to keep it alive or maybe even to revive it to make it something cool and trendy but thats hard to reach yiddish rap is of course a niche product and itll probably stay that way i just dont want yiddish to disappear completely especially not in germany
4387414 germans that read or listen carefully to my yiddish raps can understand a big part
4387415 there are several different german dialects like schwabian or bavarian so for them yiddish is just like one more unknown dialect many words in everyday german are from yiddish words that everyone uses from young to old without knowing that its yiddish
4387416 mixes yiddish song especially the radical political material with my interests in brechtian cabaret punk rock and modern folk songwriting personally i think yiddish is cool musically it sounds beautiful and powerful and the more i learn about its rich literature and complexity the more i love it
4387417 its interesting to sing a germanic language like yiddish for a german speaking audience often theyll understand the yiddish better than my english translations
4387418 every aspect of jewish life jewish culture jewish values has somehow been transmuted into something else in which yiddish plays no part
4387419 if you consider that 8 10 million people spoke in this language and partook of this culture then theres been a really serious rupture
4387420 learning yiddish brings people into a normal cultural yiddish sphere which they cant access in any other way with regards to a language and a culture that doesnt have a territory
4387421 a lot of people who learn yiddish are doing so because they have a sense that there was once a very rich yiddish jewish culture that for a whole multitude of reasons the holocaust stalinism zionism and a marginalisation of yiddish by jews isnt in the public domain at all i grew up in this culture and understand it and it matters to me that others to understand it in as authentic a way as possible
4387422 harry didnt leave in the hope of finding a better life just a life the option to return was not there for him for obvious reasons and by 1945 the poland he had left did not exist any more
4387423 my sympathy for the plight of the modern polack is thus limited and if england is not the land of milk and honey it appeared to them three or four years ago then frankly they can clear off out of it
4387424 we were horrified by the giles coren article not only because it was directly insulting to the polish community in this country and based on ignorance of the past but also because it sought to undermine the progress of closer links between our two communities in the uk
4387425 the piece is just so insulting and we cant bear to let these remarks go by the federation of poles in uk strongly supports a polish jewish dialogue over our common heritage and urges the eradication of misunderstanding and prejudice that has existed between poles and jews
4387426 we are going to have to pass on this one
4387427 as soon as i found out i was moving to london my first phone call was to manager michael stone even before telling my old man
4387428 wingate is a great club and the future looks really bright there is a big jewish community here and i know a lot of people im excited to be here
4387429 in the end though getting a contract was between me and another young player ryan shawcross and he won he has gone on to join stoke city and will play in the premier league this season
4387430 its good that there are several jewish players here obviously wingate would like to have more but we are playing at a very high standard jewish boys can make it but it doesnt just require ability it requires a lot of commitment and that is just something most of them dont have
4387431 weve had a good pre season and its also nice to see a good competition for places this is what we wanted to see with players looking over their shoulder to battle and earn the right to start
4387432 last season we struggled to stay in this league so you cant expect to make the turnaround so quickly were also making strides off the pitch but its going to be a slow and steady progress the aim is trying to maintain and establish ourselves in this league
4387433 weve gained a lot more experienced players who have played at higher level and have a good mix now of youth and experience
4387434 we want to see improvement from last season with the likes of dean nyman daniel stanton myself and now mike sacks there is a good a breed of jewish players
4387435 we have eyed london and the uk market closely for the past five to seven years as it emerged and secured its place as an international and cosmopolitan fashion and luxury capital
4387436 as a global brand of course we would love to have an even bigger presence in the uk with additional points of sale in markets outside london as well as another flagship
4387437 we havent seen much impact of the current talk of recession in sales and some markets like brazil mexico dubai and russia are booming
4387438 in the us tourists all over the world are taking advantage of the weaker dollar to go shopping
4387439 we are all waiting to see if it will materialise
4387440 not because people are not buying but because there is a great demand for oversized jewellery and gold is very expensive today so we have to be innovative with our shapes and textures to create large surfaces without too much weight
4387441 but you dont need to be a millionaire to wear h stern
4387442 it was a delight to go to the movies and see it on the big screen
4387443 most people now see how much the diamond industry has done to regulate this issue and protect the consumer the worst of this terrible situation happened many years ago and has been reduced to a very small portion of the worlds output
4387444 where in the world am i going to keep this
4387445 i love all kinds of art and i love music i enjoy rap hip hop reggae reggaeton and soul music i have to listen to it everywhere i go i draw and paint too but i dont have much time for that im into computers and sometimes if i have a little time i like to play computer games i like to watch the simpsons and south park on tv my life has become very busy since i started to model for score people ask me how i became a score model i discovered score when i answered their website beascoremodel com
4387446 karina hart has ruined me for all other women her breasts are perfect and the curve of her hips and ass are absolutely divine miss hart is perfectly proportioned from top to bottom while your pictures are a good start this is a woman who should have her likeness immortalized in marble she is far and away the most incredible model i have ever laid eyes on and definitely a future member of the pantheon of greats thank you for bringing us this truly tremendous discovery she already has my vote for newcomer of the year
4387447 where in the world did you find that beautiful angel karina hart
4387448 the excellent result from this trial reaffirms that the 400 mg bronchitol dose being used in the phase 3 trials is optimal for its clinical effectiveness we look forward to the results from the ongoing phase 3 studies and to bringing bronchitol to the market as rapidly as possible
4387449 this study reinforces that by utilizing dicer substrate technology we can knock down the expression of a targeted gene in a way that is highly selective specific and more potent than other rnai approaches furthermore our research suggests that aptamer dsirna delivery systems may offer an important new approach to treating hiv and potentially other infectious diseases in this particular study although the aptamer provided some inhibitory function when tested in this setting alone the dsirna chimeras provided more potent inhibition than the aptamer alone thus suggesting cooperative action between the dsirna and aptamer portions in inhibiting replication and spread of hiv
4387450 the goal of this study was to define modification patterns of 27 mer dsirnas that would be useful for research purposes and would remain active at most sites in different genes regardless of sequence context based on the chemical modifications we explored in this study it appears that the 2 ome modification may provide more generalized protection from immune responses than other 2 modifications
4387451 modification patterns of this kind may be useful in therapeutic applications of dicer substrate processed rnai molecules we expect that more extensively modified sequences could be developed for specific sites that would have increased nuclease stability and yet retain high potency which are desirable for pharmaceutical applications such as we are pursuing at dicerna
4387452 dicernas dicer substrate technology offers a new avenue to harness gene silencing and address the entire transcriptome for drug development these studies add to the growing body of data that will allow us to maximize the potential of this technology to develop novel potent and selective drug candidates for important unmet medical needs
4387453 our study shows that early weight loss can reduce the risk factors that so often lead to diabetes complications and death
4387454 weve known for a long time that weight loss is an important component in diabetes treatment and prevention now it appears there may be a critical window of opportunity following diagnosis in which some lasting gains can be achieved if people are willing to take immediate steps toward lifestyle changes
4387455 we dont know if the initial weight loss increased the bodys sensitivity to insulin or if the sustained lifestyle changes were the reason for the long term health benefits
4387456 but we do know that losing weight reduces the risk factors that often lead to heart disease blindness nerve and kidney damage amputations and death in type 2 diabetes patients
4387457 these analyses confirm the validity of our anti melanoma program using our models we have repeatedly demonstrated that vitiligo derived igg preparations can prevent tumor growth further we have observed a dose response to vitiligo derived igg based therapy
4387458 these positive results continue to keep us on track to file our ind with the u s food and drug administration in the near term

4387495 as the countrys future depends mostly on the result of the forthcoming legislative elections the youths should give their example showing that they are willing to do their best in favour of the countrys development
4387496 this is an opportunity and however let us not miss it on 05 september we have to turn up at the polling stations and elect freely and consciously those who will lead the countrys destinies in the coming four years
4387497 everybodys coming back to take stock of their lives you know what i say leave your livestock alone

4387500 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4387501 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4387502 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4387503 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4387504 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4387505 gt day eight of olympic sale get a great deal on
4387506 i was working on a kibbutz collective farm and learning hebrew with a few other guys from outside israel
4387507 they were going to get army training and use that experience to go back home to get jobs
4387508 if i did six months i knew id just learn more hebrew in the army education component and maybe rake leaves and drive a car i figured if i was joining i would do something not nothing
4387509 so little really happens despite media reports about bombs and shootings ive never been fearful the country is small but its big enough that when something happens its far enough away
4387510 as i go about my duties i feel im doing something to help israel and the jews that are there when i was living at home it was important to me that there was an israel i had friends there now its important to me to know im helping keep the country safe
4387511 the goal time was 10 5 minutes and the first time it took me 22 minutes the final time when i passed i was at 8 5 minutes
4387512 we did the course in full gear with a helmet combat vest and a 3 46 kilogram gun it was running a few hundred metres jumping over a two metre wall crossing parallel bars jumping over one metre high logs running through tires climbing a four to five metre rope using only your legs that was the hardest part of the course then crawling on your stomach jumping through a window and doing a final 700 metre run
4387513 if im off for a weekend and go to the grocery store in my t shirt shorts and flip flops im carrying my gun if you lose it theres a heavy punishment up to seven years in jail time were all given precautionary measures to protect the gun from home theft like taking it apart and stashing parts in various areas
4387514 there are times after briefings when were told not to talk about things to our parents or on cellphones or on buses people cant take pictures of us with our guns as many tourists want to do the big concern is being kidnapped as soldiers
4387515 as a lone soldier the army takes good care of me there are between 4 000 and 6 000 lone soldiers at any time the army pays for me to attend university when i finish my tour they pay for my apartment add a bonus to my salary for day to day living and give a 30 day leave each year to go home
4387516 ive learned the importance of taking care of people ive seen no street or store robberies because everyone knows many people walking the streets have been in combat units and will act if they see an incident
4387517 i learned hebrew in four months and with the physical things they put you through i realized i can do it no matter how hard im pushed
4387518 if i have to face it im ready ive been with the same guys in the same unit since i started we trust each other and were confident each of us knows what were doing
4387519 i usually go about ignoring such things but when someone says as has often been incorrectly alleged id abuse a romantic attachment as a publicity stunt or to promote a new movie of mine thats really just way below the belt
4387520 to love and be loved is the most beautiful thing that can happen to a person and ones own life is much more important than all the glamour and fame in the world
4387521 i would like to express my sincere gratitude to the d put s that are ending their tenure
4387522 in fact my sincere thanks also go to the heads of the house as well as the senate with which they were able to serve the country exceptionally
4387523 the fact that you even attended proceedings on the last day to vote some more bills into law means you have really given in so much of your effort for the development of this country and i request to continue serving in other capacities
4387524 some people think this not so easy for this organ because members of parliament from other political parties are not so free enough their tendency is to adopt the point of view of the ruling party
4387525 must get to the next note without sustain cant quite do this thing without three hands
4387526 throughout our conversation he has been calm measured and disinclined to rubbish the supermarket chains
4387527 but my suggestion that big food industrial scale operators are the way ahead sends him whizzing off piste jabbing his finger at me he lets rip what all run by gigantic corporations is that really the answer i think not that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring that there is no food in the future
4387528 bouncing in his chair the prince sets out his nightmare vision a world in which millions of small farmers are driven off their land by global conglomerates into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
4387529 very important to talk to them they respond i find
4387530 few of his claims are based on data from the real world while some of the agricultural and environmental problems he highlights are clearly genuine his explanations for them are long on bombast and short on evidence
4387531 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity that has gone seriously wrong
4387532 hundreds of millions of consumers in the united states have been eating gm food for 12 years with no evidence of any health problems
4387533 gm crops have not contributed to the problem but they may help to offer a medium term solution scientists are working actively to develop new crop varieties that require less water and that grow in more saline soils using both transgenic and conventional breeding techniques

4387541 fires have a lot of different effects when we fire the 155s from here the enemy doesnt hear the round coming in it immediately puts the enemy on the defensive and has a tremendous demoralizing effect
4387542 it seems like time stopped here 2 000 years ago
4387543 we see these kids running around with nothing not even shoes and we want to change that
4387544 the seeds of many problems that continue to plague our troops and mission in iraq were planted in the failure to adequately plan for the conflict and properly equip our men and women in uniform congress must be sure that we are prepared to withdraw our forces without any unnecessary danger
4387545 i believe that the debate here on the hill and the issues that have been raised have been helpful in bringing pressure to bear on the maliki government and on the iraqis in knowing that there is a very real limit to american patience in this entire enterprise
4387546 whether the secretary of defense and the joint chiefs have been briefed about the level of planning
4387547 what kind of timeline would exist if a decision for either military or political reasons were taken to begin withdrawal
4387548 thank you senator i do think such an adaptation if the conditions on the ground call for it will be part of this position

4387551 i can understand links being made because david healy didnt feature very much last season and he didnt feature very much in the pre season games
4387552 its fairly obvious to everyone that having paid the money weve paid for bobby zamora and andy johnson that they will be the first two centre forwards
4387553 we were inspired by old style 1980s films like ghostbusters and back to the future and fancied setting something like that locally the young people reasoned that it was about time we had one of those futuristic fantasy films set in belfast
4387554 i feel that this will be a great opportunity for both me and my family i am really looking forward to playing rugby in europe and for a team with such a vivid following as ulster
4387555 meeting new people and seeing new places is always exciting and i cant wait to join the rest of the squad and get stuck into some serious training for the new season
4387556 the one main thing i will take away from this brief visit is that ulster really is a club that knows where it is going and i am looking forward to being part of it i want to add to the team as much as i can

4387564 this is an important agreement for the security of the united states for the security of poland and the security of our nato allies
4387565 in no way is the presidents plan for in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it
4387566 in reality this project has no relation to the iranian missile threat but is aimed against russia
4387567 these installations only worsen the situation we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
4387568 we do take very seriously the concerns of our ally
4387569 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4387570 in five seven or 10 years we want to be sufficiently well equipped and well trained to be ready both with our allies but by ourselves to defend ourselves at a critical moment
4387571 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party
4387572 a new element to take our security agreement to a new level
4387573 i have no indication that russias invasion of georgia at all influenced the negotiations but who knows you can draw your own conclusions
4387574 were facing a new international situation the situation doesnt change our arguments but in my view reinforces them
4387575 there is absolutely no justification for such unfair and excessive prison sentences
4387576 the u s government sadly decided to side with the drug dealer and prosecute agents compean and ramos for simply fulfilling their duties as border patrolmen the drug smuggler walked away from the incident with only a wound in his rear end and the opportunity to attempt another drug run
4387577 the men and women of the border patrol are certainly not above the laws they are empowered to enforce but they must also know that when they apply the necessary and appropriate level of force their government will not work aggressively to ensure they are punished while lawlessness is rewarded
4387578 there is absolutely no justification for such unfair and excessive prison sentences
4387579 i represent the border communities and have for more than 26 years i have worked with the fine men and women of the u s border patrol to ensure they receive the support and resources they need to address the constant intrusion of drug and human smugglers across our borders it troubles me to think that questionable testimony by a drug smuggler who was granted immunity and free medical care for his cooperation was put before the two border patrol agents who willingly accepted this inherently dangerous responsibility
4387580 the very day they surrendered to federal custody i recommended that agents compean and ramos be segregated and was assured they would be removed from the general population and close attention was being paid to their personal safety the attack against agent ramos indicates concerns for his personal safety and protection were ignored
4387581 pardoning agents compean and ramos is the only option available to correct this terrible injustice and just as importantly restoring the confidence of the border patrol and the american people that their nation is serious about enforcing its immigration and smuggling laws

4387588 j k rowlings books had now been shifted to july 17 2009 said the decision was taken to guarantee the studio a major summer blockbuster in 2009 and was partially explained by the which paralyzed the movie industry this year
4387589 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
4387590 we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4387591 the good news for fans is that the gap will now be shortened between half blood prince and the first part of harry potter and the deathly hallows
4387592 weve havent had the same instant success that other bands have had
4387593 these days bands release a single and become the biggest thing in the world for a period of about two years we were never like that with each record weve slowly built up a following and now were at a level where we know we wont be signing at the dole queue any time soon
4387594 i think in many ways were wary of the industry because people cant pigeon hole us were not a rock band were not pop stars were somewhere in between and i like that about us first and foremost i see us as a live band and thats where we really impress take the fuji festival for example some of our critics who listen to our songs say were just another bunch of scousers and just assume were an indie britpop band who would die a death in japan but they loved us
4387595 sometimes i just dont know how we get into these situations
4387596 t4 on the beach was a strange one for us but well play anywhere weve a new album to promote after all
4387597 ill be honest the yanks dont really seem to understand us on record but they do when we play live so we thought wed take a chance and it paid off i would say that though im one of those people who would still be proud of the record even if everyone thought it was sh te
4387598 like splitting up with someone it set us back in a way and moved us forward too i had a little cry about it and im not ashamed to admit it
4387599 i do still miss boyan but thats the way things go sometimes
4387600 paul is a brilliant guitarist and were sounding stronger than ever in many ways its like we were always supposed to sound like this as your readers will probably know we took a bit of time off last year to regroup and it worked out a treat
4387601 obviously i think our version is the best but its almost like its not our song any more its funny because some people actually think we covered an amy track and come up to us and tell us that which is so weird isnt it i just like the fact that theyre both good renditions of a great tune so i dont see the point in complaining
4387602 they started out like we did which was right at the bottom and they slowly worked their way up and thats what we want to do too ill give you an example when we first came to belfast we were in the limelight and now four years later were headlining a festival
4387603 no one can accuse us of taking the easy way to the top weve worked hard for it and when im 65 like mick jagger i want to still be making records with the zutons and playing all over the world

4387626 if they evolved recently they must have passed the ability to metabolise arsenic to each other by lateral gene transfer
4387627 it was quite tricky to culture the critters because if you give them too much arsenic its still toxic even to them but once we had figured out the right dose and gave it to them at regular intervals they flourished on the stuff
4387628 the federal government should not only give the land back to the amarnath shrine board but it should also allot land for the rehabilitation of kashmiri pandits who are forced to live a life of refugees in their own country which is very pathetic i have visited kashmir and i know there is a lot of land there which can be allotted for this purpose
4387629 losing sachin tendulkar at this point of time can be crucial it is very difficult to fill the space when it comes to sachin he not only contributes with the bat and the ball his impact in the dressing room is great

4387635 russias behaviour over the past week has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato
4387636 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4387637 if not in a few months but in few years the border would just be a drawn line through which the people of both nations would be able to cross without any hesitation or hitch
4387638 though pakistan allows peaceniks up to the gate but dreams of dissolving of borders between india and pakistan would be reality in near future
4387639 while doing this we have taken special care of the interests and welfare of our armed forces and paramilitary forces and government employees working at lower levels in our civil services this is one more step in making government more efficient

4387645 it means your organization is really positioned to soar and you dont have to deal with daily dragging down of undefined problems or blame thrown both ways
4387646 agreement on governance up front is probably the thing i see thats missing in most nonprofit organizations
4387647 there are not clearly defined expectations clearly defined roles and responsibilities
4387648 if you have a working board who is going to be involved in the day to day activities of the organization then you probably shouldnt have somebody whose only reason to be on the board is because they want to tell their friends that theyre on the board of this exciting organization youre probably not going to get any work out of them
4387649 that makes sense when the arts organization is in fact an institution if youre dealing with a symphony or a large theater or an opera there youve got a board of directors which establishes the basic mission of that organization which is to provide an art form to the community
4387650 that may not be as appropriate for an organization that is built around the vision of a single artist
4387651 strategic planning and governance can set you free it means your organization is really positioned to soar
4387652 as an artistic director or an executive director essentially the board is your boss
4387653 but you have a lot of say in who those people are and they rely on you a lot to tell you how things are going its a bizarre relationship
4387654 we have an incubator program that houses about 40 emerging organizations none of whom have their 501 c 3 yet probably half of them are focused on doing that and are going towards that goal

4387670 very grateful that we knew him for who he was
4387671 obviously i knew gottlieb he was well known in alpine clubs amp big loss to the community and the guiding community amp gottlieb will be missed said swanson
4387672 gottlieb was well known right out through out new zealand and internationally and well respected
4387673 he was certainly a fabulous man for the area and a good ambassador for lake tekapo as well

4387677 i think the time is perfect for technocrats and particularly bits alumni to enter the field
4387678 not as employees but as founders and management who are the real decision makers and we can involve our friends and well wishers in these projects
4387679 somebody had to make the first move and start the first private engineering college where founders were bitsians
4387680 just imagine the collective impact of say 6 bits pilani campuses and 10 alumni founded colleges after 5 years without doubt this will help make bits pilani as probably the biggest brand for engineering education in india
4387681 we are working on a common structure guidelines and use of a common name which will also help strengthen bits pilani brand obviously these colleges will not use bits name and will be at locations where bits pilani does not plan to open a campus these colleges will take complementary role to bits pilani in all aspects and potential areas for collaboration and cooperation will be soon explored
4387682 and nuva is special because it is the first such college the team is gearing up for conquering next coimbatore and dehradun

4387684 automation is a well established technology both in the manufacturing sector and infrastructure
4387685 the event was part of a recently launched initiative by aia called
4387686 that while the concept of industry academia partnership is picking up with tifacs mission reach initiative industry must realise that the primary role of academia is to encourage innovation our educational centres of excellence should be developed to create new applications rather than be seen as a low cost substitute to solve routine technical problems
4387687 the association has also taken initiatives to foster best practices within the automation industry by encouraging innovation to promote the cause of indian industry now we are turning our attention to upgrade the way automation is taught and learnt in colleges

4387708 the west i e the united states has spent a lot of time energy and money to teach georgia the tricks of the trade to make the country look like a democracy we see through this deceit we understand that the seditious tactics of the so called color revolutions are a real threat to international law and the source of global nihilism
4387709 we are convinced that our remaining in berlin is essential to our prestige in germany and in europe whether for good or bad it has become a symbol of the american intent
4387710 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint

4387727 another reminder that illegal activity at our border is still a major problem in our country
4387728 the men and women of our border patrol are knowingly putting their lives at risk
4387729 these are the people who are on the front lines of our effort to keep our country secure and they should have our full support this incident also highlights the need to finish the san diego border fence project which provides our agents with another layer of protection on what is clearly a dangerous border
4387730 this entrenchment mentality along with a willingness to engage our officers has resulted in an escalation in violence and assaults against border patrol agents
4387731 our agents are trained equipped and prepared to take appropriate actions when confronted with assaultive actions split second decisions must be made by our officers in responding to threats and the means by which to engage the threats that they face in protecting our nations borders
4387732 is up to the individual agent and his or her perception of the danger or physical harm that he or she faces

4387738 is the xlr worthy of the attention that its striking lines so easily attract our initial impressions were a resounding yes
4387739 but after spending the better part of a week behind the wheel we realized that while the xlr has a look that sets it apart from the crowd it still has a ways to go before it can match its european rivals when it comes to delivering a complete package of style performance and refinement

4387741 we used to think air pollution was a problem that primarily affects the lungs we now know it is also bad for the heart
4387742 there doesnt have to be an environmental catastrophe for air pollution to cause injury were talking about very modest increases air pollution can be dangerous at levels that are within the accepted air quality standards
4387743 patients with cardiovascular disease shouldnt exercise outside on days with increased air pollution levels on very polluted days they should consider staying inside and during the winter they should limit exposure to fireplace smoke

4387762 the current high revenue growth rate in the market is related to soaring prices the prices of fatty alcohols have risen by more than 30 0 per cent following the surge in raw material natural oils and crude oil prices
4387763 the push for quality enhancements has also underlined market expansion
4387764 the increased imports of fatty alcohols from asia and china in particular are intensifying the degree of competition in the industry
4387765 these imported fatty alcohols are quite often of higher quality but are available at lower prices
4387766 leading fatty alcohols manufacturers are devising effective competitive strategies to retain their edge
4387767 these include investing in research and development and promoting novel technologies

4387778 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4387779 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4387780 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4387781 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4387782 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4387783 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw

4387788 what happened is unprecedented since the end of the cold war
4387789 in the situation that has evolved as a result of the russian georgian conflict the question is whether the international community will be strong wise and considerate enough to make it clear that existing conflicts cannot be settled in ways that are unacceptable in the 21st century
4387790 what the russians are saying now is not at all different from what they said about hungary in 1956

4387838 for indeed because of the time being due to be teachers yet you need for the one to teach you again what are the rudiments of the beginning of the words of god and you have become ones having need of milk and not of solid food
4387839 for the grace of god that brings salvation has appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present age looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great god and savior jesus christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for himself his own special people zealous for good works titus 2 11 14 nkj

4387845 i sent you one who would seek you out walk with you and forgive you so he had feet to walk with and hands to forgive with thus when he ascended after his resurrection he showed hands side and feet hands with which he gave pardon to sinners and side from which flowed the ransom of the redeemed

4387882 csak amikor magamhoz nyultam akkor vettem eszre hogy az a kek szar ami rajta van igencsak fog szep kek lett a teny
4387883 generally we played well those first two games but losses are always losses and there is always a fear that we dont recover
4387884 any time that we have yao on the floor and he is healthy and able to play we feel confident
4387885 our perimeter shooters opened a lot of room for me
4387886 they knocked down every open shot in the first three games i cannot let them down i have to do something
4387887 but the second quarter we played too casual we played without discipline we didnt battle for rebounds
4387888 we relaxed too much we started thinking that game was over but i remember too well that this season that we have played angola twice the first game we lost and the second game we had some problems
4387889 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting one in the first place
4387890 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago
4387891 so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away
4387892 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4387893 we have a wealth of talent within our party and very limited speaking roles
4387894 its hard to imagine why anyone would treat the chairman of the house ways and means committee this way especially if you have pledged in your campaign to do a major tax overhaul
4387895 in terms of getting elected obama could proably afford to ignore rangel or not bring him into the fold but in terms of governing he cant
4387896 all of my experiences with the obama apeople are that they have reached out they have opened the door they have encouraged you to come through
4387897 i dont see any situation where theyre putting any clinton supporters down
4387898 you can drink easier knowing that organic spirits come from ingredients raised without pesticides or petroleum based fertilizers which can end up in your glass
4387899 it does make sense given that youre drinking pure products
4387900 but no one s ever done anything like youre about to
4387901 did her own hair and makeup and made us turkey sandwiches for lunch
4387902 i try on a lot of lingerie and veto a lot of it
4387903 an attempt was made by and on behalf of my husband to first prevent my entry into our home and then later to make me leave our home by force i shall continue to assist the police force with its inquiries
4387904 no we didnt break in she was at her home someone bit her it mightve been michael or his sister but there was shoving and someone bit her on the shoulder
4387905 lisaraye is nothing more than a gold digger she wants a cash settlement upwards of several million dollars
4387906 thats what she should be doing she deserves spousal support she hasnt been going on auditions and things so she devoted her time to him and hasnt been working as much its not like shes coming in like rocsi just being on bet
4387907 vicky cristina penelope cruz that elevate allens melancholy thoughts on love and relationships
4387908 its not been a good week for sterling but today its more of a strong dollar story
4387909 clearly the bank of england inflation report on wednesday triggered the latest round of selling this week and theres an increasingly probability that the boe could cut rates this year and will almost certainly continue to cut through 2009
4387910 every decent man is ashamed of the government he lives under
4387911 we will literally go right back into contract negotiations in another month or so
4387912 so you dont have to get everything you might want in a one year deal when you know youre going right back for a multiyear deal
4387913 while we do not embrace this contract we accept this contract as a way to break the stalemate
4387914 we are realistic we are recognizing the citys position financially i do think people will be disappointed
4387915 i believe we now have the critical momentum to find a new way of providing high quality care at the lowest possible cost
4387916 they bought time and they paid somewhat of a premium for it
4387917 the issue now is will the time be well spent and provide results that benefit the city the union and the taxpayers
4387918 delegate to the victims their counsel or the courts the responsibility of the executive branch to make americas foreign policy response to acts of terrorism
4387919 i have great respect for this panel but i could not disagree more with their analysis or reasoning
4387920 it just seems to be totally wrong to us to have a decision be made on who gets immunity and who does or does not get immunity based not on law but because of political decisions made by the diplomatic corps
4387921 we believe that the court was wrong in its interpretation of the law
4387922 under the courts rationale were a new yorker to be sideswiped by a car driven by an employee of the saudi embassy they could sue for bumps and bruises yet nearly 3 000 families of those innocents who were brutally killed in lower manhattan cannot pursue their claims
4387923 if you are selling in neighborhoods where there is one foreclosure or several there is serious competitive pressure
4387924 sending a message that philadelphia can once again be the greatest city in this country
4387925 like a vandal going into an art museum and splashing paint on a sculpture
4387926 provide any tangible benefit for people who are exposed to germs in crowded places
4387927 we will vigorously defend ourselves against this complaint as we believe that we worked in the best interests of our investor and issuer clients this complaint attempts to link a single client interaction with overall market conditions which affected all student loan issuers and as such we believe there is no basis for these specific allegations
4387928 we need to get the revenue up beyond the cost of operating our business
4387929 it means we sell out of styles very quickly that means people cant wait for markdowns
4387930 people want to feel a little bit good about themselves and about life in general
4387931 were going to get going as soon as we are authorized to do so we dont have a timetable yet were putting together our schedule now
4387932 my instincts are that brian oneill is a tough guy with a lot of staying power
4387933 its a hit but its not the bigger part of his portfolio by any means
4387934 was a very good amenity for our projects it was good and we certainly hope it will be rebuilt
4387935 in addition to the obvious economic benefits of assuring that this project is completed this vote punctuates the integrity of both our process and of our role of overseeing legalized gaming in the commonwealth
4387936 they should not be believed mr bluhm has already proven not to be credible
4387937 they dont have political support in philadelphia to build a casino
4387938 mr heiko your three minutes are up and your baby appears to be unhappy
4387939 when you walk in the front door and check in you can expect to have pretty much the same experience that people had when they gathered here for a vacation 140 years ago
4387940 when people are booking reservations these are things they ask for
4387941 i dont think these are requests we can ignore but i think we can make these additions without changing the character the ambience of the hotel
4387942 if we were to go in and add insulation and everything else that goes with adding a heating system we would completely change the soul the character of the old building
4387943 preservation of this 132 year old marvel of a building is an ongoing process
4387944 we fell in love with her so many years ago and are delighted her welfare will continue with bob mullocks leadership
4387945 people come to cape may for the history of the town and the people who choose to stay here understand that where they are staying is as important as the destination
4387946 create an authentic experience here that has nothing to do with the outside world and theyre doing that in a very organic way that isnt contrived
4387947 people always say they feel like theyre coming home when they come here to stay
4387948 while some of them live paycheck to paycheck our customers represent broad income segments and they are all challenged today
4387949 we have improved customer traffic and overall sales growth in our markets
4387950 while inflation and higher fuel costs are pressuring suppliers retailers and customers worldwide were confident that wal mart is well positioned for this economy
4387951 let me tell you how honored i am that you used my fathers name for your column
4387952 well that column got me fired and i think eventually shut down the magazine
4387953 well if you are going to do something might as well do it right
4387954 but unfortunately my boss was in court today because of me
4387955 i wrote an episode where one of the main characters could not afford hospital care but needed a necessary surgery in a private hospital the private hospital would not admit him so we killed him off it caused an uproar
4387956 but sometimes people dont want the truth and somebody has opened a charge against us in court saying we are misconstruing the facts
4387957 obama is coming obama is coming and then somebody else it was spreading like wildfire
4387958 they all went into the water and the security service was around them they all went in the water lifeguards and they all went snorkeling
4387959 we saw a lot of police and the secret service so we knew something was going on and it was barack obama here at the u s memorial pretty exciting
4387960 i just said if i could please have your autograph and he said yeah sure okay and he tried to rush because he had to go
4387961 i know he wanted to come over here on vacation but the timing was a little tough because he ran into a problem with the world affairs its kind of hard hes a little bit out of the loop
4387962 it gives me a lot of confidence that they want me and its comforting to know im with them
4387963 in talking about features before understanding of them is solid
4387964 hes a star most kids wont be able to meet
4387965 i started playing rec soccer when i was 6 or 7 years old
4387966 its really awesome playing on a field where a bunch of other stars played
4387967 a county must review its entire comprehensive plan every seven years
4387968 however the gma does not explicitly require a county to revise every aspect of its comprehensive plan and we refuse to imply such an onerous requirement
4387969 some certainty that their land uses wont be influenced by a state body that isnt aligned with the local circumstances and values
4387970 those are important because theyre going to protect the puget sound water quality and the rural character
4387971 the high court agreed with us on whether the urban growth area was constrained by state office of financial management population projections and that the county couldnt count forest and agricultural lands as part of its rural element
4387972 appears to clear the way for getting back to the bottom up system that was originally promised under the growth management act
4387973 if you reduce the amount of buildable property costs go up
4387974 there are a lot of numbers statistics that we could talk about in his career
4387975 but there are several components that are more important than stats as to why were so excited in bringing kasey back one of them is character
4387976 i hope to be a part of this team not just for two years ill be playing but for 10 20 years after that
4387977 id love to work my way up and be a part of the sounders for life
4387978 ive been a fan of kaseys for his entire career
4387979 im proud to be involved in the process to bring his family back to seattle
4387980 im absolutely sure kasey will be an excellent ambassador for this franchise
4387981 kasey has experience around the world in the locker room that experience is paramount kasey is a natural leader
4387982 i said from day one when i left for europe that one day i wanted to come home and play
4387983 i always said i wanted to play in america ive been close several times
4387984 i always said i might as well stay in europe
4387985 but its not just to bring my family home and settle in the northwest
4387986 im coming home to play im coming to help this team establish itself as one of the top teams in the country
4387987 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control and it would ratify their continuing engagement with the military force until everything is worked out but it doesnt say that the forces will be replaced
4387988 the russians dont need much justification to do pretty much what they want theyve shown that theyve got a free hand here anyway but any legal justification that can help will always be used
4387989 they russians are taking fuller control of the region and creating a situation where they get the georgians out so they get little leverage on which to negotiate the future status of the regions
4387990 anything allowing russia to be in gori is clearly not useful or acceptable for georgians
4387991 georgians do have an interest in provocation and need to be kept under control
4387992 because the incentive for the georgians is to have the russians do nasty things which will then help their bargaining with the outside world
4387993 its been like this as far as i can remember we build houses then fighting occurs we leave and return home and build our houses again
4387994 being alive after all the troubles just makes me thankful despite the difficulties
4387995 for the first time in my life i was amazed by the mastery with which putin is able to hold onto power
4387996 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located we wont allow the deaths of our compatriots go unpunished
4387997 in any case i think this too is an indirect indication of who is more important in this ruling tandem
4387998 you see thugs differ from normal people in that when they smell blood its hard for them to stop
4387999 otherwise people would begin to call into question his ability to run the country and accuse him of being spineless
4388000 the political process can always be looked at either through a telescope or a microscope
4388001 if you look up close of course much is changing but if you take the longer view it turns out that the system was totalitarian and continues to be totalitarian
4388002 gottlieb was one of the most incredible people i have ever seen
4388003 internationally speaking its a strategic nomination because he is pro european and he knows how brussels works
4388004 this is the first baby step for christopher neil in terms of having him held accountable for the international sex crimes he is accused of committing
4388005 the world will be watching to see if there is the political will to continue on with this case
4388006 to continue with the process of change in democracy and peace
4388007 the bolivian government is going to guarantee autonomy for all of bolivia but within a framework of legality and constitutionality
4388008 i feel the opposing governors only want the silver money and do not wish to deal with other matters without considering what the bolivian people think
4388009 i conclude that the bolivian people want autonomy they want a new political constitution
4388010 now no governor can talk about two thirds more than two thirds of the people want to unite the new constitution with the statutes for autonomy
4388011 terrorism extremism communalism and fundamentalism have emerged as major challenges to the unity and integrity of our country
4388012 in this hour of crisis divisive politics will lead us nowhere i appeal to all political parties to keep the long term interests of jammu and kashmir in view and come together to find a permanent solution to the problems of the state
4388013 the inflation we have seen this year is basically due to external factors
4388014 it may be one of the nicest places in the world to live in but it has become a symbol
4388015 on setting up diplomatic relations between the two countries at the level of ambassadors
4388016 one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4388017 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
4388018 to reactivate the work of the joint committee to demarcate the lebanese syrian borders within a mechanism and a set of priorities
4388019 it is not possible to mark the borders in shebaa farms as long as there is still israeli occupation the occupation must end
4388020 to activate and step up the work of the joint committee on people missing from both countries
4388021 at this stage the way the weather forecast is looking it maybe early tomorrow saturday before the helicopters can get in there
4388022 the prime minister never offered to absorb 20 000 refugees in israel the prime minister again reiterates that under any future agreement there will not be any return of palestinian refugees to israel in any number

4388048 lymphoma was the first malignancy in which antibodies were shown to be effective treatment
4388049 these exciting preliminary results come from using them to harness the bodys own immune responses in a new way
4388050 although the side effects need to be monitored carefully we hope that this type of treatment will prove to be effective in larger trials in the future
4388051 we are not planning to let anyone in anymore more than 18 000 south ossetian refugees who live in georgia fled and are now in north ossetia we need them to return to south ossetia
4388052 should we let them return so they can shoot us in the back again and humiliate our people the president said adding that a south ossetian border had been established
4388053 it is a consequence of any war any aggression we are treating all cases severely
4388054 only russian peacekeepers will be allowed in south ossetia and abkhazia
4388055 there will be no georgian peacekeepers on south ossetian territory
4388056 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
4388057 we certainly welcome the development we believe that missile defense is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
4388058 loyalty to the u s and receive material benefits for the americans it is an opportunity to expand its military presence across the world including closer to russia
4388059 this is an additional risk many nato countries are unhappy with this including the germans and the french
4388060 there might be a psychological element in it but talks with poland had been dragging on long enough beforehand
4388061 to be honest i have no desire to comment on the situation
4388062 whats happened has happened everyone has their ups and downs im not ready yet to talk about my future
4388063 we are holding talks with tottenham right now and most likely well have some news on friday evening
4388064 i just wanted to step on it the first 50 a little bit and try to get out to an early lead
4388065 i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4388066 if phelps wasnt in this sport i dont think i would be as good just because hes up there and i just want to become better than him
4388067 he pushes me in practice in everything i can say that without him i wouldnt be where i am right now
4388068 it was my first individual olympic gold medal i touched the wall and i was just like thank you finally i felt really good the whole way
4388069 for ryan to come back 20 minutes later and just having us miss going 1 2 its a pretty incredible swim its a pretty incredible day for him im glad to see him get his first gold its a cool moment i know hes happy
4388070 ryan swum a wonderful race and i swum the best race i could possibly swim im proud of what i did but he swam a beautiful race and im proud of him
4388071 it just happened and it felt great i just tried to stay relaxed and not rush through the water just keep my strokes strong and power through them
4388072 i think you can expect to see us gold medal competitive in about eight events which is phenomenal
4388073 and because of the previous performances at the world championships we are odds on favourite and whichever way you look at it you cant avoid that
4388074 its a combination of money the right people the best equipment and just a very positive mentality
4388075 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4388076 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4388077 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4388078 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4388079 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4388080 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4388081 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw

4388083 some of my classmates push me outside the door before their religion class others ask me why am i not orthodox the same way the priest had asked my parents
4388084 god helps me forgive them but i dont like these jokes
4388085 religious education here indoctrinates fuelling prejudice against other faiths and against sexual minorities
4388086 but its more than this teaching children to discriminate against something builds a national mentality and in the end people reject differences and discriminate against everything
4388087 credibly asserted that authorities pressured children of other faiths to attend classes of orthodox religion
4388088 religious and sexual discrimination are not a problem of the schools as far as i know all religions say their god is the greatest and almost all disagree with homosexuality and we cant change peoples faiths
4388089 the values offered by religious education are needed desperately in times of aggressive and materialist individualism

4388096 er is een crisis op de aandelenmarkten deze wordt gecombineerd met de angst voor een recessie en banken die hun balansen aan het leegpompen zijn omdat ze miljarden hebben afgeboekt ik loop al lang mee maar dit is een heel nieuwe ervaring
4388097 er zit meer dan zes maanden tijd in dit onderzoek
4388098 ze hebben de keus of ze zich willen aanmelden voor ons beveiligingsonderzoek of hun onderzoeksteams willen inzetten om de kwetsbaarheden zelf te onderzoeken

4388104 theres no question that the resource plays in saskatchewan and british columbia are big widespread stuff and i hear its even bigger than we think
4388105 i cant quantify it but i think it has to be viewed favourably by bc hydro
4388106 there were lots of people who walked on and then there was a long fight and after that we got independence
4388107 one thats in a coma is a daughter of a neighbour a few houses down we know them all
4388108 its very very difficult on a lot of people it will basically shut down the community for a few days especially around the funeral time
4388109 i dont know her personally very well theyve been in the community for a while but theyre not from the community
4388110 we cant really determine what the cause of the collision is at this time
4388111 our reconstructionist is on the scene and hes gathering all the information that he can so that we can try and make a determination as to what happened
4388112 one stopped and actually went into the dugout and pulled one of the victims out of the car and brought the person to shore

4388114 the uniqueness of our program is that we not only embrace eastern and western philosophies but we try to integrate the traditions of new mexico
4388115 to achieve one goal of health and wellness in our patients
4388116 thats different from a place where you can sense healing right from the beginning
4388117 we want to know them as a person instead of just a patient who came in with a medical problem
4388118 if they find a crisped laptop i hope they can retrieve the hard drive
4388119 i honestly dont know how they got him you get your loved ones and life goes on
4388120 the greater fear right now is missing the next big rally
4388121 the fact that the market has not sold off with any strength investors are saying hey lets go ahead and buy

4388125 some people might be surprised to know that it is a crime to take plants from the countryside but these orchids are a much a part of our heritage as a painting in an art gallery and deserve protection too
4388126 the actions of the thieves have damaged a nationally important wildlife site and put a rare plant under threat
4388127 orchids are popular flowers but it is important that they are left to flourish in their natural environment in this case the limestone area of the white peak

4388130 one of the big problems they now face in other countries is the people in power want to reserve the money keep it for themselves so they exclude young able people who want to join their team
4388131 the result is there is no talent inside the existing parties
4388132 in other countries elections do not put up a division one team they are a division three either a b team or a c team in charge in singapore we carefully select our candidates
4388133 over the years with each election we see the quality of the mps their education levels their competence their abilities their energy
4388134 their youthfulness is renewed and we have a leadership thats able to meet the rising standards of the population
4388135 they say oh lets have multiparty politics lets have different parties change and be in charge of the government is it that simple you vote in a division three government not a division one government and the whole economy will just subside within three four years finished
4388136 and a amp apos freewheeling paress has not cleaed up corruption although according to american amp apos liberal democracy theories it is designed to do so
4388137 why are we on top of our problem because theres a government thats planning ahead seeing ahead calculating ahead making the right decision yes there will be recession around the world but we will have enough investments already going on
4388138 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier

4388140 den meget st rke mand som mussolini ubetinget er er netop hvad det misregerede italienske folk tr nger til
4388141 nu ved v lgerne at folkestyret er forvandlet til et rent partistyre uden hvilket saglige hensyn skubbes til side for de partipolitiske og derfor kan man g ud fra at et flertal af v lgerne oprigtigt nsker diktaturet som den eneste udvej til sunde forhold i statsstyret

4388143 det tyske diktatur betyder s ledes b de en fordel og en fare for europa en fordel fordi der derved er rejst et st rkt bolv rk mod kommunismen og socialdemokratiet p samme tid er blevet sat grundigt p plads og en fare fordi det forel big ikke kan undg at for ge sp ndingen og nerv siteten for en ny krig
4388144 mussolini reddede italien fra den kommunistiske syndflod som et udueligt parlamentarisk styre havde gjort det modent til og ingen kan vel bestride at hans diktatur har v ret en velgerning for det italienske folk
4388145 naar man har fulgt j desp rgsmaalet i europa i aartier kan man til en vis grad forstaa tyskernes animositet overfor j derne ogsaa hvis man ser bort fra de raceteorier der betyder saa meget i den nationalsocialistiske verdensopfattelse vi ved at titusinder af j der ford mmer de j diske forretningshajer de j diske pornografispekulanter og de j diske terrorister men alligevel kan det ikke ben gtes at de erfaringer som tyskerne som mange andre fastlands folk har gjort med hensyn til j derne danner en vis basis for deres forf lgelser man maa indr mme tyskland at det har ret til at skille sig af med sine j der

4388151 i still believe there is a greater than 50 per cent probability of recession
4388152 i learned fast you cant sell to cowboys they have no money

4388155 wir wussten dass lech pozna ber viel potenzial verf gt unser gegner hat uns in beiden halbzeiten dominiert und auch in dieser h he verdient gewonnen unsere junge mannschaft ist international noch nicht reif

4388157 if she does her personal best in each event shes going to score 6 543 and i would take my chances on that it statistically would be sufficient for at least a bronze
4388158 my start was pretty good i just got out pretty well and just didnt hit it as hard going into the end because its the first round so i wanted to save a little energy for the quarter finals
4388159 shes 100 per cent healthy its no problem with her health she did feel some pressure earlier in the year but shes physically fitter than ever
4388160 you dont have to be an economist to predict that prices will go down in saskatoon and regina but in terms of the fundamentals all the pieces there are still fine a healthy economy energy boom and rising food prices
4388161 other than people who bought last year thinking prices would keep doubling over breakfast most people there western canada should still end up ahead
4388162 the concern here is that the potential decline in ontario would not reflect overshooting but instead the further slowing of an economy that is probably already in recession
4388163 while i would expect a more modest drop in prices of about 5 per cent in ontario and the gta prices have not risen as much here and the decline would be more painful
4388164 we have established a reputation for backing companies with strong management teams and good growth prospects
4388165 so the one departure in the sleep country and fastfrate investments is that we are partners with funds that will eventually need to exit
4388166 its kind of my getaway from coaching and that sort of thing
4388167 hes got a great car and something to be proud of
4388168 its wonderful that all of a sudden after people like joe who spend three four or more years getting their cars restored to see them take them to car shows around the country
4388169 my grandfather had a 1929 essex but it was damaged in an accident
4388170 he bought the new one apparently over grandmas objection because he also bought a puppy about the same time maybe to appease her
4388171 it got so i could fix it too at times we would just put in a new valve and away shed go
4388172 when i got it it had been on blocks in grandmas garage since 1952
4388173 my dad had ripped off the roof and all of the interior but didnt get much further than that
4388174 i put some seat covers over the torn out seats put the interior sides back in it and in 1978 slapped a coat of paint on it to keep it from rusting away
4388175 maybe its because of michigan state hes an msu graduate and the irish the delaney heritage
4388176 the 1930 essex has a lot better lines and features than say the model a ford model
4388177 it makes me happy to see how happy families are when they restore an old family car
4388178 can you imagine driving back to boston every year in this with the roads as they were then
4388179 to let this government govern or to let the people decide
4388180 im telling mr dion he should decide for good and soon
4388181 i think quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4388182 we have seen increasing signs that this parliament is really not working well anymore it is increasingly dysfunctional
4388183 other legislation that is obstructed in the house of commons principally by mr dion
4388184 we have a committee system that is increasingly in chaos
4388185 ultimately in a minority parliament to get things done you have to have the support of at least one of the other opposition parties
4388186 the obstruction and the dysfunctionality comes entirely from the conservatives themselves
4388187 a prison with cells all in a row semi detached torture chambers
4388188 i had some incredible times here back in the day
4388189 the americans didnt know what to do with me so they sent me to london i guess black white jewish and rocknroll dont go together
4388190 autoridades antidoping estimularam uma cultura esportiva de suspeita segredo e medo
4388191 h uma possibilidade de que os atletas nesta olimp ada usem essas drogas
4388192 encorajaria um uso de drogas mais racional e informado no esporte amador levando a um decl nio geral na taxa de problemas de sa de associados ao doping
4388193 em escassas evid ncias contaminadas por uma motiva o moralista de proteger o esporte

4388197 the only thing we have to fear is fear itself and oh yeah bankrupt boosters who can no longer afford their luxury suites
4388198 people dont have the discretionary dollars that theyve had in the past to spend on sports
4388199 we understand that if you have to make a choice on whether to spend money on a sporting event or put food on the table and provide shelter for your family youre going to choose the latter
4388200 people that have come to the games in the past now may stay home and watch on television
4388201 some colleges seem more focused on beer and spectacle than teaching and learning
4388202 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4388203 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4388204 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4388205 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4388206 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4388207 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4388208 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4388209 i love all kinds of art and i love music i enjoy rap hip hop reggae reggaeton and soul music i have to listen to it everywhere i go i draw and paint too but i dont have much time for that im into computers and sometimes if i have a little time i like to play computer games i like to watch the simpsons and south park on tv my life has become very busy since i started to model for score people ask me how i became a score model i discovered score when i answered their website beascoremodel com
4388210 karina hart has ruined me for all other women her breasts are perfect and the curve of her hips and ass are absolutely divine miss hart is perfectly proportioned from top to bottom while your pictures are a good start this is a woman who should have her likeness immortalized in marble she is far and away the most incredible model i have ever laid eyes on and definitely a future member of the pantheon of greats thank you for bringing us this truly tremendous discovery she already has my vote for newcomer of the year
4388211 where in the world did you find that beautiful angel karina hart
4388212 no one can afford to miss the musings of the chatty jancis
4388213 saya sering emosional sehingga seringkali pula membuat kesalahan yang berakibat permainan tidak berkembang dengan baik
4388214 emosi ketika melakukan pertandingan saya masih perlu diperbaiki dan diharapkan akan membaik dalam kesempatan mendatang
4388215 saya berharap bisa bermain lebih bagus sehingga bisa meraih perunggu
4388216 lan lu juga masih suka emosi ketika bertanding semoga saya bisa mengambil kesempatan dari situ
4388217 with income being squeezed in so many ways those looking to raise some extra money may find that their spare room could provide the answer
4388218 demand is likely to be fairly high with the government providing tax free incentives
4388219 there is no evidence that the public asked for crossrail
4388220 im hungover and im lying in a pool of effluent from here a mccain presidency looks pretty good
4388221 with news most of it negative emanating on a daily basis borrowers could be forgiven for not knowing whether to fix track cap or offset
4388222 so borrowers will immediately see less coming from their wage packet if they arranged a new tracker now over a fixed rate

4388235 die katastrophale klimapolitik von bm pr ll wird f r uns alle sehr teuer werden
4388236 sterreich ist schlusslicht im klimaschutz in europa und ist mehr als 30 prozent vom kyoto ziel entfernt
4388237 bm pr ll versteht unter klimaschutz nichtstun im inland aber daf r zertifikate im ausland zu kaufen und auf die strafzahlungen zu warten
4388238 f r hei e luft und ohne inl ndische wertsch pfung
4388239 wir brauchen konsequenten klimaschutz und investitionen in die energiewende in ober sterreich das stoppt die teuerung f r die menschen und die wirtschaft und schafft arbeitspl tze in unserem land
4388240 das miserable kostromgesetz wird weiterhin den ausbau der erneuerbaren energien in ober sterreich blockieren
4388241 wir brauchen ein kostromgesetz mit 20 jahren f rderdauer abnahmegarantie und faire tarife damit sch tzen wir unser klima schaffen arbeitspl tze in ober sterreich und werden unabh ngig von teurem l und gas

4388266 we want the tools we develop to be truly useful in the real world
4388267 when developing new products we always follow a clear principle we look at everyday life and current usage models of our customers anticipate future trends and needs and then blend the best available technology with software intelligence to simplify their future this time we came up with something really special the aspire one an internet device that delivers true mobile and a seamless wireless experience for all online users
4388268 the acer aspire one netbook designed for internet use will help drive growth in the exciting new netbook category

4388270 our role as government is to guarantee that the infrastructure will be in place and this is what we are doing how the broadcasters secure bandwidth and what they pay for it is a commercial arrangement with which we don t have anything to do
4388271 telkom will be the primary link between the stadiums and the international broadcast centre however there is no monopoly on getting the signal out of the country we are on track to be operational by june 2009
4388272 we government are only providing fibre optic connections from the nearest telkom exchanges to the stadia
4388273 this web site will provide information on health preparations health promotion information travel medicine and will be a platform for applications by health volunteers
4388274 government has pledged to subsidise set top boxes for more than four million houses but what we are worried about is that after the migration has taken place in three years time those tv sets they own might not be able to interpret the converted analogue signal
4388275 if you look at how the set top boxes work they basically receive the digital signal and convert it into an analogue signal so i see no way that present digital will become obsolete in the near future
4388276 by 1 november 2011 any household still using an analogue television without a digital decoder will not be able to watch any tv stations
4388277 obamas campaign aides have emphasized his strong christian beliefs and downplayed any islamic connection the illinois senator was raised in a secular household in indonesia by his stepfather and mother his chief spokesman robert gibbs said in a statement in january after false reports began circulating that obama had attended a radical madrasa or koranic school as a child to be clear senator obama has never been a muslim was not raised a muslim and is a committed christian who attends the united church of christ in chicago gibbs jan 24 statement said

4388279 the brownstones design works well with enhanced density and brings unique flair to the product giving it fantastic street appeal
4388280 usually in highly urban lifestyles you have to compromise your outdoor space but these homes have rooftop decks on virtually all units between 500 and 600 square feet most with mountain views to the north
4388281 this is a desirable lifestyle location that is self supporting has its own community and is still affordably priced
4388282 the area is geographically proximate to vancouver and richmond and it sits on the beltline right above the border so its easy to cross to the east and go to surrey cloverdale langley new west or burnaby
4388283 this is a vibrant urban style product that is in the suburbs and it appeals to anyone who is trying to get more value without paying vancouver prices
4388284 the existing measures currently in force at cfb esquimalt are considered adequate and appropriate for the current security climate
4388285 the motor vehicle incident of last night has not changed our security posture in any way
4388286 in serious or sensitive service and criminal offences against property persons and the department of national defence
4388287 theres no barrier or physical impediments to coming on the base its sort of a voluntary checkpoint people are just asked to show i d at the gate
4388288 both vanoc and john furlong and we the government of b c are very interested in working together to showcase the best of food and wines from b c
4388289 theres been no advantage in being a b c producer in supplying the olympics its a little frustrating that more is not being done to promote locally grown produce
4388290 our members are really anxious to seize on the opportunities from the olympics
4388291 one of the biggest issues in quebec was that people werent recognizing that people were getting sick with this disease early enough and there was transmission happening within the hospital
4388292 the same thing was happening in ontario and occasionally we have seen it out here
4388293 we have had some cases of that strain here and it is very likely that some of these cases were
4388294 we can tell very rapidly whether a person is infected with a toxin secreting strain of c difficile
4388295 but to find the genetic code to see if it has the part of the gene that causes it to be a hyper secreting strain takes a long time
4388296 its just so easy to transmit infections between people not just c diff
4388297 sars really made it hit home that there was transmission between people in multi bed rooms and to people coming in to visit them
4388298 as theyre watching the whales the commercial vessel plowed right through
4388299 his explanation was that in his home of origin there are stories of whales capsizing boats
4388300 im quite pleased that this incident went to court and a conviction was handed down
4388301 dfo has put a lot of effort forward with species at risk to identify threats and mitigate those incidents
4388302 this is a home made for character enthusiasts needing space
4388303 it has a rare 64 by 130 foot lot and a home that has been lovingly updated with todays modern touches plus tons of classic charm
4388304 given the growth in newspaper circulation in asia the loss of a significant portion of the asian market to foreign producers is disconcerting for b c newsprint producers
4388305 theyd come in a special box and everything marked in the fashion with the olympic committee logo in some type of tasteful manner
4388306 its been a tradition for dale of norway to do a knitwear program thats associated with the winter olympics
4388307 its really just an extension of our brand itself theres a connection there that we try to support as best we can
4388308 were closing in on the finish line were probably going to see about 45 licensees when its all said and done
4388309 certainly we wouldnt want any offensive type of a product because they dont line up with our visions or values
4388310 but its not even necessarily that its offensive or inappropriate its one that might not mirror up to our games
4388311 weve been approached with people who wanted to do you know soccer balls or that type of thing but really we wanted to stick to winter games more
4388312 the attorney general asks that the appeal be heard as soon as there is available time to hear it
4388313 the implications are significant what were talking about is an order declaring an important law of no force and effect
4388314 the government should be doing their work as we speak
4388315 the civil liberties association like the plaintiffs themselves is responding to what in essence is a health care crisis in the downtown eastside

4388317 lotta people think the gold around here was all gobbled up a century ago
4388318 they dont understand ill find you gold in five minutes
4388319 oh yeah people still get the fever so bad man they can taste it
4388320 first you want to shake it around with lots of water
4388321 the gold is 19 times heavier than water and it all sinks to the bottom you mostly find really fine flour gold around here
4388322 we havent gone as far as getting a claim yet maybe when the kids leave home
4388323 as soon as gold goes above 600 an ounce people start blanket claiming the entire province
4388324 they make it pretty easy if you have a gps and an internet link you can do it all online from the bush
4388325 i get out there about two months of the year
4388326 if the right opportunity struck id be out there full time youd see a gone prospecting sign in the window
4388327 if im going through princeton i always stop by the pub and buy the old timers a round some are tight lipped but you never know what they might tell you
4388328 the old guys probably sitting on 35 to 50 million there
4388329 you hear stories like that and it keeps you going yknow the early prospectors only took about 25 per cent of this provinces gold wealth according to mineral surveys that means three quarters is still out there waiting for you and me
4388330 the worst day prospecting on a creek beats the best day at the office
4388331 every spring that snow melts and pushes the gold off the mountains and down the streams
4388332 that means every year you got a fresh crop of gold in there not too many people know that
4388333 there it is colour in the pan like the stars in the sky
4388334 they sign an agreement that as long as they commit to the program the program commits back to them
4388335 it is a goal i think my chances are up to me
4388336 then again when youre racing against time injury also comes into play because youre pushing yourself to go bigger and do bigger tricks faster than you normally would
4388337 were just working one step at a time hopefully eventually getting to that dream of the olympics it would be great to represent my area of the world here and show people that it can be done
4388338 when i was younger this kind of opportunity didnt exist so the program cut a lot of costs for me that were really hard to get by i loved snowboarding so much it was my escape from home reality
4388339 i was in a small town i couldnt stand living there any more and i was ready to move out i had to finish my secondary school and chelsie helped me understand that

4388341 home prices are dropping to a point where the cost of a mortgage and taxes equals rent
4388342 one sovereign fund said to have earmarked 29 billion to purchase foreclosed residential real estate recently hired a west coast mortgage broker and is starting to search for bargains
4388343 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4388344 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4388345 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4388346 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4388347 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4388348 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4388349 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4388350 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4388351 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4388352 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4388353 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4388354 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4388355 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4388360 i think they the zimbabwean government are sending a clear message to president thabo mbeki the sadc the african union the united nations that says look you people are forcing us into dialogue with the mdc but we are not interested
4388361 when the talks broke off on tuesday it became clear that not everyone in zanu pf wants the deal
4388362 the leak of negotiating documents to the state press is another indication the documents were leaked by a member of the cabinet we also expect violence
4388363 they have approached an extensive number of our members of parliament asking them to submit their cvs and asking them to be part of mugabes mendacious and dishonest government
4388364 todays music demands accurate bass reproduction to ensure mixes remain punchy and powerful

4388366 i would have liked to have had the opportunity to put my case because there are few players who can do what dominic does on a cricket field
4388367 i dont know how these decisions are made but ive got to walk out with these players and if theyre not in the best frame of mind ive got to deal with it
4388368 people sitting up there drinking their gin and tonic dont have to deal with it

4388370 he was great for me personally and especially the team hes a born leader so he could only help
4388371 i know he was an influential player for us and a great ambassador for the game im happy that hes in the premier league
4388372 im not surprised hes gone into management and found his way to the premier league
4388373 im surprised he didnt start his career there but im pleased hes here now and i wish him all the best apart from saturday
4388374 there will probably be a bit more aggression with incey in charge but theyve always been a good team solid at the back who pass and play the right way its going to be a tough game for us
4388375 roques a great player and we know what to expect from him from last season
4388376 we are overrun we register some 40 new cases each day
4388377 im not willing to say until im on the ground
4388378 i have been greatly encouraged by both of them and now believe that it is time to return home and make any contribution i can to the future of my country
4388379 his absence from the country was an indictment of the government of the day i would just hope he is coming back permanently he is an enormous resource
4388380 i have no political affiliations my obligations are solely to the people of kenya particularly the poor
4388381 i want to see that i am praying that that has happened
4388382 it is extremely important to maintain our existing store base in a tough environment with significant competition for customers whose disposable income is shrinking

4388386 a helicopter is helping direct the operation from above the blazing building
4388387 our main aim is to stop the fire spreading to the cornmill shopping centre
4388388 the alarm went off at 12 30am at first we thought it one of the biggest fires in darlingtons history was a false alarm as we had two last night then we realised it was for real
4388389 when we came out of the pub all we could see was smoke coming out of the roof and within a matter of minutes flames were coming out there was loads of people coming out of the hotel but it didnt look like anyone was seriously injured the fire brigade were already here when we came out but more and more engines kept coming
4388390 we couldnt believe what we were seeing the flames could be seen from miles away it looked like the whole town centre was on fire the smoke and flames seemed to fill the sky
4388391 there were loads of firefighters running around when i got here it seemed like it was going to take a lot of them to bring it under control at one point it looked like they had put it out but the flames just started shooting out of the roof again
4388392 i couldnt believe what i was seeing there were people everywhere just stood around watching what was going on a lot of the people who had come out of the hotel looked quite frightened many of them seemed to be from china or japan they didnt really know what was going on the police managed to move them to safety quite quickly
4388393 i was still awake when the alarm went off and my sister and i called my mum just to make sure she had heard the alarm
4388394 when i went upstairs to the fourth floor to get my mum i smelt smoke so i knew there was a fire
4388395 there were people who work in the hotel running in the halls telling people there was an actual fire and to get out people were heading out downstairs and then the police and fire trucks came
4388396 i came out and had a look and saw the fire ive never seen anything like it
4388397 fondamentalement le national socialisme et le marxisme sont la m me chose
4388398 in a time of higher prices and rising interest rates it is the financially secure within the valuable 40 plus market who are able to save and spend and therefore present businesses with a golden opportunity
4388399 very few marketers look at this age group we felt we were looking at a blinding flash of the obvious but at the same time its a complex group of people in other parts of the world theyve been addressing this group for a considerable time for instance facts such as the average consumer will buy 13 motor cars seven after the age of 50 are highly relevant here in the us over 50s are responsible for over 50 of buying power and dont forget they also invented rock and roll
4388400 lieblingstracker wo ich immer das bekomme was ich haben will einer besonders aber der hat leider einige fehler in der f hrung und ist dabei sich selber zu schrotten tog daf r aber der user freundlichste tracker den ich bisher sah
4388401 weve had a very small rally but its not much to write home about
4388402 theres three cuts in a row fully priced plus a couple further out
4388403 its a pretty clear cut path for the official cash rate here
4388404 the main push has been a firmer us dollar across the board as well as weaker commodities
4388405 the us is not out of the woods but seems to be improving compared to the rest of the world
4388406 thats why the sentiment towards the us dollar has changed
4388407 i dont think people are too keen to take positions into the weekend
4388408 wall street provided a good lead but weve seen spot gold come off oil was a bit weaker overnight and there was a fairly sharp rally in commodity stocks yesterday
4388409 equity traders remain sceptical as overbought commodity prices tumbled through the week on slowing global growth and stronger us dollar
4388410 i am the one whod rather be dead than confess
4388411 but he indicated what hardliners cannot accept that little poland too bore responsibility for the war
4388412 russias military crushing of georgia confronts the us with a stark choice whether to challenge moscow in its own backyard
4388413 the information so far is very encouraging the recent days have had very good air conditions indeed
4388414 there is no indication that there will be a problem in the near future
4388415 it was a surprise for me where was all the pollution i have read about in the newspapers
4388416 the olympics has been a real catalyst for environmental improvement in beijing people may be skeptical about it but it is happening
4388417 yes youve got good hair a nice nose even your lips theyre not too big or anything you look very nice for a black person
4388418 i think we should lock the door and tell people the registers are down again
4388419 the demand side is a major concern supplies from opec countries are rising but there is a shortage of buyers the industrial use in china has been cut back
4388420 these figures show that our countrys economy is still maintaining fast but balanced growth
4388421 my punishment is nothing compared to the pain and suffering ive brought you
4388422 im not strong enough to ask for forgiveness i ask the lord to forgive ive done horrible things that brought sorrow and pain to these wonderful people
4388423 rodriguez was one of the more violent ones during the escape
4388424 he would put these shanks in peoples ears while they were being tied up making threats
4388425 so he was right in front of him and firing directly at him
4388426 the memory of officer aubrey hawkins his dedication to duty and family are cherished by the irving police department and others that knew aubrey
4388427 our police family suffered a devastating loss through aubreys ultimate sacrifice
4388428 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
4388429 its not like theres one person involved there are six
4388430 this is an important agreement for the security of the united states for the security of poland and the security of our nato allies
4388431 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it
4388432 in reality this project has no relation to the iranian missile threat but is aimed against russia
4388433 these installations only worsen the situation we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
4388434 we do take very seriously the concerns of our ally
4388435 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4388436 in five seven or 10 years we want to be sufficiently well equipped and well trained to be ready both with our allies but by ourselves to defend ourselves at a critical moment
4388437 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party
4388438 a new element to take our security agreement to a new level
4388439 i have no indication that russias invasion of georgia at all influenced the negotiations but who knows you can draw your own conclusions
4388440 however the european missile defense is not aimed at countering russias missile arsenal but rather at emerging threats such as iran
4388441 were facing a new international situation the situation doesnt change our arguments but in my view reinforces them
4388442 this army travels around with irregulars travels around with marauders travels around with rapists travels around with arsonists robbers and with looters
4388443 residual security arrangements that the russians would be able to maintain
4388444 critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4388445 all persons interviewed highly recommended him for a position of trust and responsibility
4388446 dreyfus urged republicans to open their doors to people who had too long been excluded from party affairs women minorities urban workers and students
4388447 it certainly would have been something he might have had an interest in
4388448 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4388449 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4388450 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4388451 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4388452 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4388453 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4388454 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw
4388455 for he will be like a tree planted by the water
4388456 months of political deadlock have finally come to an end
4388457 the alliance has made it certain prachanda will become prime minister as theyll easily get the votes needed for a simple majority
4388458 he is packing his bags and will leave friday afternoon
4388459 theres no question of joining a maoist led government if our candidate is defeated
4388460 well stay in the opposition and play a constructive role so the peace process remains on track
4388461 i think the sentence is a bit light he should face a harsher sentence because he has committed a crime against a child
4388462 the committee has poked its nose out of the pocket of the coal sector long enough to tell the australian community that we will be the ones to carry the can for the mega profitable coal giants
4388463 the government needs to explain why the polluter shouldnt pay for cleaning up its own act and carry the risk of burying carbon pollution
4388464 this is a very important industry for the future of australia for the public interest and for the national interest
4388465 we need to find ways to assist the industry to begin
4388466 we feel that in the longer term situation that governments will become responsible anyway
4388467 this is the wrong way to go to sauna this is not about relaxing this is competition
4388468 clubs have invested well over 400 million building outdoor areas so that smokers wouldnt take their habit onto our streets
4388469 to their credit smokers have been very understanding and have been willing to exit to an outdoor area when they wish to have a cigarette
4388470 having congregations of people smoking outside on the footpath often in built up residential areas would be a nightmare for those living nearby as well as those walking on the street
4388471 common sense says large comfortable outdoor areas are the only way to control smokers and restrict their butts from ending up in our street gutters and ultimately our waterways
4388472 the national benchmark for anti smoking legislation is queensland where the government has successfully implemented a 100 per cent smoking ban in all pubs and clubs including outdoor eating and drinking areas
4388473 it was a terrorist attack with a bomb in the towns main street
4388474 it is very sad because people were celebrating when the bomb exploded
4388475 we take the future of our automobile industry seriously we take the future of manufacturing industry seriously
4388476 the lack of tariff protection is a blow to the industry as it puts australia out on a limb ahead of the rest of the world
4388477 australia at 10 per cent makes it tougher for local manufacturers in competing and drawing innovation and new technology to australia
4388478 there was a less distorting impact on the australian economy of transitional grants than there was in fact in maintaining a high tariff level
4388479 in some peoples minds industry policy is only about tariffs
4388480 lets make no mistake restructure is a euphemism for buying out jobs so there will be substantial job losses
4388481 kim carr and kevin rudd have squibbed us in relation to the automotive sector because they were full of promise over the last two years and now have basically come into lockstep with us
4388482 one thing i was pleased about and thats the green car fund the bracks review has in fact adopted the coalition policy which is to bring that money forward to 2009
4388483 that was my criticism and the criticism of many others in relation to the 35 million gift that was given to toyota out of the green car fund
4388484 there was no competitive process no analysis of it it was simply a photo opportunity in tokyo
4388485 kevin rudd and kim carr went around at the last election campaigning against lower tariffs and free trade agreements
4388486 that seems to be the big thing of the bracks review we should continue to decrease tariffs and we should continue to pursue free trade agreements which is exactly what the coalitions policy was at the last election
4388487 at the end of the day one mans tariffs is another mans tax
4388488 theres no denying if he tries to play well run at him
4388489 it wouldnt surprise me if he played but back six weeks after breaking an arm its a big ask
4388490 long term that could be an issue and hes a pretty valuable commodity

4388493 prince is coming back early from an arm injury that could be vulnerable not only this year but for coming years

4388496 youd think theyd be ticking all the boxes like we are with jt
4388497 maybe they were preoccupied with other life issues or selfish or stupid or stubborn
4388498 if your normal happy go lucky 12 year old child cant walk unaided for a period of weeks screams in pain cant shower wet and soils herself in her clothes if no one helps her to the toilet cries in the night and cant walk the next day you shouldnt need any medical training to have worked out that she is a very very sick young girl
4388499 you should not have any second thoughts about your decision
4388500 you will never be better informed than you are at this moment
4388501 regarding indonesias 63rd anniversary of independence 385 prisoners in kerobokan prison will receive a sentence reduction or remission
4388502 from that number 42 people will immediately be released because their service period is over
4388503 among the prisoners to get remission there are seven foreign citizens including schapelle corby and renae lawrence

4388560 i never realized how much i missed getting out there and talking to people and covering a story and lets face it pbs is probably a better fit for someone like me anyway
4388561 it was an enormous tragedy and a defining moment in modern history
4388562 i didnt like doing it and i dont think people bought it from me
4388563 the truth is i liked anchoring shows but i also got tired of anchoring shows
4388564 perhaps they got tired of me anchoring before i did
4388565 four of my last five meals have been on airplanes so you can imagine the perfect joy that is my life
4388566 the united states took in fewer than 1 000 iraqi refugees sweden took in 40 000 and you know they didnt start the war so the question for an american viewing audience to consider is whether or not we have a special responsibility to deal with people who cannot and believe me are not going home
4388567 a lot of them are people who went to work for american contractors for the military now they cant go home because theyre dead if they go home its pretty simple
4388568 when you do television you have this kind of mythical belief that the people sitting at home are fully dressed sober and paying attention and taking notes

4388592 you could say a game here is worth two elsewhere but it is more than that
4388593 i want to challenge myself both in matches and in training every day and i want to improve my game
4388594 that is why i am here as long as the manager keeps me as part of the team that will do for me
4388595 at this club all you have to do is look across at ryan giggs and paul scholes and see the way they train
4388596 it is such an example they set despite the success they have had and the rewards they have received they still want more and more
4388597 the game on saturday morning comes very quickly but in fairness i am not in a position where i can make many changes at the moment
4388598 a reasonable target for fabregas is the second leg of the champions league game but diaby will take four to six weeks
4388599 they have got the control and they have got the quality and if they play for arsenal then that means they are very good
4388600 i am happy for them because when i was the same age as them i dont think i was at a big club like

4388621 dass pop ein gegenentwurf zum ganzen sein k nnte daran kann man schon seit ungef hr 20 jahren nicht mehr glauben aber die umgekehrte diagnose dass es sich bei pop um ein ganz besonders perfides mittel der unterwerfung handeln m sse ist genauso falsch viele elemente der kulturellen ordnung pop haben sich weitgehend durchgesetzt zum beispiel die grundsatzfrage die immer an werke der pop musik gestellt wird was ist das eigentlich f r ein typ der das gerade spielt wie sieht der aus was will der diese frage wird inzwischen an alle kulturereignisse gestellt
4388622 russland hasst das demokratische und bl hende georgien weil es einen gef hrlichen pr zedenzfall f r den ganzen postsowjetischen raum geschaffen hat russland braucht ein schwaches uneiniges und zerst ckeltes georgien die russischen machthaber hassen unseren pr sidenten saakaschwili denn sie halten ihn zu recht f r den urheber und antreiber aller positiven ver nderungen die im land in den letzten jahren stattgefunden haben f r seine westliche orientierung f r sein bestreben der nato beizutreten f r die integration in die euro strukturen

4388630 the first funkyou site was a project started by okapi studio around 2004 and like many of those reading this right now we were watching and posting on that site everybody thought it was a cool project but then towards the end of 2005 it all stopped and sometime after that the domain registration for funkyou ro expired
4388631 this study reinforces that by utilizing dicer substrate technology we can knock down the expression of a targeted gene in a way that is highly selective specific and more potent than other rnai approaches furthermore our research suggests that aptamer dsirna delivery systems may offer an important new approach to treating hiv and potentially other infectious diseases in this particular study although the aptamer provided some inhibitory function when tested in this setting alone the dsirna chimeras provided more potent inhibition than the aptamer alone thus suggesting cooperative action between the dsirna and aptamer portions in inhibiting replication and spread of hiv
4388632 the goal of this study was to define modification patterns of 27 mer dsirnas that would be useful for research purposes and would remain active at most sites in different genes regardless of sequence context based on the chemical modifications we explored in this study it appears that the 2 ome modification may provide more generalized protection from immune responses than other 2 modifications
4388633 modification patterns of this kind may be useful in therapeutic applications of dicer substrate processed rnai molecules we expect that more extensively modified sequences could be developed for specific sites that would have increased nuclease stability and yet retain high potency which are desirable for pharmaceutical applications such as we are pursuing at dicerna
4388634 dicernas dicer substrate technology offers a new avenue to harness gene silencing and address the entire transcriptome for drug development these studies add to the growing body of data that will allow us to maximize the potential of this technology to develop novel potent and selective drug candidates for important unmet medical needs
4388635 our study shows that early weight loss can reduce the risk factors that so often lead to diabetes complications and death
4388636 weve known for a long time that weight loss is an important component in diabetes treatment and prevention now it appears there may be a critical window of opportunity following diagnosis in which some lasting gains can be achieved if people are willing to take immediate steps toward lifestyle changes
4388637 we dont know if the initial weight loss increased the bodys sensitivity to insulin or if the sustained lifestyle changes were the reason for the long term health benefits
4388638 but we do know that losing weight reduces the risk factors that often lead to heart disease blindness nerve and kidney damage amputations and death in type 2 diabetes patients
4388639 these analyses confirm the validity of our anti melanoma program using our models we have repeatedly demonstrated that vitiligo derived igg preparations can prevent tumor growth further we have observed a dose response to vitiligo derived igg based therapy

4388641 the global distribution of the highly pathogenic h5n1 avian influenza has caused the world health organization to show its profound concern regarding the possibility of the virus spreading from human to human in the future
4388642 furthermore the development of resistance to two approved anti influenza drugs oseltamivir tamiflu r and zanamivir relenza r as well as the lack of adequate vaccines has increased the need of developing new antiviral drugs
4388643 consequently i am delighted to be involved in the preclinical research stage of this innovative antiviral candidate and look forward to continuing our successful collaboration with canopus biopharma in this area
4388644 it is possible that higher doses of statin than those used in this study may result in even greater efficacy statc tm also appeared to be more effective when administered preventatively
4388645 we are also motivated at the potential of this compound in comparison with other currently available anti influenza medications its clear that there is significant global need for a superior low cost and plentiful alternative in the fight against influenza
4388646 the excellent result from this trial reaffirms that the 400 mg bronchitol dose being used in the phase 3 trials is optimal for its clinical effectiveness we look forward to the results from the ongoing phase 3 studies and to bringing bronchitol to the market as rapidly as possible

4388678 it just seems to be totally wrong to us to have a decision be made on who gets immunity and who does or does not get immunity based not on law but because of political decisions made by the diplomatic corps
4388679 we believe that the court was wrong in its interpretation of the law
4388680 under the courts rationale were a new yorker to be sideswiped by a car driven by an employee of the saudi embassy they could sue for bumps and bruises yet nearly 3 000 families of those innocents who were brutally killed in lower manhattan cannot pursue their claims

4388765 the roy morgan consumer confidence rating for new zealand has steadily improved since the record low of 82 points in early july when the interest rates were dropped
4388766 the jump in the roy morgan consumer confidence rating can be attributed to new zealanders feeling positive about their own situations in the next 12 months 50 expecting to be better off despite being unhappy about their current situations 51 feel worse off than last year
4388767 what would be a concern to the rbnz is 55 of new zealanders expect bad times over next 12 months and fewer new zealanders 39 down 3 say now is a good time to buy major household items

4388788 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4388789 the truth is i want to put on an amazing show for you the next time i come to your town
4388790 i promise i will be back better than ever and ready to rock out

4388813 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4388945 some seven men survived the general carnage and under the protection of general castrill n they were brought before santa anna among them was one of great stature well proportioned with regular features in whose face there was the imprint of adversity but in whom one also noticed a degree of resignation and nobility that did him honor he was the naturalist david crockett well known in north america for his unusual adventures who had undertaken to explore the country and who finding himself in b jar at the very moment of surprise had taken refuge in the alamo fearing that his status as a foreigner might not be respected santa anna answered castrill ns intervention in crocketts behalf with a gesture of indignation and addressing himself to the sappers the troops closest to him ordered his execution the commanders and officers were outraged at this action and did not support the order hoping that once the fury of the moment had blown over these men would be spared but several officers who were around the president and who perhaps had not been present during the danger became noteworthy by an infamous deed surpassing the solders in cruelty they thrust themselves forward in order to flatter their commander and with swords in hand fell upon these unfortunate defenseless men just as a tiger leaps upon his prey though tortured before they were killed these unfortunates died without complaining and without humiliating themselves before their torturers

4389055 the liberal democrat ams site is fast achieving cult status as surfers check out the latest musings on his personal web log

4389063 every man under my command owes me one hundred nazi scalps and yall will git me one hundred nazi scalps taken from the heads of one hundred dead nazis or die trying

4389072 my education here was an extraordinary effective preparation for all the things that ive done in the air force
4389073 as a nebraskan i enjoyed the benefit of the extraordinarily high quality of education that is offered here
4389074 the education i received here was of such quality and so well rounded with the rural rotations that it really prepared me for further training and experience in the air force its served me very well
4389075 unmc is a preeminent medical center it was then and is now it makes omaha and nebraska an exceptionally well served community
4389076 it is one of the premier residency programs for us in the air force
4389077 the relationship has been very positive both in the quality of training and the breath and the scope of training to provide really high quality well trained family physicians able to do the mission where ever we find ourselves around the world and we find ourselves in some pretty challenging places
4389078 ability to bring injured warfighters home safely in our air force air evacuation system utilizing our critical care air medical transport teams to transport these wounded individuals across thousands of miles not only simply sustaining them but also actually improving their medical condition
4389079 our medical centers provide the majority of health care for our airmen their families beneficiaries retires and their families
4389080 quite honestly though we cannot do it all some locations do not have the full spectrum of care available to do that so we rely on our civilian counterparts to provide that care the physicians in bellevue and the omaha area have been very forward leaning and very helpful in providing that care we are not able to provide within our facility at offutt air force base
4389081 it is our duty and obligation to track that very closely and to intervene as early as possible in order to assure return to health
4389082 gordy was a bigger than life individual his personality his warmth he would just brighten up the place he was very open about his health issues he used to come into the market basket restaurant and pick up rolls for his office he would tell guys to make sure they got their psa exams he has a great family and they all bring a lot to the community he will truly be missed
4389083 gordy participated in several clinical trials he was always open to explore new options he was always optimistic even when he got bad news it was just the way he approached his disease he would just say ok what do we next he understood the limitations we had he was always in a good mood always joking he was even cracking jokes on his death bed he was just a great guy
4389084 he touched everyones life from the secretary to the techs even when he transferred his care to methodist hospital when dr hauke moved there i had tons of people asking me about gordy he was such a wonderful man even when he was seriously ill he always kept his sense of humor he brought in a poster board of all his familys previous christmas cards they were a hoot the whole family was involved each year they would do something different with props and costumes but every card was hilarious he always tried to keep things fun i have no doubt theyve been preparing for him for days up in heaven
4389085 gordy was quite a character i remember we admitted him last year to help control his pain he was very uncomfortable he was lying on his side when i came into his room he recognized my voice and rolled over and greeted me with this big smile and said how are you doing he always maintained his sense of humor and looked on the positive side he was a special guy a great friend and patient
4389086 my dad had a talent he could speak to people at every level it was an unbelievable gift he was a real high energy guy i used to have friends come over and they would say is your dad that way all the time he was he loved to meet new people and make new friends
4389087 i got to practice with gordy for more than 20 years it didnt matter what your station in life was he treated everyone well he was a true advocate for all his clients he would always stop and take time to listen he was a perfect example of the qualities that make someone a good lawyer he set a tone in our office that made it a rare place to practice law he was a terrific friend and ill always remember him for being such a kind hearted person

4389093 there are no guarantees when you enter a clinical trial were simply trying to explore new options and look for potentially better treatments typically advances occur incrementally and dont happen overnight in my opinion these people are heroes they are truly making a difference for future generations
4389094 we thought the med center was top notch a we couldnt say enough good things about the experience we loved the physicians and nurses and the care they provided we had a great time with those people
4389095 im not sure who does the hiring there but theyre doing a great job every nurse had this outstanding personality there is a fine line between compassion and personality and they all have it dad would walk down the hall and hed always have the nurses saying gordy gordy gordy my mom used to bring them cookies

4389264 i hit the ground funny and i remember trying to get up and i couldnt move my left arm
4389265 hes a very versatile player he is an unusual tight end not many of them can threaten you in the run and pass game thats kind of like finding a 7 foot center in basketball a good one there arent many of them around
4389266 hes got that ability and that makes him i think a very unique player and hes a tremendous team guy
4389267 sitting out was real hard for him to be kind of on that border line to where maybe he could play
4389268 one of the good things about him being injured is he was kind of another coach there because hes so experienced having him be injured it was another guy watching another guy to go ask for some tips or advice he really helps you out
4389269 the biggest disadvantage is me not being able to coach him a little bit
4389270 he was in meetings but he wasnt really able to be on the field training camp for him is now
4389271 just being with coach doyle helped a lot building up confidence in my arm
4389272 with all due respect to any of our first year guys these are guys weve seen play for us and we think they have a great opportunity to impact our offensive football team

4389286 michael is back in training but i think to be honest manchester united will come a bit early
4389287 its no good trying to kid people he just needs a week in with the group doing all the things he needs to do and were not going to get that into him now so i think its very very doubtful
4389288 im a drogheda fan through and through but on friday night i wont be a drogheda fan
4389289 all of my friends are drogheda fans and my family are drogheda fans but bohs pay my wages these sort of things tend to happen in football
4389290 i over reacted a little bit when i scored twice in united park earlier in the season and ive learnt from that there wont be any similar celebrations on friday unless i score a hat trick
4389291 at the start of the season it was tight enough between us and we have them twice more in the league still
4389292 it is going to be tough but we are on our home patch drogheda are in great form at the moment although the cup is a different kettle of fish
4389293 they are scrapping all over the place to do me on something
4389294 there is a witch hunt there are that many rules people cant keep up
4389295 why did they the fa let the transfer go through why all of a sudden does it come out two weeks before the end of the transfer window
4389296 im not saying i never did it i did do it but what im saying is i did it two years ago

4389300 he is day to day in terms of coming back
4389301 he is getting a little better each day and hopefully it wont be too much longer
4389302 this one is different its a muscle not a broken bone
4389303 hes very frustrated of course he wants to be out there right now he wanted to be out there last week he is a very conscientious and driven player the patriots have been great about it you have to be careful with that injury
4389304 we had a good opportunity to work with him there at a couple of different spots
4389305 of course it would be good to have him and every other player back on the field i am sure he is working hard to get back and when he is ready he will be back out there hopefully that will be soon
4389306 it is unfortunate with the time that he is missing we have worked with him some but with him out that provides opportunities for other players we will evaluate them we just have to do the best that we can with the information that we have it is not perfect but that is all there is
4389307 one of the things i like most about this rookie class is that theyre very attention to detail
4389308 im not saying that they come out and we practice and we do it exactly like we want to do it but you can tell in the classroom if somebody is kind of half paying attention or theyre really into it and these guys to their credit 23 practices in it starts getting a little old listening to me theyre very attentive theyre very good in the classroom
4389309 i feel good out here im happy to be back
4389310 you just dont want people falling into the quarterback when they are throwing which is a pretty unprotected position for them
4389311 i think the red jersey is easier for everybody to identify but now i think we have enough experience to know where everybody is what the tempo is when to pull off and those types of things not just for the quarterbacks but in a lot of areas like playing the ball or potential collisions we try to save those for the game and not blow each other up in practice
4389312 its good trying to get back into the flow of things getting into a rhythm with my teammates communicating out there getting on the same page and just executing patriots defense like were supposed to do
4389313 theyre our equivalent to frank sinatra or elvis theyre that well known everybody knows every song they sing they know the songs word by word

4389323 were releasing weibe pendergasts work online in a weeks time
4389324 it will be a top seller im sure and even though it is meant for those familiar with the las vegas nevada politics literary world many others may find it of general interest as well
4389325 i think teaching this story will be highly educational for my las vegas nevada politics students irregardless of what critics believe
4389326 heck if we always listened to critics nothing would be sold they serve a purpose but i leave the fact checking to qualified historians and researchers
4389327 pre sale polls show this new las vegas nevada politics book doubling gross sales figures of other recent releases
4389328 and i believe clelia samos book may be a complete blockbuster if trends stick well see marked sales numbers within two weeks that will demonstrate year highs
4389329 in the literary world we seek to heighten public awareness about the las vegas nevada politics industry and how it works this is absolutely essential for those in the academic literary and research fields
4389330 because the work that has been done in the las vegas nevada politics literary area has been huge
4389331 i think napps lumbras new docu novel leads readers astray there is too much focus on making the fictional characters function whereas more attention should have been paid to the facts
4389332 i like the fact that it reaches out to those outside of the literary world this is a wise decision and proves a good way to educate others about new things
4389333 but were doing it to make sure no unauthorized copies get resold we want to avoid plagiarism and pirating as much as possible furthermore this will be our new procedure for future releases by author gerard piedigrossi who has pledged support for this system
4389334 im happy we were able to release my las vegas nevada politics book on time
4389335 timing is crucial in this market and luckily we chose the right publishers for the job
4389336 this book speaks volumes about the impact of las vegas nevada politics in society and we knew from a business responsibility stand point that releasing it on time would really make a difference
4389337 but whatever you do get one of these las vegas nevada politics products while supplies last
4389338 my old government teacher will probably flip when he hears im going to the white house
4389339 its the oval office the lincoln bedroom the cabinet room the presidents personal sleeping quarters think of all the decisions that have been made in these places over the years
4389340 but on the tour day were going to take a group photo on the roof its going to be pretty incredible

4389342 when you stand on the roof of the white house you think my god how does this happen to a guy who works on chimneys but thats whats great about this country anything is possible its just a matter of finding a way to do it and following up on it
4389343 he could probably tell from my application that i was on my knees begging it was pretty pathetic
4389344 i think the guy asked me how many jobs i had done and i was like yours and one more will be two
4389345 but its not just this president think of all the presidents who have lived in the white house this is a defining point in my career i can almost die now knowing i cant do a higher honor

4389379 im thrilled to be one of the only stores to carry this middle east e gaming development book release
4389380 in the case of our middle east e gaming development marketing venture we initially started out with a simple website and then slowly grew as sales increased
4389381 then the website expanded into a data warehouse essentially a store of all things related to our marketing campaigns which allowed us to study and refine subsequent efforts
4389382 if you walk up to someone and say ive got a great middle east e gaming development business idea would you contribute 100k theyll probably laugh and consider you a lunatic but if you approach someone and say look i have this great idea and my plan is the following it will reassure an anxious investor that things will move forward with thought and purpose
4389383 ive seen companies with nearly everything perfect budget great it good distribution but a terrible working dynamic between the employees though the middle east e gaming development product makes it to store shelves the people working within the company feel miserable unappreciated and unmotivated
4389384 i find that attending industry related social functions conferences and even my neighbors cocktail parties help me find new ways of growing my company
4389385 by asking the right people the right questions youll find that you can learn new things and different strategies for your middle east e gaming development firm that you may not have thought of before
4389386 many middle east e gaming development companies go pel mel spending money when there is a good cash flow while there is nothing wrong with wanting to expand it has to be done in accordance with accounting standards and detailed record keeping this is especially true for public companies private middle east e gaming development firms can sometimes let this aspect of the business slide alittle
4389387 starting up any middle east e gaming development business is difficult in our case it took about 6 months of planning a year of fund raising and then another 6 months of building infrastructure before we made our first sale

4389399 perhaps we were a bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse in the first half we had too many unforced errors we needed to be more dynamic show more personality and to try to drive the play we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do

4389401 a range of new research has shown that the credit crunch is having an impact from the boardrooms controlled by billionaire owners down to the loyal fans who provide the foundation for every club
4389402 chelsea are determined to complete the world record signing of kak but they will have to wait until next year to do so
4389403 after six years of holding back the big clubs look ready to pull the trigger on the kinds of mega deals that thus far have existed only in football
4389404 spurs are blessed with a plethora of attacking talent and if they can keep their defenders injury free they could be unlikely title contenders
4389405 west brom are certainly the most reliable of the three newcomers they look good too but that doesnt mean they wont end their big night out going back whence they came with only stoke and hull for company
4389406 becoming a professional footballer is every boys dream including 26 year old writer and sunday league amateur ben welch so how does he cope playing for league one side swindon town on their pre season tour of austria as they take on former european champions
4389407 a range of new research has shown that the credit crunch is having an impact from the boardrooms controlled by billionaire owners down to the loyal fans who provide the foundation for every club across the country we are getting the same message the credit crunch is hitting football and the effect is likely to be even greater next year said professor tom cannon of the university of buckinghams business school the most obvious immediate impact has been on the amount spent in the premier league transfer market which is poised to show its first yearly drop for more than five years indeed with just over two weeks until the summer window closes the clubs have so far spent 300 million on transfers compared with a record breaking 530 million for the full period last year
4389408 adrian mutu can finally count the true cost of his positive drug test at chelsea after fifa yesterday ordered him to pay 13 8m in damages to his former club it is the biggest fine ever handed down to a football player the world games governing body calculated the compensation according to the value of the remaining period on a contract that was cancelled by chelsea in october 2004 after he tested positive for cocaine mutu now 29 is almost certain to appeal he served a seven month ban and paid a 20 000 fine at the time
4389409 chelsea are determined to complete the world record signing of kak but they will have to wait until next year to do so chelsea have not given up hope of completing the world record signing of kak from ac milan but have resigned themselves to having to wait until next year to secure his signature the club view the pursuit of the brazilian as a long term project similar to the one that led to them luring andriy shevchenko from the san siro two years ago and after being rejected this summer will make a renewed attempt to secure their dream signing in 12 months time the times has learnt that chelsea are working with several leading agents on a deal that could take more than a year to come to fruition milan have rejected several polite inquiries this summer and insisted that kak is not for sale at any price but they indicated that they may be willing to do business in the future
4389410 chelsea have laid the groundwork to move decisively for kak next summer but perhaps times have changed perhaps the marginal impact of a superstar today is perceived to be far greater than it has been in recent years not least because the globalised pie has grown and at the highest levels image rights are far more valuable than at any time in the past after six years of holding back the big clubs look ready to pull the trigger on the kinds of mega deals that thus far have existed only in football
4389411 chelsea will lodge a new 23million bid for robinho who has told real madrid i must go the brazilian superstar is even ready to strike in a bid to engineer a move to stamford bridge sunsport can reveal the striker has told real supremo ramon calderon he wants to join the blues and if he does not get his way he will refuse to play in reals game with valencia this weekend his agent wagner ribeiro met madrid officials yesterday but calderon rejected the plea telling him he was a major part of their plans and that chelsea must pay 30m if they want him
4389412 chelsea are ready to raid manchester city with an 8million move for teenage striker daniel sturridge and make him the new didier drogba roman abramovichs club have the cash to snatch the 18 yearold prospect who has been on their wish list for a couple of seasons and a three man delegation watched him playing last night the stamford bridge outfit know city have to wheel and deal to bring in new players for mark hughes and this could be the perfect time to try and snatch sturridge birmingham born sturridge isnt 19 until next month but is already shaping up as a star of the future
4389413 berbatov trained in london yesterday and the prospects of him being at old trafford in time for sundays curtain raiser against newcastle united do appear to be receding since the paperwork would have to be completed by 5pm today though ramos resolutely refused to discuss him or his future he acknowledged that it was a time of uncertainty spurs have said berbatov will not go before a replacement is found and that quest is far from complete united are working on a deal for berbatov and spurs belief that barcelona are also monitoring the 27 year old could move negotiations along on the eve of the premier league season
4389414 sunsport can reveal the spanish giants have told spurs they are ready to make a move for the wantaway striker united remain favourites to land the bulgarian but only if they meet spurs 30million asking price so far united have not budged from 25m and if they do not up their bid spurs will listen to barca and they would be far more willing to reach a compromise deal with them than negotiate with united
4389415 wayne rooney has won his fight to play in manchester uniteds league opener on sunday but crocked michael owen is out of newcastles line up at old trafford rooney 22 was hit by a virus during uniteds pre season trip to nigeria the england forward began training again on monday though and is fit for the big kick off after putting himself through tough double training sessions every day this week
4389416 manchester city will return to blackburn rovers with an improved offer of around 15m for roque santa cruz even that is not guaranteed to persuade blackburn to sell the paraguay striker although the fact city are able to offer such a large sum will encourage the clubs supporters that thaksin shinawatra still has the money to compete at the higher end of the transfer market
4389417 manchester city are to test blackburn rovers resolve to hold on to roque santa cruz by increasing their offer for the 26 year old striker to around 15m but at the same time are understood to have launched a 10m bid for real zaragozas diego milito the moves represent a real statement of intent from city who are desperate to land a striker given their injury crisis with benjani mwaruwari and darius vassell out while jo is on olympic duty within the next few days that is unlikely to happen before their first premier league game on sunday away to aston villa
4389418 blackburn are bracing themselves for a bidding war between manchester city and tottenham with the london club set to move in for striker roque santa cruz rovers turned down a 12million bid from city for the 26 year old paraguayan marksman yesterday and the frustrated player is now ready to ask for a transfer spurs are waiting to pounce with white hart lane boss juande ramos a huge admirer
4389419 but will that challenge come this year or do manchester united and chelsea remain a class apart i think they will finish third said lee dixon it pains me to say it because i want us to challenge and win it but i just feel were a little bit short arsenals wait for silverware any silverware might go on a little while longer
4389420 a lot of people talk about us and say we play good football good football is good but we didnt win anything last season and you play to win what we are going to keep in our heads is that playing good football is good but sometimes you have to be tough on the pitch to win a game we have learned a lot of things sometimes you have to be dirty to win some games against twente we didnt play good football we certainly didnt play our best but we won 2 0 and thats what its all about sometimes you have to forget about playing beautiful football and just make sure you win
4389421 you cant say theyre not trying fernando torres and robbie keane even took up seats together on liverpools flight home from liege on wednesday night attempting perhaps to develop some of the telepathy which will be fundamental to their sides hopes of progress this season the combination of pigeon liverpudlian and broad dublin would have made for a curious conversation but the two certainly had some talking to do a goalless draw was considerably less than liverpool deserved from the belgian steelmaking city and though rafael benitez spared the strikers from his uncharacteristically blunt assessment if the team dont play well the strikers dont get the chances he said a night on the banks of the river maas provided a telling reminder that a combined 40m of investment does not buy an instinctive understanding
4389422 liverpool fans are indulging in a familiar august pastime namely pondering all the permutations to work out whether they will finally win the title for the first time since 1990 earlier in the summer i made a written promise to liverpool fans who accused me of forever running down their chances of winning the premier league i said i would return to the subject on the eve of the new campaign study the summers events and assess whether this season would be any different from the last 18 years in title terms
4389423 sometimes in life you have to take one step back to take two steps forward take boaz myhill for example a promising young goalkeeper with premier league side aston villa one minute sold to hull city and thrown into first team action in the football leagues basement division the next a drop down three divisions can rarely have paid such remarkable dividends in the space of five years
4389424 the media had certainly written bolton off and it still sticks in his craw that no apologies were forthcoming when against all the odds the club stayed up there were a lot of articles saying we were relegated including one from a well respected journalist saying bolton have gone and im pleased they have ive yet to see a retraction of that we football managers get judged every seven days but who judges him for getting that wrong
4389425 spurs are blessed with a plethora of attacking talent and if they can keep their defenders injury free they could be unlikely title contenders
4389426 west brom are certainly the most reliable of the three newcomers they look good too but that doesnt mean they wont end their big night out going back whence they came with only stoke and hull for company
4389427 in their more rational moments most people would accept refereeing is an impossible job but i had no idea just how hard it is before being taken on a pre season training day with the football association forget about dives and dissent high tackles and shirt pulling have you ever tried blowing a whistle while running then after an otherwise blameless match you can ruin it all by seeing a clipped ankle a player tumbling yards inside the box and awarding a penalty when replays will show that the contact was made an inch on the other side of the line no wonder alan wilkie once a premier league official and now a referees assessor speaks of an obscene level of punditry
4389428 the long months of waiting are over now its time for some real honest to goodness mud slinging in your face dust ups europes 2008 2009 soccer season got under way this week with frances ligue 1 kicking off over the weekend today the bundesliga season starts in germany and on saturday the english premier league begins play in a couple of weeks spains la liga and italys serie a will be up and running and the planets most popular single sport club competition the european champions league will begin attracting the kind of global viewing numbers that the nfl and nba can only dream about
4389429 becoming a professional footballer is every boys dream including 26 year old writer and sunday league amateur ben welch so how does he cope playing for league one side swindon town on their pre season tour of austria as they take on former european champions here he relives the pleasure and pain of life on the pitch
4389430 argentina has the potential to retain its olympic gold medal but to do this it must be prepared to adjust itself to the circumstances that lie ahead as the competition reaches its decisive elimination stage the argentines are still the team to beat but must focus on its objective at all moments
4389431 come for ronaldinho stay for gervinho that is the message that emerges as the mens olympic soccer tournament heads into the knockout stages individually players like ronaldinho and lionel messi have done their bit to raise the glamour level of the competition but it has also been lesser known players like italys sebastian giovinco and the aforementioned gervinho from the ivory coast who have added some sparkle
4389432 yeah that ones good but you gotta read the drawing of the dark
4389433 i think the way i play and the skills i have are better suited in cleveland
4389434 me playing with a facilitator it really grows my game in milwaukee they were looking for something different they were looking for a distributor and that really didnt play to my strengths because it took away from my aggressiveness i think that this is just a better situation for my game
4389435 my reaction is that i really feel good about it because and i think mike brown can attest to this if he wasnt id still be in milwaukee
4389436 some of us didnt feel comfortable doing it just because to me it was a little clownish but the sponsors insisted and insisted
4389437 i cant even understand my kids let alone another language
4389438 there are a lot of numbers statistics that we could talk about in his career
4389439 but there are several components that are more important than stats as to why were so excited in bringing kasey back one of them is character
4389440 i hope to be a part of this team not just for two years ill be playing but for 10 20 years after that
4389441 id love to work my way up and be a part of the sounders for life
4389442 ive been a fan of kaseys for his entire career
4389443 im proud to be involved in the process to bring his family back to seattle
4389444 im absolutely sure kasey will be an excellent ambassador for this franchise
4389445 kasey has experience around the world in the locker room that experience is paramount kasey is a natural leader
4389446 i said from day one when i left for europe that one day i wanted to come home and play
4389447 i always said i wanted to play in america ive been close several times
4389448 i always said i might as well stay in europe
4389449 but its not just to bring my family home and settle in the northwest
4389450 im coming home to play im coming to help this team establish itself as one of the top teams in the country
4389451 a county must review its entire comprehensive plan every seven years
4389452 however the gma does not explicitly require a county to revise every aspect of its comprehensive plan and we refuse to imply such an onerous requirement
4389453 some certainty that their land uses wont be influenced by a state body that isnt aligned with the local circumstances and values
4389454 those are important because theyre going to protect the puget sound water quality and the rural character
4389455 the high court agreed with us on whether the urban growth area was constrained by state office of financial management population projections and that the county couldnt count forest and agricultural lands as part of its rural element
4389456 appears to clear the way for getting back to the bottom up system that was originally promised under the growth management act

4389458 hes a star most kids wont be able to meet
4389459 i started playing rec soccer when i was 6 or 7 years old
4389460 its really awesome playing on a field where a bunch of other stars played
4389461 in this area we must balance all reasonable conclusions with evidence that is backed up by proper statistical studies personally when i want to structure an argument regarding middle eastern gaming policy i look to the studies and conclusions of jetta maciak who was a pioneer in the field and highly regarded statistician
4389462 he did it and he played on so we expect him to be okay but that was the reason that he didnt train on wednesday
4389463 against the kangaroos in round 18 we had 12 guys who had shots at goal but we openly had three goal kickers
4389464 those small medium forwards when you get two or three shots at goal it makes an enormous difference if you kick three or none out of your three shots
4389465 purely the conversion accuracy is holding us back in terms of those small medium forwards
4389466 weve won there the last three times the players seemed to like playing at the gabba
4389467 every time weve trained there the night before the game theyve had a real spring in their step
4389468 i dont know whether its the warm weather but the players seemed to respond well to playing in brisbane
4389469 i dont think its so much the opponents i think it may be the venue
4389470 but its all about tomorrow night and how we play and how they play
4389471 i feel like i found my perfect fit shes taught me lessons about myself and i feel like ive taught her

4389488 defects in brain dopamine synthesis and release were evident in rats immediately after birth
4389489 the notion that decreased dopamine signaling leads to increased feeding is compatible with the finding from human studies that obese individuals have reduced central dopamine receptors

4389508 look everyone knows that tobia lesane inc contributed to our partys campaigns last year this is not news remember however that we have a duty to our constituents our voters to protect them from corporate malpractice and shoddy workmanship

4389511 and want to show respect to the companies while at the same time challenging them to make something that is better for consumers not their bottom lines
4389512 this is the most consumer friendly online gaming product we have ever released our prices are lower quality is higher and warrantees are guaranteed for life
4389513 famous inventor and engineer rasheeda furne whose input was sought on the new online gaming product was on hand to answer technical questions from the crowd
4389514 we have spent so many resources trying to create reliable rng software using traditional algorithms and caculi theorems but have never really analyzed geometric proofs and associated logic as a means to perfect our efforts

4389518 in the past weve worked hard with many sportsbooks but now realize our strengths are found in the digital gaming sector with specific success with online casinos as the year continues to progress well be sure to keep ahead of all new advancements
4389519 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4389520 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4389521 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4389522 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4389523 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4389524 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4389525 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4389526 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4389527 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4389528 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4389529 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4389530 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4389531 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4389532 we will investigate any information that is passed to us and ensure it is accurate before responding in a proportionate and measured way
4389533 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned
4389534 however these types of enquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve
4389535 did you see five young men riding on three mopeds along the pavement
4389536 did you see anything of the incident when shots were fired into the costcutters store
4389537 maybe chief silva has to come and grab somebody in his neck and pin them to the wall
4389538 im very close to doing that so write that down
4389539 maybe half of the team wants to do the best they can i can talk about the starting rotation we want to do our best every time we cross that line you know
4389540 but maybe half of the team doesnt have that mentality they only think to finish strong and to put up the numbers thats great but that affects us as a team that doesnt work out
4389541 instead of moving a runner they want to get a base hit just because of the numbers instead of to get a ground ball maybe i want to strike him out because of my numbers you know what i mean thats what were doing right now
4389542 i dont care if we are 40 games behind we should play better than this
4389543 we are travelling to south africa with president robert mugabe today as the negotiations continue
4389544 the talks never collapsed and all parties are committed to the dialogue i would also want to confirm commitment to see the talks end successfully sooner rather than later
4389545 we cannot continue wandering around without direction hence the need to swear in parliamentarians and open the house so that the elected members can continue to fulfil their constitutional mandate
4389546 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4389547 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4389548 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4389549 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4389550 en 1963 las milicias de fidel castro tiraron un cerco alrededor de la finca donde viv amos y lo nico que pudimos encontrar de mi padre fue el mulo donde sali montado con sesenta y dos impactos de balas cerca de nuestra casa de ah no hemos sabido m s nunca de l
4389551 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4389552 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4389553 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4389554 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4389555 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4389556 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4389557 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4389558 who are open to doing something on the production side
4389559 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4389560 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4389561 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4389562 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4389563 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4389564 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4389565 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4389566 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4389567 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4389568 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4389569 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4389570 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4389571 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4389572 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4389573 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4389574 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4389575 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4389576 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4389577 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4389578 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4389579 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4389580 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4389581 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4389582 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4389583 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4389584 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4389585 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4389586 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4389587 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4389588 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4389589 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4389590 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4389591 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4389592 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4389593 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4389594 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4389595 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4389596 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4389597 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4389598 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4389599 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4389600 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4389601 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4389602 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4389603 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4389604 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4389605 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4389606 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4389607 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4389608 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4389609 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4389610 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4389611 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4389612 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4389613 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4389614 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4389615 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4389616 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4389617 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4389618 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4389619 no matter what the event is i want to win but it didnt happen
4389620 i didnt know i had as little time as i did i didnt even have time to go into the ready room
4389621 i went from the ceremony straight into putting my parka on and goggles cap and go it was about two minutes i knew it was tight but not that tight
4389622 it just kind of flowed it just happened it felt great i just kept it strong and powered to the end
4389623 the last 15 i had plenty left in me i saw liesel behind and just pushed for the wall
4389624 i didnt know what was going on i just went for it
4389625 full credit for her she kept working hard and driving through the wall
4389626 i was so thankful that i was in there in the first place and i got a lane
4389627 i just forgot about the pain and got ready for my next race
4389628 she xie performed better and better throughout the match i just couldnt keep up she lost the first game but she adapted a strategy to move the shuttle around the court more and sped up after that
4389629 he came forward with a positive test and his medals and diploma will be withdrawn
4389630 the ioc now asks the shooting sport federation to modify the results
4389631 this beta blocking agent is banned only in certain sports such as shooting and archery which require great control therefore i can only describe it the drug taking as deliberate
4389632 this was probably a result of poor information to a young athlete who was not sure what she could take
4389633 i didnt expect that many cases to occur during the games
4389634 i was a little sluggish but now it feels good and my body woke up in the heat
4389635 there is a very good chance that we will have six caribbean sprinters in the final
4389636 i was a little flat but it got over the line so that is all that matters
4389637 i feel very good i expended very little energy so i think i have a lot to give in the final

4389646 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4389647 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4389648 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4389649 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4389693 how did you get up here this is a private area
4389694 if not that katran welcomes me into his home rather often
4389695 mister katran obviously did not inform you that we are related
4389696 oh how could i misunderstand shortness of breath mr hargreaves i am equally adept at discerning innuendos as anyone who makes their life out on the street
4389697 if this is a situation where you do not want company
4389698 then might i suggest that you offer the excuse of retiring to your room
4389699 it seems that katran has not told you of delilah
4389700 i would think that you would recognize the sound having been acquainted with it
4389701 and i must express my surprise that you are familiar with the sound as well
4389702 and this is supposed to help your argument that it was a misunderstanding
4389703 im going to get someone to check it out and when i return let me know what has happened in the mean time
4389704 it cant be open ended either geographically or in time
4389705 it has to be circumscribed and its got to be in the context of the russians withdrawing all their armed forces
4389706 if tomorrow president saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start
4389707 this is the first baby step for christopher neil in terms of having him held accountable for the international sex crimes he is accused of committing

4389717 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4389718 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4389719 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4389720 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4389721 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4389722 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4389723 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw

4389732 all of my friends are drogheda fans and my family are drogheda fans but bohs pay my wages these sort of things tend to happen in football
4389733 i over reacted a little bit when i scored twice in united park earlier in the season and ive learnt from that there wont be any similar celebrations on friday unless i score a hat trick
4389734 at the start of the season it was tight enough between us and we have them twice more in the league still
4389735 it is going to be tough but we are on our home patch drogheda are in great form at the moment although the cup is a different kettle of fish

4389750 when each mud snail has the ability to produce large quantities of embryos without a partner youve really got a problem

4389753 i could sum it up in one word nothing the permit doesnt change a thing
4389754 to keep them occupied and give them an outlet for privacy theyve been given these virtual reality modules
4389755 they each have a little corner to call their own and it can be anything they want it to be a place they can be alone they can do some sort of activity or be in some time period its whatever they want

4389761 every time i come to visit my folks i take a ride to battle creek get with the ymca management and put on a clinic to help promote the game of racquetball
4389762 i really love learning new techniques and trying out new racquets i get the chance to do both at this clinic
4389763 when i arrived the fire was through the roof and people were hanging out of windows and yelling for help they did an outstanding job of rescuing everyone if it werent for their efforts it could have been a real tragedy
4389764 someone began pounding on the door with a stick and yelling to get out
4389765 i could smell the smoke and heard the fire alarm
4389766 he went back in and found her and brought her out in a wheelchair
4389767 i am shocked it is a strange feeling to be standing here in clothes borrowed from my daughter
4389768 i heard the alarm the fire alarm woke me up i put on clothes and we didnt see nothing but we were busy knocking on doors
4389769 by the time i got here and i live just around the corner the flames were through the roof

4389780 i was able to hit the zone with all my pitches but the sinker was most effective for me

4389782 i just didnt have the guys ready in the bullpen to do the job
4389783 i thought the frasor would be my best bet but he couldnt get the job done
4389784 i just kept looking up thinking this is your home track everything is going to work its almost like that story is coming i can feel it
4389785 i knew this was the one course that i could lose all my strokes on that i earned all week
4389786 after six or seven holes i really thought it was going to be the day that i did but after getting eight birdies in a row and a three to finish i just felt like this weight just lifted
4389787 ive been in a position where ive tried to hold people off and it doesnt work to good i dont even care what the scores are im just trying to shoot my best on every course and hopefully it works for me in the end im going to come out tomorrow and im going to try to attack
4389788 watching the pros play is the best experience you can get
4389789 all top level players are ridiculously good it makes me pumped to play my next round tomorrow being in the amateur division
4389790 i try to explain to other players its one thing to have a coach and learn something but i think the greats are people who learn from watching an imitating
4389791 because in disc golf its not about someone telling you what to do its about seeing what to do and trying to make your body do the same thing
4389792 i really wanted them to see it and im keeping in touch with them and keeping them updated
4389793 theyre hoping to be better in the fall and come out to augusta georgia to watch me play
4389794 columbia avenue is probably one of the most heavily traveled roads in the county but it needs some improvement its one of the entry ways into battle creek thats been neglected
4389795 i dont think anyone is denying we need to increase revitalization efforts in that corridor i think more than anything we need to look at this as a partnership
4389796 it could be delayed a year but just because this gets delayed doesnt mean its dead
4389797 sales are slow there was an increase in the minimum wage and the economy is real bad
4389798 i pay 9 000 a year now in taxes what is the city using that money for
4389799 im for improving the area i think were all for that but its the assessment im against
4389800 lets explore our options before they tax us to death
4389801 weve tried to be as transparent as possible to work together and show the value of having a collective body that can go to the city and address concerns
4389802 had i gotten the tax bill with the assessment without the information and background ahead of time i would have protested
4389803 i think this is a great opportunity ive never spent property taxes where ive had any direct input into how the money was spent

4389827 and its obvious that the present government and cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4389828 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty

4389883 i am very hungry too and our rent is due in a few days i wondered if you would do me a huge favor and just this once oblige my rich friend who is willing to pay enough
4389884 we didnt experience the same price appreciation as the coasts so were not seeing the results of the crash
4389885 the move up market in new mexico is getting hit
4389886 new home inventory has decreased in the past few years and the new home inventory in albuquerque is pretty much gone
4389887 we tend to have a conservative borrowing population in new mexico
4389888 in order for the market to pick up again this needs to be corrected
4389889 but were not going to see that with builders shaving off profits because thats already being done builders at this point are just trying to break even
4389890 it cant be open ended either geographically or in time
4389891 it has to be circumscribed and its got to be in the context of the russians withdrawing all their armed forces
4389892 if tomorrow president saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start
4389893 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4389894 this is a member state of the united nations and its internationally recognized borders need to be respected
4389895 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4389896 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4389897 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4389898 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
4389899 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4389900 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4389901 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4389902 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4389903 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4389904 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4389905 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4389906 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4389907 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4389908 no rule to pursue but such as he prescribes to himself
4389909 should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others
4389910 if it be wished that my relation to the bank be continued it may be well to send me the usual retainer
4389911 that the dependency of private funding simply shifts the focus of congress thats all and if so is this really the issue to worry about
4389912 whom i think it does compromise they feel like they have to ameliorate or change their position for fear of losing certain contributions
4389913 it is very difficult for me to accept that people dont consciously or subconsciously tailor their views to where they know the sources of campaign funding can be
4389914 how are we going to raise money from those guys if we deregulate them
4389915 should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled their views about global warming will change accordingly therefore you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate
4389916 as real a revolution in the principles of government as that of 1776 was in its form
4389917 it wouldnt have taken a genius long to recognize the corrupting influence of money in american politics
4389918 but it took me a long time to recognize it
4389919 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4389920 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4389921 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4389922 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4389923 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4389924 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4389925 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4389926 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4389927 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4389928 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4389929 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4389930 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4389931 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4389932 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4389933 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4389934 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4389935 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4389936 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4389937 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4389938 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4389939 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4389940 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4389941 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4389942 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4389943 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4389944 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4389945 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4389946 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4389947 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4389948 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4389949 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4389950 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4389951 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4389952 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4389953 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4389954 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4389955 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4389956 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4389957 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4389958 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
4389959 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4389960 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4389961 la bce va sans doute commencer r duire ses taux dint r t au d but de lann e prochaine et ce sera un facteur cl qui contribuera affaiblir davantage leuro
4389962 nous avons problablement vu le pic de leuro quand il tait 1 60 dollar
4389963 nous ne sommes pas persuad s de voir une quelconque hausse des taux aux etats unis cette ann e ce qui aurait pour effet de d cevoir les march s
4389964 faisant craindre que cela ne force la fed augmenter ses taux alors m me que l conomie se d t riore
4389965 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4389966 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4389967 we must lower gas prices and a chicken in every pot for every voting american
4389968 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
4389969 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4389970 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4389971 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4389972 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4389973 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4389974 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4389975 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4389976 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4389977 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4389978 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4389979 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4389980 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4389981 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4389982 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4389983 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4389984 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4389985 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4389986 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4389987 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4389988 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4389989 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4389990 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4389991 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4389992 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4389993 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4389994 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4389995 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4389996 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4389997 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4389998 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4389999 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
